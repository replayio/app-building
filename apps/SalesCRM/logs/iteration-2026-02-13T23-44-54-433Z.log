## Strategy Instructions

### buildInitialApp.md

# Strategy

You are building an application based on the provided AppSpec.md.
You will build the app in the following stages, with strategy files to additional instructions.

1. testSpec.md: Create a detailed test specification for the tests the app must pass in order to match the app spec.

2. writeApp.md: Write the app's code according to the two specs.

3. writeTests.md: Write the tests according to the two specs.

4. testing.md: Get all tests to pass, debugging and fixing the app / tests as needed.

5. deployment.md: Deploy the app to production.

## Development Process

ULTRA IMPORTANT: Follow these directions exactly.

1. Look for files `logs/iteration-...` describing recent changes made. While there are any,
   follow instructions from this file to process them
   reviewChanges.md
2. Read `docs/plan.md` (if it exists) to understand current progress. If there is no plan, create the file with one "Unpack Subtasks" task for each stage.
3. Pick the next task and announce `IMPLEMENT: <TaskName>`.
4. Read the instructions for the associated stage (if you haven't already) and implement the task.
5. After every significant change or when the task requires it, run typecheck and lint, fix any errors, then commit.
6. Update `docs/plan.md` to reflect progress.
7. If any changes were committed, you ABSOLUTELY MUST IMMEDIATELY EXIT. You will restart afterwards with a fresh context.

## Required Environment Variables

```
NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN
NEON_API_KEY
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN
RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY
```

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** for build tooling
- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)
- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)
- **Redux** for client side state management
- **shadcn/ui** for components
- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).
- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.
- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.

## Database

The app must support `npm run init-db` which creates a new Neon database and configures the app to connect to it. This should read NEON_API_KEY from the environment. Use this database for all testing, do not set up a local copy of anything or any proxies.

All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific frontend components.

## Quality Gates

Before each commit:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass with no errors
- `npx eslint .` must pass with no errors

Do not commit code that fails typecheck or lint.

## Documentation

Maintain `docs/plan.md` with:
- High-level app structure and architecture
- Feature breakdown with status (done / in progress / todo)
- Any blockers or decisions made
- Pending and completed tasks. All tasks must be of the form "TaskName: Description"

## Commits

- Commit after every significant change (new feature, bug fix, refactor).
- Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.
- Never commit code that fails typecheck or lint.

## Instructions

Pick an unfinished task and start working on it.

Focus on one task at a time. Do it well rather than rushing through multiple tasks. If the task is associated with one of the stages of app development, read the additional instructions for that stage from the files listed above.

When you finish a task, mark it completed in the plan. Your work is not finished until all remaining tasks are addressed.

Describe your thoughts in detail when writing code or specs and using tools.

Look for files `logs/iteration-...` describing recent changes made. While there are any,\n   follow instructions from this file to process them\n   reviewChanges.md\n2. Read `docs/plan.md` (if it exists) to understand current progress. If there is no plan, create the file with one \"Unpack Subtasks\" task for each stage.\n3. Pick the next task and announce `IMPLEMENT: <TaskName>`.\n4. Read the instructions for the associated stage (if you haven't already) and implement the task.\n5. After every significant change or when the task requires it, run typecheck and lint, fix any errors, then commit.\n6. Update `docs/plan.md` to reflect progress.\n7. If any changes were committed, you ABSOLUTELY MUST IMMEDIATELY EXIT. You will restart afterwards with a fresh context.\n\n## Required Environment Variables\n\n```\nNETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG\nNETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN\nNEON_API_KEY\nUPLOADTHING_TOKEN\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nThe app must support `npm run init-db` which creates a new Neon database and configures the app to connect to it. This should read NEON_API_KEY from the environment. Use this database for all testing, do not set up a local copy of anything or any proxies.\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific frontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit:\n- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass with no errors\n- `npx eslint .` must pass with no errors\n\nDo not commit code that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Documentation\n\nMaintain `docs/plan.md` with:\n- High-level app structure and architecture\n- Feature breakdown with status (done / in progress / todo)\n- Any blockers or decisions made\n- Pending and completed tasks. All tasks must be of the form \"TaskName: Description\"\n\n## Commits\n\n- Commit after every significant change (new feature, bug fix, refactor).\n- Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.\n- Never commit code that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Instructions\n\nPick an unfinished task and start working on it.\n\nFocus on one task at a time. Do it well rather than rushing through multiple tasks. If the task is associated with one of the stages of app development, read the additional instructions for that stage from the files listed above.\n\nWhen you finish a task, mark it completed in the plan. Your work is not finished until all remaining tasks are addressed.\n\nDescribe your thoughts in detail when writing code or specs and using tools.\n\n\n## Current Repository Context\n\n## AppSpec.md\n\nApp: Sales CRM\nInitial Prompt: Basic CRM for tracking relationships with existing clients and prospects.  data structure:\n\nClient (org or individual)\n> source info\n> tags\n> next tasks / task history (can be associated with a deal)\n> attachments (can be associated with a deal)\n> individuals associated with the client\n>> relationships with other individuals\n>> history of contact with this individual\n> current status (active / inactive / prospect / churned)\n> deals\n>> deal stage / history\n>> writeups\n\n\nPages:\n\n1.

width)\n├── QuickActions (full width)\n├── SourceInfoSection (full width)\n└── Two-column grid:\n    ├── Left column:\n    │   ├── TasksSection\n    │   ├── DealsSection\n    │   └── AttachmentsSection\n    └── Right column:\n        ├── PeopleSection\n        └── TimelineSection\n```\n\n### Key Interaction Patterns\n\n1. **Edit Mode Components** (ClientHeader, SourceInfoSection):\n   - Toggle between view and edit mode\n   - Save/Cancel buttons to confirm/discard changes\n   - onUpdate callback to parent page\n\n2. **Modal Components** (AddTaskModal, AddDealModal, AddAttachmentModal, AddPersonModal):\n   - Controlled by open boolean\n   - onClose callback for dismissal\n   - onSave callback with validated form data\n   - Validation prevents save until required fields filled\n\n3. **List Sections** (TasksSection, DealsSection, PeopleSection, AttachmentsSection, TimelineSection):\n   - Empty state messages when no data\n   - Clickable items for navigation (except Timeline)\n   - TasksSection has checkbox toggle for completion\n   - AttachmentsSection has download/view/delete actions\n\n4. **Data Flow**:\n   - Page loads client data via Redux (fetchClient, updateClient)\n   - Additional data loaded via API calls (tasks, deals, attachments, people, timeline)\n   - Modal interactions POST/PUT/DELETE to serverless functions\n   - Page reloads data after mutations\n\n---\n\n## Testing Recommendations\n\n1. **Add data-testid attributes** to all interactive elements (inputs, buttons, select elements)\n2. **Use testId patterns** consistently: `{section}-{element}-{identifier}`\n3. **Test each modal** independently with various form states\n4. **Test edit mode toggles** for ClientHeader and SourceInfoSection\n5. **Test empty states** for all list sections\n6. **Test navigation** from clickable items (deals, people, tasks with deal links)\n7. **Test list interactions** (task completion toggle, attachment deletion)\n8. **Test form validation** in modals (required field checks)\n\n---\n\n## File Paths\n\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientDetailPage.tsx`\n-

Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile my findings into a comprehensive summary.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've found all the information you need to write proper Playwright E2E tests for navigating to a client detail page. Here's what I discovered:\n\n### 1. **Routing Configuration**\n\nThe client detail route is defined in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`:\n\n```typescript\n<Route path=\"/clients/:clientId\" element={<ClientDetailPage />} />\n```\n\n**Route structure:**\n- Base path: `/clients`\n- Detail path: `/clients/:clientId` (where `:clientId` is a UUID parameter)\n\n**How to navigate in tests:**\n```typescript\nawait page.goto(`/clients/${clientId}`);\n```\n\nThe ClientDetailPage fetches the client ID from the URL parameter:\n```typescript\nconst { clientId } = useParams()\n```\n\n### 2. **Seed Data / Database Setup**\n\nThere is **no pre-existing seed data script** in the current codebase. However, here's how to work with test data:\n\n**Database Schema File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/init-db.ts`\n\nThis script initializes the complete database schema with these tables:\n- `clients` (with id UUID, name, type, status, tags, source info, etc.)\n- `individuals`\n- `client_individuals` (junction table)\n- `deals`\n- `tasks`\n- `attachments`\n- `timeline_events`\n- And supporting tables\n\n**To get a known client ID for tests, you'll need to:**\n\n1. **Option A - Create test data via API before your tests:**\n   ```typescript\n   // In your test setup\n   const clientRes = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/clients', {\n     method: 'POST',\n     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n     body: JSON.stringify({\n       name: 'Test Corp',\n       type: 'organization',\n       status: 'prospect'\n     })\n   });\n   const client = await clientRes.json();\n   const clientId = client.id; // Use this for navigation\n   ```\n\n2. **Option B - Query existing clients first:**\n   ```typescript\n   const clientsRes = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/clients?page=1');\n   const data = await clientsRes.json();\n   const clientId = data.clients[0].id; // Use first existing client\n   ```\n\n### 3. **Netlify Functions File Paths**\n\nHere are the exact file paths for the client-related netlify functions:\n\n| Function | Path |\n|----------|------|\n| **client-tasks** | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/client-tasks.ts` |\n| **client-deals** | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/client-deals.ts` |\n| **client-attachments** | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/client-attachments.ts` |\n| **client-people** | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/client-people.ts` |\n| **client-timeline** | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/client-timeline.ts` |\n\n**API Endpoint Patterns:**\n\nAll functions expect a `clientId` query parameter:\n\n```typescript\n// GET client data\nfetch(`/.netlify/functions/client-tasks?clientId=${clientId}`)\nfetch(`/.netlify/functions/client-deals?clientId=${clientId}`)\nfetch(`/.netlify/functions/client-attachments?clientId=${clientId}`)\nfetch(`/.netlify/functions/client-people?clientId=${clientId}`)\nfetch(`/.netlify/functions/client-timeline?clientId=${clientId}`)\n```\n\n### 4. **Test Configuration**\n\nYour existing Playwright config at `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/playwright.config.ts` is already set up:\n\n```typescript\nbaseURL: 'http://localhost:8888',\ntestDir: './tests',\nwebServer: {\n  command: 'npx netlify dev --port 8888',\n  url: 'http://localhost:8888',\n  timeout: 30000,\n}\n```\n\n**Helper functions available** in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/helpers.ts`:\n- `navigateTo(page, path)` - Navigate and wait for load\n- `assertUrl(page, path)` - Verify URL\n- `waitForAppLoad(page)` - Wait for network idle\n- `countByTestId(page, testId)` - Count elements\n\n### **Recommended Test Pattern**\n\nBased on the existing test file (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`), here's a recommended pattern:\n\n```typescript\ntest('Navigate to client detail page', async ({ page }) => {\n  // Get a known client ID (from API or existing client)\n  const clientRes = await fetch('http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/clients?page=1');\n  const { clients } = await clientRes.json();\n  const clientId = clients[0].id;\n  \n  // Navigate to client detail\n  await page.goto(`/clients/${clientId}`);\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n  \n  // Verify client detail loads\n  await expect(page.getByTestId('client-header')).toBeVisible();\n});\n```\n\nAll the pieces are ready for you to write comprehensive E2E tests!"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a6f153f (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 53045\ntool_uses: 34\nduration_ms: 42375</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7ce698e0-1bf0-444b-92b1-aa00c9af30fb","uuid":"7d836387-a4ef-42ca-b565-e85cb4696a5c","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"In /repo/apps/SalesCRM, find:\n1.
