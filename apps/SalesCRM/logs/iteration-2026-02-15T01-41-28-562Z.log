(31 more lines)\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\nFunctions are now loading. The fix was using `apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions` instead of `netlify/functions` because `baseRelDir: false` means paths are relative to the repo root. But wait - this will break the production deployment since Netlify's build system may handle this differently. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the debug output earlier: `baseRelDir: false` is a UI setting. In production Netlify, when `base` is set, the `functions` path is resolved relative to the repository root when `baseRelDir` is false, or relative to the base when it's true. For `netlify dev`, it seems to also use the repo root. So using `apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions` should work for both local dev and production.\n\nBut the tests passed before with the original config. Let me check whether the original test runs happened from a different setup or if there was a different netlify configuration.\n\nLet me just verify that this doesn't break the production deploy. The deploy log from the previous iteration showed the app deployed successfully at the original path. If I change this, I might need to redeploy. Let me check the Netlify site settings.\n\u001b[35m$ pkill -f \"netlify\" 2>/dev/null; pkill -f \"vite\" 2>/dev/null; sleep 2; echo \"killed\"\u001b[0m\nActually, let me check the Netlify site to understand how baseRelDir is configured for production vs dev.\n\u001b[35m$ npx netlify api getSite --data '{}' 2>&1 | grep -i \"base\\|function\\|build\" | head -20\u001b[0m\n\u001b[35m$ npx netlify status 2>&1 | head -20\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2m──────────────────────┐\n Current Netlify User │\n──────────────────────┘\nName:  Brian Hackett\nEmail: bhackett1024@gmail.com\nTeams: \n  Replay: Owner Developer Billing Admin Reviewer Publisher Content Editor\n────────────────────┐\n Netlify Site Info  │\n────────────────────┘\nCurrent site: sales-crm-1771041441\nNetlify TOML: /repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify.toml\nAdmin URL:    https://app.netlify.com/projects/sales-crm-1771041441\nSite URL:     https://sales-crm-1771041441.netlify.app\nSite Id:      7ecd17c5-336d-45ec-ba63-5d0a0317c7cf\u001b[0m\nThe site already has `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` configured.

There's nothing more to maintain at this point.\n\n<DONE/>\n\nMaintenance Round 1 is fully complete.

The issue is `baseRelDir: false`. When `baseRelDir` is false, the functions directory is resolved relative to the repo root, not the base directory.

(31 more lines)\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\nFunctions are now loading. The fix was using `apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions` instead of `netlify/functions` because `baseRelDir: false` means paths are relative to the repo root. But wait - this will break the production deployment since Netlify's build system may handle this differently. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the debug output earlier: `baseRelDir: false` is a UI setting. In production Netlify, when `base` is set, the `functions` path is resolved relative to the repository root when `baseRelDir` is false, or relative to the base when it's true. For `netlify dev`, it seems to also use the repo root. So using `apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions` should work for both local dev and production.\n\nBut the tests passed before with the original config. Let me check whether the original test runs happened from a different setup or if there was a different netlify configuration.\n\nLet me just verify that this doesn't break the production deploy. The deploy log from the previous iteration showed the app deployed successfully at the original path. If I change this, I might need to redeploy.

Let me provide a comprehensive summary of all attachment-related files in the SalesCRM app.\n\n## Attachment Display Files in SalesCRM\n\nHere's a complete breakdown of the attachment-related components and backend functions:\n\n### 1. Client Detail Page Attachment Components\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AttachmentsSection.tsx`\n- **Purpose:** Displays a list of attachments for a client\n- **Features:**\n  - Shows file icon for documents, link icon for URLs\n  - Displays filename, type (Document/Link), creation date, and associated deal name\n  - Download button for documents, View button for links\n  - Delete button for removing attachments\n  - Empty state message when no attachments exist\n- **Props:**\n  - `attachments: Attachment[]` - Array of attachment objects\n  - `onDelete: (attachmentId: string) => void` - Callback for deletion\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddAttachmentModal.tsx`\n- **Purpose:** Modal for adding attachments to a client (with optional deal association)\n- **Features:**\n  - Toggle between \"File Upload\" and \"Link URL\" modes\n  - File input with size display in KB\n  - URL input with optional link name\n  - Deal association dropdown (optional)\n  - Uses `URL.createObjectURL()` for file blob handling\n- **Props:**\n  - `open: boolean` - Modal visibility\n  - `onClose: () => void` - Close handler\n  - `onSave: (data: {...}) => void` - Save handler\n  - `deals: Deal[]` - Available deals for association\n\n### 2. Deal Detail Page Attachment Components\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/DealAttachmentsSection.tsx`\n- **Purpose:** Displays attachments specific to a deal\n- **Features:**\n  - Upload button in header for adding attachments\n  - Shows filename and file size (MB/KB/B conversion)\n  - Download link for each attachment\n  - Delete button for each attachment\n  - Empty state message\n  - Simplified UI compared to client attachments (no type icons, deal names)\n- **Props:**\n  - `attachments: Attachment[]` - Deal's attachments\n  - `onUpload: () => void` - Upload button callback\n  - `onDelete: (attachmentId: string) => void` - Delete callback\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/UploadAttachmentModal.tsx`\n- **Purpose:** Modal for uploading attachments to a deal\n- **Features:**\n  - Filename input field\n  - Type selector (Document/Link dropdown)\n  - URL input field (for file URL or link URL)\n  - Does NOT include deal association (assumed from context)\n- **Props:**\n  - `open: boolean` - Modal visibility\n  - `onClose: () => void` - Close handler\n  - `onSave: (data: {...}) => void` - Save handler\n\n### 3.

I now have a complete understanding of the filter controls and dropdown components used on the deals page. Let me create a comprehensive summary of my findings.\n\n## Summary: Deals List Page Filter Controls and Dropdowns\n\nBased on my analysis of the SalesCRM deals page, here are the filter controls and dropdown/select components:\n\n### 1. **Filter Dropdowns on DealsListPage**\n\nThe main filter controls are located in the **DealsFilterControls** component, which displays 4 dropdown filters plus date range inputs:\n\n1. **Stage Filter** - Dropdown select\n2. **Client Filter** - Dropdown select  \n3. **Status Filter** - Dropdown select\n4. **Sort By Filter** - Dropdown select\n5. **Date Range Filters** - Two native date inputs (from/to)\n\n### 2. **Implementation Details**\n\n#### **DealsFilterControls Component**\n**File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsFilterControls.tsx`\n\n**Implementation Type**: Custom native HTML `<select>` elements with styling\n\n**Key Features**:\n- Uses a custom `FilterSelect` component that wraps native HTML `<select>` elements\n- Custom styled with Tailwind CSS classes\n- Includes a ChevronDown icon from lucide-react as a visual indicator\n- All dropdowns use the same custom `FilterSelect` component (lines 19-53)\n\n**Filter Options**:\n\n| Filter | Options | Values |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| **Stage** | All Stages, Lead, Qualification, Discovery, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost | `''`, `'lead'`, `'qualification'`, `'discovery'`, `'proposal'`, `'negotiation'`, `'closed_won'`, `'closed_lost'` |\n| **Client** | All Clients, [Dynamic list from availableClients prop] | `''`, client IDs |\n| **Status** | All, Active, On Track, Needs Attention, At Risk, Won, Lost, On Hold | `''`, `'active'`, `'on_track'`, `'needs_attention'`, `'at_risk'`, `'won'`, `'lost'`, `'on_hold'` |\n| **Sort By** | Close Date (Newest), Close Date (Oldest), Name A-Z, Name Z-A, Value (High-Low), Value (Low-High) | `'close_date_desc'`, `'close_date_asc'`, `'name_asc'`, `'name_desc'`, `'value_desc'`, `'value_asc'` |\n\n**Styling** (lines 34-51):\n```html\n<select>\n  className=\"appearance-none h-[34px] pl-3 pr-7 text-[13px] \n    text-text-secondary bg-surface border border-border rounded-[5px] \n    cursor-pointer hover:bg-hover focus:outline-none focus:border-accent \n    transition-colors duration-100\"\n</select>\n```\n\n### 3. **Additional Dropdown Components on Deals Page**\n\n#### **CreateDealModal Component**\n**File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/CreateDealModal.tsx`\n\nContains 2 additional native `<select>` elements:\n\n1. **Client Dropdown** (lines 76-86)\n   - Shows all available clients\n   - Required field\n\n2. **Stage Dropdown** (lines 104-113)\n   - Shows predefined deal stages: Lead, Qualification, Discovery, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Closed Won\n   - Defaults to 'Lead'\n\nBoth use native HTML `<select>` elements with similar styling to the filter controls.\n\n### 4. **Component Hierarchy**\n\n```\nDealsListPage.tsx\n├── DealsFilterControls.tsx\n│   └── FilterSelect (internal component - lines 19-53)\n│       └── Native <select> element\n└── CreateDealModal.tsx\n    └── 2x Native <select> elements\n```\n\n### 5. **Key Technical Details**\n\n- **Type**: Native HTML `<select>` elements (NOT shadcn select, NOT custom React select libraries)\n- **Icon Library**: lucide-react (ChevronDown icon)\n- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS\n- **State Management**: React hooks (useState) with callbacks for parent component updates\n- **Test IDs**: Each filter has data-testid attributes for testing:\n  - `deals-filter-stage`\n  - `deals-filter-client`\n  - `deals-filter-status`\n  - `deals-filter-sort`\n  - `deals-filter-date-from`\n  - `deals-filter-date-to`\n\n### 6. **File Paths Summary**\n\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealsListPage.tsx` - Main page component\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsFilterControls.tsx` - Filter controls with 4 dropdowns\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/CreateDealModal.tsx` - Modal with 2 additional dropdowns"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ab7586f (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 25782\ntool_uses: 8\nduration_ms: 15996</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1b3cdbe8-d256-4cc5-8532-0000270df63f","uuid":"51d10068-63b1-475e-aae3-92d3d8b8bd3a","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"In /repo/apps/SalesCRM, find the deals list page filter controls and any dropdown/select components used on the deals page.

Let me create a comprehensive summary of my findings.\n\n## Summary: Deals List Page Filter Controls and Dropdowns\n\nBased on my analysis of the SalesCRM deals page, here are the filter controls and dropdown/select components:\n\n### 1. **Filter Dropdowns on DealsListPage**\n\nThe main filter controls are located in the **DealsFilterControls** component, which displays 4 dropdown filters plus date range inputs:\n\n1. **Stage Filter** - Dropdown select\n2. **Client Filter** - Dropdown select  \n3. **Status Filter** - Dropdown select\n4. **Sort By Filter** - Dropdown select\n5. **Date Range Filters** - Two native date inputs (from/to)\n\n### 2. **Implementation Details**\n\n#### **DealsFilterControls Component**\n**File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsFilterControls.tsx`\n\n**Implementation Type**: Custom native HTML `<select>` elements with styling\n\n**Key Features**:\n- Uses a custom `FilterSelect` component that wraps native HTML `<select>` elements\n- Custom styled with Tailwind CSS classes\n- Includes a ChevronDown icon from lucide-react as a visual indicator\n- All dropdowns use the same custom `FilterSelect` component (lines 19-53)\n\n**Filter Options**:\n\n| Filter | Options | Values |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| **Stage** | All Stages, Lead, Qualification, Discovery, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost | `''`, `'lead'`, `'qualification'`, `'discovery'`, `'proposal'`, `'negotiation'`, `'closed_won'`, `'closed_lost'` |\n| **Client** | All Clients, [Dynamic list from availableClients prop] | `''`, client IDs |\n| **Status** | All, Active, On Track, Needs Attention, At Risk, Won, Lost, On Hold | `''`, `'active'`, `'on_track'`, `'needs_attention'`, `'at_risk'`, `'won'`, `'lost'`, `'on_hold'` |\n| **Sort By** | Close Date (Newest), Close Date (Oldest), Name A-Z, Name Z-A, Value (High-Low), Value (Low-High) | `'close_date_desc'`, `'close_date_asc'`, `'name_asc'`, `'name_desc'`, `'value_desc'`, `'value_asc'` |\n\n**Styling** (lines 34-51):\n```html\n<select>\n  className=\"appearance-none h-[34px] pl-3 pr-7 text-[13px] \n    text-text-secondary bg-surface border border-border rounded-[5px] \n    cursor-pointer hover:bg-hover focus:outline-none focus:border-accent \n    transition-colors duration-100\"\n</select>\n```\n\n### 3. **Additional Dropdown Components on Deals Page**\n\n#### **CreateDealModal Component**\n**File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/CreateDealModal.tsx`\n\nContains 2 additional native `<select>` elements:\n\n1. **Client Dropdown** (lines 76-86)\n   - Shows all available clients\n   - Required field\n\n2. **Stage Dropdown** (lines 104-113)\n   - Shows predefined deal stages: Lead, Qualification, Discovery, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Closed Won\n   - Defaults to 'Lead'\n\nBoth use native HTML `<select>` elements with similar styling to the filter controls.\n\n### 4. **Component Hierarchy**\n\n```\nDealsListPage.tsx\n├── DealsFilterControls.tsx\n│   └── FilterSelect (internal component - lines 19-53)\n│       └── Native <select> element\n└── CreateDealModal.tsx\n    └── 2x Native <select> elements\n```\n\n### 5. **Key Technical Details**\n\n- **Type**: Native HTML `<select>` elements (NOT shadcn select, NOT custom React select libraries)\n- **Icon Library**: lucide-react (ChevronDown icon)\n- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS\n- **State Management**: React hooks (useState) with callbacks for parent component updates\n- **Test IDs**: Each filter has data-testid attributes for testing:\n  - `deals-filter-stage`\n  - `deals-filter-client`\n  - `deals-filter-status`\n  - `deals-filter-sort`\n  - `deals-filter-date-from`\n  - `deals-filter-date-to`\n\n### 6. **File Paths Summary**\n\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealsListPage.tsx` - Main page component\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsFilterControls.tsx` - Filter controls with 4 dropdowns\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/CreateDealModal.tsx` - Modal with 2 additional dropdowns"}],"totalDurationMs":15996,"totalTokens":25782,"totalToolUseCount":8,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2724,"cache_read_input_tokens":21817,"output_tokens":1235,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2724},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Tasks Backend Function (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/tasks.ts`)\n\nThe backend supports the following CRUD operations:\n\n**GET /tasks** (lines 16-72): Lists upcoming (uncompleted) tasks with filters\n- Query params: `search`, `priority`, `assignee`, `clientId`, `includeCompleted`\n- Returns: Array of tasks with joined client/deal names, total count, available assignees dropdown, available clients dropdown\n- Ordering: By due_date ASC, then created_at DESC\n\n**POST /tasks** (lines 74-123): Creates a new task\n- Required: `title`\n- Optional: `description`, `due_date`, `priority` (default: 'normal'), `client_id`, `deal_id`, `assignee_name`, `assignee_role`\n- Creates timeline event if client_id provided\n- Returns: Created task with status 201\n\n**PUT /tasks/:taskId** (lines 125-180): Updates a task\n- Fields: `completed`, `title`, `description`, `due_date`, `priority`, `assignee_name`, `assignee_role`\n- Handles completed_at timestamp (sets to NOW() on completion, NULL on uncomplete)\n- Creates timeline event for completion\n- Returns: Updated task\n\n**DELETE /tasks/:taskId** (lines 182-186): Deletes a task\n- Returns: `{ success: true }`\n\n### 3.

TasksListPage and Components\n\n**Main Page:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TasksListPage.tsx`\n- Manages state for filter/search, create/edit modals, delete confirmation\n- Loads tasks on filter changes with debounced search (300ms)\n- Navigation: Clicking a task navigates to deal detail (if linked) or client detail\n- Fetches all clients and deals for create modal dropdowns\n\n**Component Files:**\n\n1. **TasksPageHeader** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/TasksPageHeader.tsx`)\n   - Title: \"Upcoming Tasks\"\n   - Button: \"New Task\" (accent colored, with Plus icon)\n\n2. **TaskCard** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx`)\n   - Displays: Priority badge, title, due date (formatted as \"Today, 2:30 PM\" or \"Tomorrow\", or date), assignee avatar + name + role\n   - Action menu with: Edit, Mark Complete, Delete\n   - Clickable card navigates to associated deal/client\n\n3. **TaskPriorityBadge** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/TaskPriorityBadge.tsx`)\n   - Color-coded badges: High (red), Medium (amber), Low (green), Normal (blue)\n\n4. **TasksFilterBar** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/TasksFilterBar.tsx`)\n   - Dropdowns: Priority, Assignee, Client\n   - Text search input with \"Filter...\" placeholder\n   - Clear all filters button (shown when filters active)\n\n5. **CreateTaskModal** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/CreateTaskModal.tsx`)\n   - Fields: Title (required), Description, Due Date, Priority, Assignee Name, Assignee Role, Client, Deal (filtered by client)\n   - Deal dropdown only shows deals for selected client\n\n6. **EditTaskModal** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/EditTaskModal.tsx`)\n   - Same fields as create modal (minus client/deal selection)\n   - Pre-fills form with current task data\n\n### 5.

[2026-02-15T01:25:20.997Z] {"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. User asked to read `/repo/strategies/maintainApp.md` and follow instructions exactly.\n\n2. I read the maintainApp.md strategy which outlined a maintenance workflow:\n   - Review unreviewed iteration logs\n   - Add maintenance round section to plan.md\n   - Unpack bug reports into subtasks\n   - Fix bugs, update tests, resolve bugs\n   - Check directives, polish, deploy\n\n3. I read plan.md and found \"Maintenance Round 1 COMPLETE\", meaning this is Maintenance Round 2.\n\n4. I read multiple strategy files (performTasks.md, fixBugReport.md, reviewBugReport.md, checkDirectives.md, polishApp.md, deployment.md).\n\n5. I found one unreviewed iteration log: `iteration-2026-02-14T23-47-47-920Z.log`. Reviewed it - it covered Maintenance Round 1 completion (directive violations fixed, deployed). Copied to reviewed/.\n\n6. Read bugReports.md - found 6 open bug reports:\n   - Dashboard/Clients duplicate highlight\n   - Reports link 404\n   - Settings button does nothing\n   - Add task detail page\n   - Deals dropdown styling\n   - Attachment preview\n\n7. Added Maintenance Round 2 section to plan.md with unpacked subtasks for all 6 bugs.\n\n8. **Bug 1: Attachment Preview**\n   - Analyzed: AttachmentsSection.tsx and DealAttachmentsSection.tsx both use generic icons\n   - Created shared/AttachmentPreview.tsx component with file-type-specific icons and image thumbnails\n   - Created shared/attachmentUtils.ts with getFileCategory and getFileTypeLabel\n   - Updated both section components to use new preview\n   - Had ESLint errors: unused `isImageFile` function (removed), react-refresh warning (split exports into separate files)\n   - Updated CDP-ATT-02 test assertions for new type labels\n   - Updated test spec entries\n   - All 9 ATT tests passing\n   - Committed: `0cd095c`\n\n9. **Bug 2: Deals Dropdown Styling**\n   - Analyzed: DealsFilterControls uses native `<select>` elements\n   - Rewrote FilterSelect to use custom dropdown with React state, styled menu, click-outside-to-close\n   - Updated all DLP-FLT tests (01-07) from selectOption/option locators to click-based interactions\n   - All 8 DLP-FLT tests passing\n   - Committed: `78daa0a`\n\n10. **Bugs 3-5: Sidebar issues (Dashboard, Reports, Settings)**\n    - Analyzed: Sidebar.tsx had Dashboard→/clients (duplicate), Reports→/reports (no route), Settings→/settings (no route)\n    - Removed all three from sidebar, keeping only Clients, Deals, Tasks\n    - Updated CLP-NAV-01 test\n    - Updated test spec\n    - Both CLP-NAV tests passing\n    - Committed: `fc47dd2`\n\n11. **Bug 6: Task Detail Page (in progress)**\n    - Added `task_notes` table to init-db.ts\n    - Added GET /tasks/:taskId endpoint (returns task + notes)\n    - Added POST /tasks/:taskId/notes and DELETE /tasks/:taskId/notes/:noteId endpoints\n    - Added TaskNote type to types/index.ts\n    - Created TaskDetailHeader.tsx component\n    - Created TaskNotesSection.tsx component\n    - Created TaskDetailPage.tsx page\n    - Added route `/tasks/:taskId` to App.tsx\n    - Updated TasksListPage handleTaskClick to navigate to `/tasks/${task.id}` instead of deal/client\n    - Ran init-db and seed-db to create task_notes table\n    - Wrote 7 Playwright tests in task-detail-page.spec.ts\n    - Fixed test ID: `create-task-button` → `new-task-button`\n    - All 7 TDP tests passing\n    - All 18 TLP tests still passing\n    - NOT YET COMMITTED\n\nCurrent state: The task detail page implementation is complete and all tests pass, but hasn't been committed yet. Need to:\n- Update plan.md to mark task detail page tasks complete\n- Update bugReports.md to move this bug to Unreviewed\n- Commit\n- Then continue with remaining maintenance round 2 tasks (reviewBugReport, checkDirectives, polishApp, deployment)\n- Run full test suite\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user asked to read `/repo/strategies/maintainApp.md` and follow the instructions exactly. This strategy defines a maintenance workflow for the SalesCRM app: review unreviewed iteration logs, add a maintenance round section to `plan.md`, unpack and fix bug reports, check directives, polish, and deploy. This is Maintenance Round 2 (Round 1 was already complete).\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Maintenance workflow strategy pattern: iteration log review → bug fix → directive check → polish → deploy\n   - SalesCRM is a React + Vite + TypeScript app with Netlify Functions backend and Neon PostgreSQL\n   - Playwright E2E tests with Replay browser\n   - Custom dropdown components replacing native `<select>` for consistent styling\n   - File type detection utility for attachment previews\n   - Task notes as a sub-resource pattern (REST: `/tasks/:taskId/notes`)\n   - React Router with `NavLink` for sidebar navigation\n   - `data-testid` attributes for all interactive elements (directive requirement)\n   - Neon serverless driver with tagged template literal SQL syntax only\n   - `ConfirmDialog` shared component requires `open` prop\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`/repo/strategies/maintainApp.md`** - The main strategy file driving all work. Defines maintenance round workflow.\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md`** - Project plan tracking all tasks. Added \"Maintenance Round 2\" section with unpacked subtasks for 6 bugs. Tasks are being checked off as completed.\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md`** - Bug tracking file. Restructured with Open/Unreviewed sections. 5 of 6 bugs moved to Unreviewed (task detail page pending).\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/AttachmentPreview.tsx`** - New component for file-type-specific icons and image thumbnails:\n     ```tsx\n     import { getFileCategory } from './attachmentUtils'\n     // CategoryIcon renders different lucide-react icons based on file category\n     // AttachmentPreview shows thumbnail for images, icon for others\n     export function AttachmentPreview({ filename, url, type }: AttachmentPreviewProps) {\n       const [imgError, setImgError] = useState(false)\n       const category = getFileCategory(filename, type)\n       const showThumbnail = category === 'image' && !imgError && url\n       // renders 8x8 thumbnail or icon box\n     }\n     ```\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/attachmentUtils.ts`** - Utility for file extension detection and labels. Split from AttachmentPreview.tsx to fix react-refresh ESLint warning.\n     ```ts\n     export function getFileCategory(filename: string, type: 'document' | 'link'): FileCategory\n     export function getFileTypeLabel(filename: string, type: 'document' | 'link'): string\n     ```\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AttachmentsSection.tsx`** - Updated imports from `FileText, LinkIcon` to use `AttachmentPreview` and `getFileTypeLabel`. Type label now shows specific type (Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) instead of just \"Document\"/\"Link\".\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/DealAttachmentsSection.tsx`** - Updated similarly, replacing `FileText` icon with `AttachmentPreview`, adding file type label.\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsFilterControls.tsx`** - Completely rewrote `FilterSelect` from native `<select>` to custom dropdown:\n     ```tsx\n     function FilterSelect({ label, value, options, onChange, testId }) {\n       const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)\n       const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)\n       // click-outside-to-close via useEffect\n       return (\n         <div ref={ref} data-testid={testId} data-value={value}>\n           <button data-testid={`${testId}-trigger`} onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>\n             {displayText}\n           </button>\n           {open && (\n             <div data-testid={`${testId}-menu`}>\n               {options.map(opt => (\n                 <button data-testid={`${testId}-option-${opt.value || 'all'}`}\n                   onClick={() => { onChange(opt.value); setOpen(false) }}>\n                   {opt.label}\n                 </button>\n               ))}\n             </div>\n           )}\n         </div>\n       )\n     }\n     ```\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`** - Removed Dashboard (duplicate /clients), Reports (no route), and Settings (no route). Now only has Clients, Deals, Tasks. Removed unused lucide imports (LayoutDashboard, BarChart3, Settings).\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/init-db.ts`** - Added `task_notes` table:\n     ```sql\n     CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS task_notes (\n       id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n       task_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n       content TEXT NOT NULL,\n       author TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'System',\n       created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n     )\n     ```\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/tasks.ts`** - Added three new endpoints:\n     - `GET /tasks/:taskId` - Returns `{ task, notes }` with joined client/deal names\n     - `POST /tasks/:taskId/notes` - Creates a note with `{ content, author }`\n     - `DELETE /tasks/:taskId/notes/:noteId` - Deletes a specific note\n     Added `subResource` parsing: `const subResource = pathParts.length >= 5 ? pathParts[4] : null`\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts`** - Added TaskNote interface:\n     ```ts\n     export interface TaskNote {\n       id: string; task_id: string; content: string; author: string; created_at: string\n     }\n     ```\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/task-detail/TaskDetailHeader.tsx`** - New component showing task title, priority badge, description, due date, assignee, client/deal links, status badge (Open/Completed), Mark Complete and Cancel Task buttons. Back arrow navigates to /tasks.\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/task-detail/TaskNotesSection.tsx`** - New component with textarea input + Add button, notes list with delete buttons, empty state \"No notes yet\".\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TaskDetailPage.tsx`** - New page using `useParams<{taskId}>`, fetches task+notes, handles mark complete (PUT), cancel/delete (DELETE), add note (POST), delete note (DELETE). Uses `ConfirmDialog` with `open` prop.\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`** - Added TaskDetailPage import and route: `<Route path=\"/tasks/:taskId\" element={<TaskDetailPage />} />`\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TasksListPage.tsx`** - Changed `handleTaskClick` from navigating to deal/client to: `navigate(`/tasks/${task.id}`)`\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/task-detail-page.spec.ts`** - New test file with 7 tests (TDP-HDR-01 through TDP-HDR-04, TDP-NTS-01 through TDP-NTS-03). All passing.\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deals-list-page.spec.ts`** - Updated DLP-FLT-01 through DLP-FLT-07 tests from `selectOption`/`locator('option')` to click-based custom dropdown interaction.\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`** - Updated CLP-NAV-01 to remove Dashboard, Reports, Settings assertions.\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/tasks-list-page.spec.ts`** - Updated TLP-CRD-04 from checking `/clients/` or `/deals/` URL to checking `/tasks/:taskId` URL and `task-detail-page` visibility.\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`** - Updated test spec entries for: CDP-ATT-01, DDP-ATT-01 (attachment preview), CLP-NAV-01 (sidebar items), TLP-CRD-04 (task detail navigation). Added new Section 7: TaskDetailPage with TDP-HDR and TDP-NTS test entries.\n   \n   - **Bug analysis docs created**: `docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md`, `docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md`, `docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md`, `docs/bugs/Reports404.md`, `docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md`\n   \n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/logs/reviewed/iteration-2026-02-14T23-47-47-920Z.log`** - Iteration log copied to reviewed/\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **ESLint: unused `isImageFile` function** in AttachmentPreview.tsx → Removed the function\n   - **ESLint: react-refresh/only-export-components warning** when exporting `getFileTypeLabel` from AttachmentPreview.tsx → Split into separate `attachmentUtils.ts` file\n   - **Replay browser not installed**: `browserType.launch: Failed to launch chromium` → Ran `npx [REDACTED]io install`\n   - **Wrong test ID**: Tests used `create-task-button` but actual ID was `new-task-button` → Global replace in task-detail-page.spec.ts\n   - **ConfirmDialog requires `open` prop**: Initially used conditional rendering (`{confirmAction === 'complete' && <ConfirmDialog .../>}`) → Changed to always render with `open={confirmAction === 'complete'}`\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Identified 6 bugs from bugReports.md and systematically addressed each\n   - Fixed 5 of 6 bugs (attachment preview, deals dropdown styling, dashboard highlight, reports 404, settings button)\n   - 6th bug (task detail page) is implemented with all 7 new tests passing plus all 18 existing task tests passing\n   - Three commits made so far: `0cd095c` (attachment preview), `78daa0a` (deals dropdown), `fc47dd2` (sidebar fixes)\n   - Task detail page changes are staged but NOT yet committed\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"Read /repo/strategies/maintainApp.md and follow the instructions exactly.\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Commit the task detail page changes (bug 6)\n   - Update plan.md to mark task detail page tasks complete\n   - Update bugReports.md to move task detail page bug to Unreviewed\n   - Run full test suite (176+ tests) to verify no regressions\n   - Continue with remaining Maintenance Round 2 tasks:\n     - `reviewBugReport.md: UnpackReviewBugReport` - Review the 5 bugs in Unreviewed section\n     - `checkDirectives.md: UnpackCheckDirectives` - Check for directive violations in new code\n     - `polishApp.md: UnpackPolishApp` - Polish the app\n     - `deployment.md: UnpackDeployment` - Deploy to production\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Just completed implementing the Task Detail Page (bug 6 of 6). All 7 new TDP tests pass, all 18 existing TLP tests pass. The implementation includes:\n   - Backend: GET /tasks/:taskId, POST/DELETE notes sub-resource, task_notes table\n   - Frontend: TaskDetailPage, TaskDetailHeader, TaskNotesSection components\n   - Route: /tasks/:taskId added to App.tsx\n   - Navigation: Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId instead of deal/client pages\n   - Tests: 7 new Playwright tests in task-detail-page.spec.ts\n   \n   The changes are NOT yet committed. The last test run showed \"7 passed (29.2s)\" for task-detail-page.spec.ts.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Commit the task detail page changes, update plan.md and bugReports.md, then run the full test suite. Per the maintainApp.md strategy, after all bug fixes are committed, continue with `reviewBugReport.md: UnpackReviewBugReport` to review the 5 bugs now in the Unreviewed section, then `checkDirectives.md`, `polishApp.md`, and `deployment.md`.\n   \n   The user's original request was: \"Read /repo/strategies/maintainApp.md and follow the instructions exactly.\" The strategy workflow continues after bug fixes with review, directives check, polish, and deployment.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /home/node/.claude/projects/-repo-apps-SalesCRM/1b3cdbe8-d256-4cc5-8532-0000270df63f.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions.

ClassifyBug: Classify the app building stage to improve to prevent similar bugs.\n2. UpdateDirectives: Update the directives to avoid the buggy behavior.\n3. FinishBug: Mark the bug as reviewed.\n\n## Classifying bugs\n\nRead about the stages of the structured app building process in buildInitialApp.md.\nYou'll be identifying any problem stage whose instructions need improvements to prevent similar bugs.\nSome bugs do not have problem stages.\n\nFollow these steps to figure out the problem stage (if any). Once you do, update bugReports.md\nto refer to it and move onto the next task.\n\n1. Read the bug report to understand the problem and any associated analysis explaining the bug.\n2. Determine whether the bug is a problem with the app's style or UI. Styling and details of UI behavior\n   are not captured by test specifications. For these bugs the problem stage is `writeApp.md` stage,\n   which has guidelines for writing the app.\n3. Otherwise the bug is a functional problem. All functionality in the app must be covered by a test entry\n   in `docs/tests.md`. Read this file at the point before the bug was fixed, using the git revision info\n   in bugReports.md.\n4. If the old test entries specify the buggy behavior, this bug is a change in app requirements and\n   there is no problem stage.\n5. If the old test entries specify the correct behavior, the tests aren't covering it properly.\n   The problem stage is `writeTests.md` which covers writing playwright tests for the entries.\n6. Otherwise the test entries say nothing about this behavior. If the bug is asking for new functionality,\n   there isn't a problem stage. If the bug is about existing functionality, the test entries are\n   underspecified and the problem stage is `testSpec.md` which covers generation of the spec.\n\n## Updating directives\n\nIf non problem stage was identified for the bug report, skip this task.\n\nRead the strategy file for the stage which breaks down how to perform the stage into\nincreasingly small and well defined tasks. These strategy files have directives for things to watch\nfor when performing a task, which are reviewed afterwards and while maintaining the app to make sure\nthey are all being followed.\n\nCheck to see if the directives already prohibit the bad behavior. If so, add a note on the entry in\nbugReports.md but make no other changes.\n\nIf there is no directive against the bad behavior, add one or update any similar / conflicting directive.\nAdd a note on the entry in bugReports.md about the update made.\n\nDirectives should be general purpose and not include details or examples specific to the app being built.\n\n## Finishing bugs\n\nUpdate `docs/bugReports.md` to move the report from the \"Unreviewed\" section to the \"Finished\" section,\ncreating it at the end if necessary.\n\nCommit all changes and exit.\n","numLines":62,"startLine":1,"totalLines":62}}}

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing plan.md, create and commit plan.md before moving on\n  to PlanPage tasks. This avoids losing the plan if the iteration runs out of turns.\n","numLines":57,"startLine":1,"totalLines":57}}}

If the bug is about style/UI → problem stage is writeApp.md\n2. If the bug is a functional problem → check old test spec (docs/tests.md at the commit BEFORE the fix)\n   a. If old test entries specify the buggy behavior → no problem stage (requirements change)\n   b. If old test entries specify the correct behavior → problem stage is writeTests.md \n   c. If test entries say nothing about this behavior → if asking for new functionality, no problem stage; if about existing functionality, problem stage is testSpec.md\n\nHere are the 6 bugs to classify. For each, I'll provide the bug description, and the relevant old test spec content.\n\n**Bug 1: Dashboard/Clients duplicate highlight**\n- \"When on the clients page both 'dashboard' and 'clients' are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\"\n- Before commit: 78daa0a\n- Please run: `git show 78daa0a:apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md | grep -A 5 -B 2 \"Dashboard\\|SidebarNavigation\\|CLP-NAV\"`\n- The old test spec's SidebarNavigation component description says: \"Left sidebar with nav links (Dashboard, Clients, Deals, Tasks, Reports, Settings)\"\n- The old CLP-NAV-01 test says: \"Sidebar contains links for Dashboard, Clients, Deals, Tasks, Reports, Settings\"\n\n**Bug 2: Reports link 404**\n- \"'Reports' link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\"\n- Before commit: 78daa0a\n- Old test spec SidebarNavigation lists \"Reports\" as a nav link\n- CLP-NAV-02 test says: \"Clicking 'Clients' navigates to /clients, verifying the URL\" — but doesn't test Reports navigation target\n\n**Bug 3: Settings button does nothing**\n- \"'Settings' button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\"\n- Before commit: 78daa0a\n- Old test spec lists Settings as a nav link but no test entry covers clicking Settings\n\n**Bug 4: Deals dropdown styling**\n- \"On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\"\n- Before commit: 0cd095c\n- This is a styling/UI issue with native `<select>` elements\n\n**Bug 5: Attachment preview**\n- \"Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\"\n- Before commit: 0301f38 \n- This is about the visual presentation of attachments\n\n**Bug 6: Task detail page**\n- \"Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\"\n- Before commit: fc47dd2\n- This is entirely new functionality - no task detail page existed before\n\nPlease run these git commands to verify the old test spec content:\n1. `git show 78daa0a:apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md | grep -n \"CLP-NAV\\|Dashboard\\|Reports\\|Settings\\|SidebarNavigation\" | head -30`\n2. `git show 0301f38:apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md | grep -n \"attachment\\|preview\\|thumbnail\\|CDP-ATT\\|DDP-ATT\" -i | head -20`\n3. `git show fc47dd2:apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md | grep -n \"task detail\\|TaskDetail\\|TDP\" -i | head -10`\n\nThen for each bug, provide:\n- Bug description (short)\n- Classification reasoning\n- Problem stage (writeApp.md, testSpec.md, writeTests.md, or \"none\")\n\nFormat the results clearly so I can update bugReports.md and plan.md."}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_012CVLHmmfigtFhjfcyv3CNA","session_id":"1b3cdbe8-d256-4cc5-8532-0000270df63f","uuid":"2ca6f8be-e68a-4e38-a4f4-ead0fe891e82"}

Here are the results:\n\n---\n\n## Bug Classification Results\n\n### Bug 1: Dashboard/Clients duplicate highlight\n- **Description:** On the clients page, both \"Dashboard\" and \"Clients\" are highlighted in the sidebar. Dashboard link should be removed.\n- **Reasoning:** This is a UI/style issue -- a duplicate visual highlight in the navigation sidebar. The rule says: if the bug is about style/UI, the problem stage is `writeApp.md`.\n- **Problem stage: `writeApp.md`**\n\n---\n\n### Bug 2: Reports link 404\n- **Description:** The \"Reports\" link in the sidebar navigates to a 404 page. All links must go to valid locations.\n- **Reasoning:** This is a functional problem. Checking the old test spec at `78daa0a`:\n  - `CLP-NAV-01` specifies the sidebar should show \"Dashboard, Clients, Deals, Tasks, Reports, Settings\" -- so Reports is listed as a navigation link.\n  - `CLP-NAV-02` only tests routing for Deals, Tasks, and Clients. It says **nothing** about where Reports should route to.\n  - The spec acknowledges Reports exists as a link (existing functionality) but no test entry covers its navigation target. Per rule 2c: existing functionality with no test coverage means the problem stage is `testSpec.md`.\n- **Problem stage: `testSpec.md`**\n\n---\n\n### Bug 3: Settings button does nothing\n- **Description:** The \"Settings\" button in the lower left of the sidebar does nothing when clicked. All enabled buttons must do something.\n- **Reasoning:** This is a functional problem. Checking the old test spec at `78daa0a`:\n  - The SidebarNavigation component description lists \"Settings\" as a nav link and mentions a \"bottom Settings link.\"\n  - `CLP-NAV-01` lists Settings in the expected sidebar links.\n  - `CLP-NAV-02` only tests Deals, Tasks, and Clients routing -- no test entry covers clicking Settings.\n  - Same as Bug 2: Settings is listed as existing functionality but no test entry covers its click behavior. Per rule 2c: existing functionality, no test coverage means `testSpec.md`.\n- **Problem stage: `testSpec.md`**\n\n---\n\n### Bug 4: Deals dropdown styling\n- **Description:** On the deals page, dropdowns revert to browser default styling when clicked. They should maintain custom styling.\n- **Reasoning:** This is explicitly a styling/UI issue -- native `<select>` elements losing custom styling on interaction. Per rule 1: style/UI bugs go to `writeApp.md`.\n- **Problem stage: `writeApp.md`**\n\n---\n\n### Bug 5: Attachment preview\n- **Description:** Attachments on the clients page should show a preview with file type and thumbnail for images.\n- **Reasoning:** This is a style/UI issue -- it is about the visual presentation of attachments (showing previews/thumbnails). The old test spec at `0301f38` describes attachments as showing \"file icon, filename, type (Document/Link), created date, linked deal name, and action icons\" -- it says nothing about previews or thumbnails. However, since the bug is fundamentally about how attachments **look** (visual presentation, thumbnails, previews), it falls under the style/UI rule. Per rule 1: style/UI bugs go to `writeApp.md`.\n- **Problem stage: `writeApp.md`**\n\n---\n\n### Bug 6: Task detail page\n- **Description:** Add a task detail page with all pertinent information and the ability to mark tasks completed/canceled or add notes.\n- **Reasoning:** This is a functional request. Checking the old test spec at `fc47dd2`:\n  - There is **no** `TaskDetailPage` section anywhere in the test spec (the grep returned empty).\n  - References to \"task detail\" are vague: \"shows task detail inline or in a modal\" -- but no dedicated page is specified.\n  - This is asking for entirely **new functionality** -- a new page that did not exist before.

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)` —\n  it is not supported and will silently fail or return incorrect results. For dynamic WHERE clauses,\n  build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n","numLines":72,"startLine":1,"totalLines":72}}}

Add the following subtasks\nfor every page in the app:\n\n- CheckTestSpec<PageName>: Check for `testSpec.md` directive violations in the test entries for the page.\n- CheckComponents<PageName>: Check for `writeApp.md` directive violations in the components for the page.\n- CheckTests<PageName>: Check for `writeTests.md` directive violations in the playwright tests for\n  each of the page's test entries.\n\nAlso add additional non-page specific subtasks:\n\n- CheckBackend: Check for `writeApp.md` directive violations in all backend functions.\n\n## Checking for violations\n\nDuring each checking task you need to read the strategy document and all the directives,\nand then go through all the documentation / code you are checking to look for violations of those directives.\nYou must do this systematically and announce each entry name / file you are checking.\n\nFor any violations you find, add the following pending tasks to `docs/plan.md`. Do not fix them immediately.\n\n1. FixViolation: Fix the directive violation.\n2. RunTests: Make sure tests are passing.\n3. DocumentFix: Document the fix appropriately.\n\nAdd a pending task to fix any violations you find. Do not fix them immediately.\n\n## Fixing violations\n\nFix the relevant documentation / code to make sure it is not violating the directives.\nMake sure to update anything else affected by the changes you are making, in `docs/tests.md`, the app code,\nand playwright tests.\n\n## Running tests\n\nMake sure all tests pass. Read `testing.md` to understand how to run tests and debug failures.\n\n## Documenting fixes\n\nUpdate the section for the current round of maintenance in `docs/plan.md`\nwith a note about the fix you performed.\n\nCommit all changes and exit.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When fixing violations, commit after each logical group of fixes (e.g. all SQL fixes together,\n  all data-testid fixes together) rather than trying to fix everything in one pass. The performTasks\n  strategy requires exiting after commits, and attempting to fix all violations without committing\n  leads to unproductive iterations with zero commits.\n- Group related fix tasks into a single FixViolation task when they share the same root cause\n  (e.g. \"FixViolationMissingTestIds\" for all modals missing data-testid attributes).\n","numLines":60,"startLine":1,"totalLines":60}}}
