## Strategy Instructions

### buildInitialApp.md

# Strategy

You are building an application based on the provided AppSpec.md.
You will build the app in the following stages, with strategy files to additional instructions.

1. testSpec.md: Create a detailed test specification for the tests the app must pass in order to match the app spec.

2. writeApp.md: Write the app's code according to the two specs.

3. writeTests.md: Write the tests according to the two specs.

4. testing.md: Get all tests to pass, debugging and fixing the app / tests as needed.

5. deployment.md: Deploy the app to production.

## Development Process

ULTRA IMPORTANT: Follow these directions exactly.

1. Look for files `logs/iteration-...` describing recent changes made. While there are any,
   follow instructions from this file to process them
   reviewChanges.md
2. Read `docs/plan.md` (if it exists) to understand current progress. If there is no plan, create the file with one "Unpack Subtasks" task for each stage.
3. Pick the next task and announce `IMPLEMENT: <TaskName>`.
4. Read the instructions for the associated stage (if you haven't already) and implement the task.
5. After every significant change or when the task requires it, run typecheck and lint, fix any errors, then commit.
6. Update `docs/plan.md` to reflect progress.
7. If any changes were committed, you ABSOLUTELY MUST IMMEDIATELY EXIT. You will restart afterwards with a fresh context.

## Required Environment Variables

```
NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN
NEON_API_KEY
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN
RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY
```

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** for build tooling
- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)
- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)
- **Redux** for client side state management
- **shadcn/ui** for components
- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).
- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.
- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.

## Database

The app must support `npm run init-db` which creates a new Neon database and configures the app to connect to it. This should read NEON_API_KEY from the environment. Use this database for all testing, do not set up a local copy of anything or any proxies.

All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific frontend components.

## Quality Gates

Before each commit:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass with no errors
- `npx eslint .` must pass with no errors

Do not commit code that fails typecheck or lint.

## Documentation

Maintain `docs/plan.md` with:
- High-level app structure and architecture
- Feature breakdown with status (done / in progress / todo)
- Any blockers or decisions made
- Pending and completed tasks. All tasks must be of the form "TaskName: Description"

## Commits

- Commit after every significant change (new feature, bug fix, refactor).
- Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.
- Never commit code that fails typecheck or lint.

## Instructions

Pick an unfinished task and start working on it.

Focus on one task at a time. Do it well rather than rushing through multiple tasks. If the task is associated with one of the stages of app development, read the additional instructions for that stage from the files listed above.

When you finish a task, mark it completed in the plan. Your work is not finished until all remaining tasks are addressed.

Describe your thoughts in detail when writing code or specs and using tools.

## Instructions

Follow the strategy instructions above. Work on the target repository.
When all work described in the strategy is complete, include `<DONE/>` in your response.
If more work remains, describe what was accomplished and what still needs to be done.

IMPORTANT: Monitor your context window usage. When you are running low on context,
wrap up your current task cleanly — commit your work, update docs/plan.md, and exit.
The next iteration of the loop will pick up where you left off with fresh context.

You will restart afterwards with a fresh context.\n\n## Required Environment Variables\n\n```\nNETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG\nNETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN\nNEON_API_KEY\nUPLOADTHING_TOKEN\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nThe app must support `npm run init-db` which creates a new Neon database and configures the app to connect to it. This should read NEON_API_KEY from the environment. Use this database for all testing, do not set up a local copy of anything or any proxies.\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific frontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit:\n- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass with no errors\n- `npx eslint .` must pass with no errors\n\nDo not commit code that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Documentation\n\nMaintain `docs/plan.md` with:\n- High-level app structure and architecture\n- Feature breakdown with status (done / in progress / todo)\n- Any blockers or decisions made\n- Pending and completed tasks. All tasks must be of the form \"TaskName: Description\"\n\n## Commits\n\n- Commit after every significant change (new feature, bug fix, refactor).\n- Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.\n- Never commit code that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Instructions\n\nPick an unfinished task and start working on it.\n\nFocus on one task at a time. Do it well rather than rushing through multiple tasks. If the task is associated with one of the stages of app development, read the additional instructions for that stage from the files listed above.\n\nWhen you finish a task, mark it completed in the plan. Your work is not finished until all remaining tasks are addressed.\n\nDescribe your thoughts in detail when writing code or specs and using tools.\n\n\n## Current Repository Context\n\n## AppSpec.md\n\nApp: Sales CRM\nInitial Prompt: Basic CRM for tracking relationships with existing clients and prospects.  data structure:\n\nClient (org or individual)\n> source info\n> tags\n> next tasks / task history (can be associated with a deal)\n> attachments (can be associated with a deal)\n> individuals associated with the client\n>> relationships with other individuals\n>> history of contact with this individual\n> current status (active / inactive / prospect / churned)\n> deals\n>> deal stage / history\n>> writeups\n\n\nPages:\n\n1.

Needs full build-out\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Available Deal Components** (11 components in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/`)\n\n| Component | Purpose | Status |\n|-----------|---------|--------|\n| `DealsPageHeader.tsx` | Search bar + Create Deal button | Implemented |\n| `DealsSummaryCards.tsx` | KPI cards (Active deals, Pipeline value, Won, Lost) | Implemented |\n| `DealsViewToggle.tsx` | Table/Pipeline view switcher | Implemented |\n| `DealsFilterControls.tsx` | Filters (stage, client, status, sort, date range) | Implemented |\n| `DealStatusBadge.tsx` | Status indicator badges | Implemented |\n| `DealStageBadge.tsx` | Deal stage badges (Lead, Qualification, etc.) | Implemented |\n| `DealRowActionMenu.tsx` | Action menu (View, Edit, Delete) with navigation to detail page | Implemented |\n| `DealsTable.tsx` | Main table display for deals list | Implemented |\n| `DealsPipelineView.tsx` | Kanban pipeline view (6 columns by stage) | Implemented |\n| `DealsPagination.tsx` | Pagination controls | Implemented |\n| `CreateDealModal.tsx` | Modal for creating new deals | Implemented |\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Backend API** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/deals.ts`)\n\n**Endpoints:**\n- `GET /deals` - List deals with filters, pagination, metrics, and client list\n- `GET /deals/:dealId` - Get single deal with client name\n- `POST /deals` - Create new deal with history and timeline tracking\n- `PUT /deals/:dealId` - Update deal (with stage change history)\n- `DELETE /deals/:dealId` - Delete deal\n\n**Features:**\n- Supports filtering by: search, stage, client, status, date range\n- Sorting options: close_date (asc/desc), name (asc/desc), value (asc/desc)\n- Pagination with configurable page size\n- Automatic deal history tracking for stage changes\n- Timeline event creation for deal creation and stage changes\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Redux Store** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/dealsSlice.ts`)\n\n**State Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface DealsState {\n  items: Deal[]              // List of deals\n  currentDeal: Deal | null   // Single deal for detail view\n  loading: boolean\n  error: string | null\n  total: number              // Total deals (for pagination)\n  page: number\n  pageSize: number\n  metrics: DealMetrics       // Summary metrics\n  availableClients: ClientOption[]\n}\n```\n\n**Async Thunks:**\n- `fetchDeals(params)` - List deals with filtering\n- `fetchDeal(dealId)` - Fetch single deal\n- `createDeal(data)` - Create new deal\n- `deleteDeal(dealId)` - Delete deal\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Types** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts`)\n\n```typescript\n// Deal type\ninterface Deal {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  client_id: string\n  client_name: string\n  value: number\n  stage: DealStage\n  status: string\n  owner: string\n  probability: number\n  expected_close_date: string | null\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n}\n\n// Deal stages\ntype DealStage = 'lead' | 'qualification' | 'discovery' | 'proposal' | 'negotiation' | 'closed_won' | 'closed_lost'\n```\n\nAlso includes related types: `DealHistory`, `Writeup`, `DealContact`, and more.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Design Style Reference** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppStyle.md`)\n\n**Key Design Tokens:**\n- **Primary accent color:** `#7180ff` (purple/blue)\n- **Font stack:** Inter Variable\n- **Button sizes:** 28px height (standard)\n- **Border radius:** 4px (controls), 6px (cards), 8px (modals)\n- **Shadows:** Very subtle (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1))\n- **Hover state:** ~6% black overlay (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`)\n- **Layout:** Grid-based with semantic columns\n\n**Text Colors:**\n- Primary: `#1a1a1a` (dark gray)\n- Secondary: `#2d2e2f`\n- Muted: `#59595a`\n- Disabled: `#b0b5c0`\n\n---\n\n## Key Observations for DealDetailPage Development:\n\n1. **All supporting components are ready** - The deals list has complete infrastructure\n2. **Redux store can fetch individual deals** - `fetchDeal(dealId)` thunk exists\n3. **Backend supports full CRUD** - PUT endpoint supports updates\n4. **Navigation pattern established** - `DealRowActionMenu` navigates to `/deals/:dealId`\n5. **UI patterns consistent** - Use Linear-inspired design tokens from AppStyle.md\n6. **Possible deal detail sections:**\n   - Deal information panel (name, client, value, stage, owner)\n   - Stage/status indicators\n   - Timeline/history section\n   - Related contacts/individuals section\n   - Attachments section\n   - Notes/writeups section\n   - Action buttons (edit, delete, etc.)\n\nAll file contents are fully provided above for reference in implementing the DealDetailPage."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: aa10aaa (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 41939\ntool_uses: 17\nduration_ms: 21653</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c0ee9813-2fe0-4fe8-82db-48d9bffde282","uuid":"0f12bf75-f83a-42e2-b549-d02d5df2a031","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the current state of the DealDetailPage implementation in /repo/apps/SalesCRM.

The outer container (`.ezxFuW`) is a single-column grid where each child is a full-width row.\n\n```css\n/* Outer list container */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* single column, full-width rows */\ngrid-template-rows: 36px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 308px;\n                  /* ^group header  ^issue rows...                              ^spacer */\n```\n\n- **Group header row**: 36px tall\n- **Issue row**: 44px tall\n- The list container has 14 children: 1 group header + 12 issue rows + 1 spacer\n\n### Issue Row Structure\n\nEach issue row is an `<a>` tag (the full row is clickable) wrapping an inner grid `<div>` with **7 named grid columns**:\n\n| Column       | Content Example          | Font Size | Font Weight | Color             |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `checkbox`   | (empty/checkbox)         | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `priority`   | (priority icon)          | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `identifier` | \"PRO-1247\", \"TT-38\"     | 13px      | 450         | rgb(91, 91, 93)   |\n| `status`     | (status icon)            | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `title`      | \"Contact form not working\" | 13px    | 500         | rgb(26, 26, 26)   |\n| `created`    | (date/avatar info)       | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n| (additional) | (assignee, labels, etc.) | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n\nKey observations:\n- **Identifier** uses muted color `rgb(91, 91, 93)` / `#5b5b5d` with semi-bold weight 450\n- **Title** uses primary color `rgb(26, 26, 26)` / `#1a1a1a` with medium weight 500\n- Both use 13px font size (not the body 16px)\n- The grid uses **named column tracks** (`checkbox`, `priority`, `identifier`, `status`, `title`, `created`) for semantic column placement\n\n### Issue Row Styling\n\n```css\n/* Issue row (A tag) */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-column: 1 / -1;      /* spans full width */\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 44px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nborder: none;              /* 0px none — no visible row borders */\ncursor: default;\ntext-decoration: none;     /* no underline on the link */\noutline: none;             /* focus-visible override */\n```\n\n### Row Separation\n\nRows have **no visible borders** between them. Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nfont-size: 16px;\nfont-weight: 400;\n```\n\nGroup headers contain section names (e.g., \"Other active\") with a count badge (\"19\").\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —         |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`  | ~6% black |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(239, 239, 239)`     | `#efefef` |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(245, 245, 245)`     | `#f5f5f5` |\n| Alt hover (mid)   | `rgb(247, 247, 247)`     | `#f7f7f7` |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(237, 237, 237)`     | `#ededed` |\n\nAll hover backgrounds observed in stylesheets:\n- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)` — primary interactive hover\n- `rgb(239, 239, 239)` — pressed/active\n- `rgb(245, 245, 245)` — sidebar hover\n- `rgb(247, 247, 247)` — light hover\n- `rgb(237, 237, 237)` — selected state\n- `transparent` — reset/clear hover\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: var(--control-border-radius, 4px);\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(45, 46, 47);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background         | Description                |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Default | transparent        | No background              |\n| Hover   | rgb(247, 247, 247) | `#f7f7f7` — subtle gray    |\n| Active  | rgb(238, 238, 238) | `#eeeeee` — slightly darker|\n\nThe hover transition uses `var(--speed-highlightFadeIn)` for a fast, smooth appearance.\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n| `1px solid var(--gray4)`             | Subtle separators        |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#dcdcdc`.\nHover border uses `var(--normal-border-hover)` and `var(--gray5)` for a slightly darker state.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value                              | Usage                     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| `var(--control-border-radius)` 4px | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px                                | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px                                | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%                                | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows are very subtle and use low-opacity black.
