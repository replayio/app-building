## Strategy Instructions

### buildInitialApp.md

# Strategy

You are building an application based on the provided AppSpec.md.
You will build the app in the following stages, with strategy files to additional instructions.

1. testSpec.md: Create a detailed test specification for the tests the app must pass in order to match the app spec.

2. writeApp.md: Write the app's code according to the two specs.

3. writeTests.md: Write the tests according to the two specs.

4. testing.md: Get all tests to pass, debugging and fixing the app / tests as needed.

5. deployment.md: Deploy the app to production.

## Development Process

ULTRA IMPORTANT: Follow these directions exactly.

1. Look for files `logs/iteration-...` describing recent changes made. While there are any,
   follow instructions from this file to process them
   reviewChanges.md
2. Read `docs/plan.md` (if it exists) to understand current progress. If there is no plan, create the file with one "Unpack Subtasks" task for each stage.
3. Pick the next task and announce `IMPLEMENT: <TaskName>`.
4. Read the instructions for the associated stage (if you haven't already) and implement the task.
5. After every significant change or when the task requires it, run typecheck and lint, fix any errors, then commit.
6. Update `docs/plan.md` to reflect progress.
7. If any changes were committed, you ABSOLUTELY MUST IMMEDIATELY EXIT. You will restart afterwards with a fresh context.

## Required Environment Variables

```
NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN
NEON_API_KEY
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN
RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY
```

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** for build tooling
- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)
- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)
- **Redux** for client side state management
- **shadcn/ui** for components
- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).
- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.
- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.

## Database

The app must support `npm run init-db` which creates a new Neon database and configures the app to connect to it. This should read NEON_API_KEY from the environment. Use this database for all testing, do not set up a local copy of anything or any proxies.

All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific frontend components.

## Quality Gates

Before each commit:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass with no errors
- `npx eslint .` must pass with no errors

Do not commit code that fails typecheck or lint.

## Documentation

Maintain `docs/plan.md` with:
- High-level app structure and architecture
- Feature breakdown with status (done / in progress / todo)
- Any blockers or decisions made
- Pending and completed tasks. All tasks must be of the form "TaskName: Description"

## Commits

- Commit after every significant change (new feature, bug fix, refactor).
- Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.
- Never commit code that fails typecheck or lint.

## Instructions

Pick an unfinished task and start working on it.

Focus on one task at a time. Do it well rather than rushing through multiple tasks. If the task is associated with one of the stages of app development, read the additional instructions for that stage from the files listed above.

When you finish a task, mark it completed in the plan. Your work is not finished until all remaining tasks are addressed.

Describe your thoughts in detail when writing code or specs and using tools.

Look for files `logs/iteration-...` describing recent changes made. While there are any,\n   follow instructions from this file to process them\n   reviewChanges.md\n2. Read `docs/plan.md` (if it exists) to understand current progress. If there is no plan, create the file with one \"Unpack Subtasks\" task for each stage.\n3. Pick the next task and announce `IMPLEMENT: <TaskName>`.\n4. Read the instructions for the associated stage (if you haven't already) and implement the task.\n5. After every significant change or when the task requires it, run typecheck and lint, fix any errors, then commit.\n6. Update `docs/plan.md` to reflect progress.\n7. If any changes were committed, you ABSOLUTELY MUST IMMEDIATELY EXIT. You will restart afterwards with a fresh context.\n\n## Required Environment Variables\n\n```\nNETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG\nNETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN\nNEON_API_KEY\nUPLOADTHING_TOKEN\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nThe app must support `npm run init-db` which creates a new Neon database and configures the app to connect to it. This should read NEON_API_KEY from the environment. Use this database for all testing, do not set up a local copy of anything or any proxies.\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific frontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit:\n- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass with no errors\n- `npx eslint .` must pass with no errors\n\nDo not commit code that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Documentation\n\nMaintain `docs/plan.md` with:\n- High-level app structure and architecture\n- Feature breakdown with status (done / in progress / todo)\n- Any blockers or decisions made\n- Pending and completed tasks. All tasks must be of the form \"TaskName: Description\"\n\n## Commits\n\n- Commit after every significant change (new feature, bug fix, refactor).\n- Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.\n- Never commit code that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Instructions\n\nPick an unfinished task and start working on it.\n\nFocus on one task at a time. Do it well rather than rushing through multiple tasks. If the task is associated with one of the stages of app development, read the additional instructions for that stage from the files listed above.\n\nWhen you finish a task, mark it completed in the plan. Your work is not finished until all remaining tasks are addressed.\n\nDescribe your thoughts in detail when writing code or specs and using tools.\n\n\n## Current Repository Context\n\n## AppSpec.md\n\nApp: Sales CRM\nInitial Prompt: Basic CRM for tracking relationships with existing clients and prospects.  data structure:\n\nClient (org or individual)\n> source info\n> tags\n> next tasks / task history (can be associated with a deal)\n> attachments (can be associated with a deal)\n> individuals associated with the client\n>> relationships with other individuals\n>> history of contact with this individual\n> current status (active / inactive / prospect / churned)\n> deals\n>> deal stage / history\n>> writeups\n\n\nPages:\n\n1.

Types (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts)\n\n**Type Definitions:**\n- `ClientStatus` - 'active' | 'inactive' | 'prospect' | 'churned'\n- `ClientType` - 'organization' | 'individual'\n- `DealStage` - 'lead' | 'qualification' | 'discovery' | 'proposal' | 'negotiation' | 'closed_won' | 'closed_lost'\n- `TaskPriority` - 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' | 'normal'\n- `AttachmentType` - 'document' | 'link'\n- `ContactHistoryType` - 'email' | 'phone_call' | 'video_call' | 'meeting' | 'note'\n- `RelationshipType` - 'colleague' | 'decision_maker' | 'influencer' | 'manager' | 'report' | 'other'\n\n**Interfaces Defined:**\n- `Client` - Core client entity with id, name, type, status, tags, source info, campaign, channel, dates, primary contact info, open deals count/value, and next task details\n- `Deal` - Sales deal with id, name, client_id/name, value, stage, status, owner, probability, expected close date\n- `Task` - Task entity with id, title, description, due_date, priority, completed status, client/deal associations, assignee info\n- `Individual` - Person entity with id, name, title, email, phone, location, plus client associations, relationships, and contact history\n- `ClientAssociation` - Link between individual and client with role and industry\n- `Relationship` - Inter-personal relationships with type and company info\n- `ContactHistoryEntry` - Record of contact interactions (email, phone, video, meeting, note)\n- `Attachment` - File/link attachments associated with clients or deals\n- `TimelineEvent` - Activity timeline entries for a client\n- `DealHistory` - Audit trail of deal stage changes\n- `Writeup` - Versioned deal writeups/notes\n- `DealContact` - Contact associated with a deal\n\n---\n\n### 2. Store Configuration (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/index.ts)\n\n**Redux Store Structure:**\n```\n{\n  clients: ClientsState,\n  deals: DealsState,\n  tasks: TasksState,\n  individuals: IndividualsState\n}\n```\n\n**Types Exported:**\n- `RootState` - Complete Redux state shape\n- `AppDispatch` - Typed dispatch function\n\n---\n\n### 3. Clients Slice (/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/clientsSlice.ts)\n\n**ClientsState Shape:**\n```typescript\n{\n  items: Client[]              // List of all clients\n  currentClient: Client | null // Selected client detail\n  loading: boolean             // Async operation in progress\n  error: string | null         // Error message if any\n  total: number                // Total count for pagination\n  page: number                 // Current page (default: 1)\n  pageSize: number             // Items per page (default: 50)\n  availableTags: string[]      // Filter options\n  availableSources: string[]   // Filter options\n}\n```\n\n**Async Thunks:**\n1. `fetchClients` - GET `/.netlify/functions/clients`\n   - Parameters: page, search, status, tag, source, sort\n   - Returns: { clients[], total, tags[], sources[] }\n\n2. `fetchClient` - GET `/.netlify/functions/clients/{clientId}`\n   - Parameter: clientId\n   - Returns: Client\n\n3. `createClient` - POST `/.netlify/functions/clients`\n   - Body: name, type, status?, tags?, source_type?, source_detail?, campaign?, channel?, date_acquired?\n   - Returns: Client\n\n4. `updateClient` - PUT `/.netlify/functions/clients/{clientId}`\n   - Parameters: clientId, data (Record<string, unknown>)\n   - Returns: Client\n\n5. `deleteClient` - DELETE `/.netlify/functions/clients/{clientId}`\n   - Parameter: clientId\n   - Returns: clientId\n\n**Synchronous Reducers:**\n- `setPage(state, action)` - Updates the page number\n\n**State Updates (extraReducers):**\n- Manages loading/error states for all async thunks\n- Updates items list on create/update/delete\n- Updates currentClient on fetch operations\n- Maintains pagination and filter metadata\n\n---\n\n### 4.
