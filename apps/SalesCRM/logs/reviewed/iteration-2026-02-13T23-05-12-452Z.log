## Strategy Instructions

### buildInitialApp.md

# Strategy

You are building an application based on the provided AppSpec.md.
You will build the app in the following stages, with strategy files to additional instructions.

1. testSpec.md: Create a detailed test specification for the tests the app must pass in order to match the app spec.

2. writeApp.md: Write the app's code according to the two specs.

3. writeTests.md: Write the tests according to the two specs.

4. testing.md: Get all tests to pass, debugging and fixing the app / tests as needed.

5. deployment.md: Deploy the app to production.

## Development Process

ULTRA IMPORTANT: Follow these directions exactly.

1. Look for files `logs/iteration-...` describing recent changes made. While there are any,
   follow instructions from this file to process them
   reviewChanges.md
2. Read `docs/plan.md` (if it exists) to understand current progress. If there is no plan, create the file with one "Unpack Subtasks" task for each stage.
3. Pick the next task and announce `IMPLEMENT: <TaskName>`.
4. Read the instructions for the associated stage (if you haven't already) and implement the task.
5. After every significant change or when the task requires it, run typecheck and lint, fix any errors, then commit.
6. Update `docs/plan.md` to reflect progress.
7. If any changes were committed, you ABSOLUTELY MUST IMMEDIATELY EXIT. You will restart afterwards with a fresh context.

## Required Environment Variables

```
NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN
NEON_API_KEY
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN
RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY
```

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** for build tooling
- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)
- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)
- **Redux** for client side state management
- **shadcn/ui** for components
- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).
- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.
- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.

## Database

The app must support `npm run init-db` which creates a new Neon database and configures the app to connect to it. This should read NEON_API_KEY from the environment. Use this database for all testing, do not set up a local copy of anything or any proxies.

All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific frontend components.

## Quality Gates

Before each commit:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass with no errors
- `npx eslint .` must pass with no errors

Do not commit code that fails typecheck or lint.

## Documentation

Maintain `docs/plan.md` with:
- High-level app structure and architecture
- Feature breakdown with status (done / in progress / todo)
- Any blockers or decisions made
- Pending and completed tasks. All tasks must be of the form "TaskName: Description"

## Commits

- Commit after every significant change (new feature, bug fix, refactor).
- Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.
- Never commit code that fails typecheck or lint.

## Instructions

Pick an unfinished task and start working on it.

Focus on one task at a time. Do it well rather than rushing through multiple tasks. If the task is associated with one of the stages of app development, read the additional instructions for that stage from the files listed above.

When you finish a task, mark it completed in the plan. Your work is not finished until all remaining tasks are addressed.

Describe your thoughts in detail when writing code or specs and using tools.

Look for files `logs/iteration-...` describing recent changes made. While there are any,\n   follow instructions from this file to process them\n   reviewChanges.md\n2. Read `docs/plan.md` (if it exists) to understand current progress. If there is no plan, create the file with one \"Unpack Subtasks\" task for each stage.\n3. Pick the next task and announce `IMPLEMENT: <TaskName>`.\n4. Read the instructions for the associated stage (if you haven't already) and implement the task.\n5. After every significant change or when the task requires it, run typecheck and lint, fix any errors, then commit.\n6. Update `docs/plan.md` to reflect progress.\n7. If any changes were committed, you ABSOLUTELY MUST IMMEDIATELY EXIT. You will restart afterwards with a fresh context.\n\n## Required Environment Variables\n\n```\nNETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG\nNETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN\nNEON_API_KEY\nUPLOADTHING_TOKEN\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nThe app must support `npm run init-db` which creates a new Neon database and configures the app to connect to it. This should read NEON_API_KEY from the environment. Use this database for all testing, do not set up a local copy of anything or any proxies.\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific frontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit:\n- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass with no errors\n- `npx eslint .` must pass with no errors\n\nDo not commit code that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Documentation\n\nMaintain `docs/plan.md` with:\n- High-level app structure and architecture\n- Feature breakdown with status (done / in progress / todo)\n- Any blockers or decisions made\n- Pending and completed tasks. All tasks must be of the form \"TaskName: Description\"\n\n## Commits\n\n- Commit after every significant change (new feature, bug fix, refactor).\n- Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.\n- Never commit code that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Instructions\n\nPick an unfinished task and start working on it.\n\nFocus on one task at a time. Do it well rather than rushing through multiple tasks. If the task is associated with one of the stages of app development, read the additional instructions for that stage from the files listed above.\n\nWhen you finish a task, mark it completed in the plan. Your work is not finished until all remaining tasks are addressed.\n\nDescribe your thoughts in detail when writing code or specs and using tools.\n\n\n## Current Repository Context\n\n## AppSpec.md\n\nApp: Sales CRM\nInitial Prompt: Basic CRM for tracking relationships with existing clients and prospects.  data structure:\n\nClient (org or individual)\n> source info\n> tags\n> next tasks / task history (can be associated with a deal)\n> attachments (can be associated with a deal)\n> individuals associated with the client\n>> relationships with other individuals\n>> history of contact with this individual\n> current status (active / inactive / prospect / churned)\n> deals\n>> deal stage / history\n>> writeups\n\n\nPages:\n\n1.

Let me create a comprehensive review report.\n\n## PersonDetailPage Code Quality Review\n\nBased on my thorough review of the implementation, here are the code quality issues found:\n\n### 1. MISSING FUNCTIONALITY - Critical Issues\n\n**A. AddRelationshipModal lacks person search/lookup**\n   - File: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/AddRelationshipModal.tsx` (lines 50-58)\n   - Issue: Modal asks user to enter \"Person ID\" as plain text, but there's no search/autocomplete functionality or UI guidance\n   - Problem: Users must already know the exact ID, making it unusable in real scenarios\n   - Spec requirement: Should allow selecting from available individuals\n\n**B. Delete functionality not implemented**\n   - Files: PersonDetailPage.tsx, RelationshipsSection.tsx, ContactHistorySection.tsx\n   - Issue: Backend supports DELETE for relationships (line 154-157 in individuals.ts) and contact history (lines 205-208), but UI has no delete buttons\n   - Spec requirement: Contact history should be editable (add/edit implemented) and should include delete\n   - Missing handlers: `handleDeleteRelationship()`, `handleDeleteContactHistory()`\n   - Missing UI: Delete buttons with confirmation in list views\n\n**C. No error handling or user feedback**\n   - File: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/PersonDetailPage.tsx` (lines 34-83)\n   - Issue: All fetch operations ignore errors silently; no toast notifications or error messages\n   - Problem: If add/edit/update operations fail, user gets no feedback\n   - Backend can return 404 errors but frontend never handles them\n\n**D. Contact history and relationships cannot be deleted**\n   - Files: RelationshipsSection.tsx and ContactHistorySection.tsx\n   - Issue: List views show data but have no delete/remove actions despite backend support\n\n---\n\n### 2. MISSING FEATURES FROM SPEC\n\n**A. Breadcrumb navigation issue**\n   - File: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/PersonDetailPage.tsx` (lines 96-107)\n   - Issue: Breadcrumb shows \"Clients > Individuals > [Name]\" but there's no actual \"/individuals\" list page in the app\n   - Spec requirement: PersonDetailPage \"May be reached from a client or from a global people listing\"\n   - Current: There's no global people listing page\n   - The breadcrumb is misleading since clicking \"Clients\" sends you to `/clients`, not a people listing\n\n**B. Graph view in RelationshipsSection appears incomplete**\n   - File: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/RelationshipsSection.tsx` (lines 142-204)\n   - Issue: Graph shows hardcoded \"You\" label instead of actual person's name\n   - Problem: SVG connection lines use hardcoded colors (`#dcdcdc`) instead of CSS variables\n   - Missing: No styling consistency with the design system (should use `border-border` color)\n\n---\n\n### 3. CODE QUALITY ISSUES\n\n**A. Inline JSX complexity should be abstracted**\n   - Files: Multiple components have repetitive patterns\n   \n   RelationshipsSection.tsx:\n   - Filter dropdown UI (lines 40-66) is repeated nearly identically in ContactHistorySection\n   - View toggle tabs (lines 79-100) are UI patterns that should be a shared component\n   \n   PersonHeader.tsx:\n   - Edit form fields (lines 64-114) with labels and inputs are verbose; could use a reusable form field component\n   \n   Suggested abstractions:\n   - `<FilterDropdown />` component (used in both Relationships and ContactHistory)\n   - `<ViewToggleTabs />` component \n   - `<FormField />` component for edit forms\n\n**B. Repeated TYPE_LABELS/TYPE_OPTIONS**\n   - ContactHistoryType labels defined identically in:\n     - AddContactHistoryModal.tsx (lines 11-17)\n     - EditContactHistoryModal.tsx (lines 11-17)\n     - ContactHistorySection.tsx (lines 11-17)\n   - Should be centralized in a constants file\n\n**C. Date formatting is duplicated**\n   - ContactHistorySection.tsx defines `formatDate()` (lines 19-28)\n   - EditContactHistoryModal.tsx defines `toDatetimeLocal()` (lines 19-23)\n   - These should be shared utilities\n\n---\n\n### 4. BACKEND API COMPLETENESS\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/individuals.ts`**\n\nStatus: Backend is well-implemented with all required operations:\n\nSupported endpoints:\n- GET /individuals/:id (lines 58-106) - Full data fetch with associations, relationships, and history\n- PUT /individuals/:id (lines 108-135) - Update individual info\n- POST /individuals/:id/relationships (lines 137-151) - Add relationship\n- DELETE /individuals/:id/relationships/:relId (lines 153-157) - Delete relationship\n- POST /individuals/:id/contact-history (lines 159-175) - Add contact history\n- PUT /individuals/:id/contact-history/:entryId (lines 177-202) - Edit contact history\n- DELETE /individuals/:id/contact-history/:entryId (lines 204-208) - Delete contact history\n\nIssue: Frontend doesn't utilize DELETE endpoints even though they're available.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EDGE CASES & POTENTIAL BUGS\n\n**A. Modal form state not reset on error**\n   - Files: AddContactHistoryModal.tsx (lines 35-38), AddRelationshipModal.tsx (lines 32-33)\n   - Issue: Forms clear state on successful save, but if save fails silently, state persists incorrectly on reopen\n   - Should only clear on success with confirmation, or reset on open\n\n**B. Empty state copy inconsistency**\n   - RelationshipsSection.tsx (line 105): \"No relationships found\"\n   - ContactHistorySection.tsx (line 87): \"No contact history found\"\n   - AssociatedClientsSection.tsx (line 31): \"No associated clients\"\n   - Inconsistent terminology; should be standardized\n\n**C. ContactHistoryEntry.individual_id never used**\n   - File: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts` (line 96)\n   - ContactHistoryEntry includes `individual_id` but it's already associated with an individual via URL context\n   - Not used anywhere in component logic; potential dead property\n\n**D. Missing null check for currentIndividual post-loading**\n   - PersonDetailPage.tsx (line 85): Returns \"Loading...\" if `!currentIndividual`\n   - But after loading, what if the fetch returned null? No error boundary\n\n---\n\n### 6. TYPESCRIPT & TYPE SAFETY ISSUES\n\n**A. Type casting without null checks**\n   - PersonHeader.tsx (line 41): `clientAssociations.map((ca: ClientAssociation) => ...)`\n   - RelationshipsSection.tsx (line 118): `RELATIONSHIP_LABELS[rel.relationship_type as RelationshipType]`\n   - ContactHistorySection.tsx (line 100): `TYPE_LABELS[entry.type as ContactHistoryType]`\n   - Using `as` casts suggests types from API might not match; should add validation\n\n**B. Unused import**\n   - PersonHeader.tsx (line 4): Imports `ClientAssociation` type but it's only used implicitly via the data\n\n---\n\n### 7. PERFORMANCE & STATE MANAGEMENT\n\n**A. Loading full data on every change**\n   - PersonDetailPage.tsx: `handleUpdatePerson`, `handleAddRelationship`, `handleAddContactHistory`, `handleEditContactHistory` all call `loadData()` (lines 42, 55, 68, 81)\n   - This refetches all relationships and contact history on single entry change - inefficient\n   - Should either optimistically update Redux state or refetch only what changed\n\n**B. Redux slice is minimal**\n   - individualsSlice.ts only has `fetchIndividual` thunk\n   - Missing: Update, Add, Delete, Edit thunks\n   - All mutations are direct fetch calls in components rather than through Redux\n   - Makes testing harder and duplicates logic across components\n\n---\n\n### 8. VALIDATION ISSUES\n\n**A. Add RelationshipModal insufficient validation**\n   - Only checks if ID is non-empty (line 82)\n   - No validation that the ID actually exists before sending\n   - No check for self-relationships (adding yourself)\n   - No check for duplicate relationships\n\n**B. No validation in Add/Edit ContactHistory**\n   - AddContactHistoryModal.tsx (line 28): Only checks date and summary non-empty\n   - No date validation (e.g., no future dates, reasonable time bounds)\n   - No length limits on summary text\n   - team_member field is free text - no validation or suggestions\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Category | Severity | Count | Examples |\n|----------|----------|-------|----------|\n| Missing Delete functionality | Critical | 2 | Relationships, Contact History |\n| Missing person search | Critical | 1 | AddRelationshipModal |\n| Missing error handling | High | 4 | All fetch operations |\n| Inline JSX abstraction needed | Medium | 5+ | Filters, toggles, form fields |\n| Duplicated code/types | Medium | 3 | Type labels, date formatting |\n| Backend underutilization | Medium | 2 | DELETE endpoints unused |\n| Type safety issues | Low | 3+ | Type casts without validation |\n\nAll reviewed files are at: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/PersonDetailPage.tsx`, `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/*`, `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/individuals.ts`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a52e0bd (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 44678\ntool_uses: 27\nduration_ms: 47392</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a47b4ab7-2fa2-4041-b9a2-ae128b707e7a","uuid":"97d70f78-0afa-4b5a-ae04-324faa812f18","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Review the PersonDetailPage implementation for code quality issues.
