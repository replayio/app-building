3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)
   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views.

Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.
