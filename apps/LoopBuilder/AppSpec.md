App: Loop Builder
Initial Prompt: App which autonomously builds apps in a loop and shows the history and results.  Main page has a selector at top for which apps to show: apps currently being built, apps that have recently been finished, apps that have been queued but not started yet.  Below the selector is a "request an app" CTA which goes to the request page.  App cards show a title and description and link to the app page.  App page shows the above info with a link to the completed app (if available) and below that a feed with the AI output while developing the app, which is updated actively for in progress apps.  Request page is a wizard where the user describes the app they're looking for, then the system assesses whether it fits requirements (no personal info etc) and then either rejects the request with a reason or queues it and links to the page for the app.

Pages:

1. MainPage (/)
   Description: Main landing page for the autonomous app builder. Layout: at the top, there is a selector (e.g., tabs, dropdown, or segmented control) that filters which apps to show with three options: (1) apps currently being built, (2) apps that have recently been finished, and (3) apps that have been queued but not started yet. Directly below this selector, there is a prominent 'Request an app' call-to-action (CTA) button or section that navigates the user to the RequestPage. The main content area displays a list or grid of app cards. Each app card shows the app’s title and a short description, and each card links to that app’s dedicated AppPage. The page should support updating the visible list according to the selected filter, showing only apps in the corresponding state (in progress, recently finished, or queued).

2. AppPage (/apps/:id)
   Description: Detail page for a single autonomously built app. At the top, it displays the app’s title and description, matching or expanding on the information shown in the app card. If a completed app is available, the page includes a clear link or button to access or open the completed app (e.g., a URL to the deployed app or a download link). Below the main info section, there is a chronological feed or activity log showing the AI output while developing the app (e.g., status updates, logs, intermediate reasoning or steps). For in-progress apps, this feed is actively updated in real time or via periodic refresh, so the user can watch the development process as it happens. For completed or queued apps, the feed shows the historical development output or indicates that development has not yet started, respectively.

3. RequestPage (/request)
   Description: A multi-step wizard where the user can request a new app. Step 1: the user describes the app they are looking for, likely via a text input or form with fields capturing requirements and details. After submission, the system assesses whether the request fits policy and technical requirements (e.g., no personal information, disallowed content, or other restricted criteria). Based on this assessment, the wizard either (a) rejects the request, displaying a clear rejection message and a reason for rejection, or (b) accepts the request, queues the app for autonomous building, and then shows a confirmation screen with a link to the new app’s AppPage where the user can monitor its progress. The layout should guide the user step-by-step, indicate progress through the wizard, handle validation errors, and clearly communicate the outcome of the assessment.
