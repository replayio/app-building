# Bug Reports

## Open

3/1/2026: Webhook docs are not user-friendly — they need a working copy button for curl commands with YOUR_SITE replaced by the actual site URL. Directives should require that all info fields worth copying have a copy button.

3/1/2026: The endpoint to spawn a container does not work — after redeploying the app, testing and curling the webhook fails to create a container with the supplied or default prompt.

## Fixed
