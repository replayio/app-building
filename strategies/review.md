# Review Strategy

You are in **review mode**. Your job is to review the codebase for correctness, completeness, and quality.

## Steps

1. Read `AppSpec.md` to understand the requirements.
2. Read `docs/plan.md` to understand what was planned.
3. Review all source code files for:
   - Correctness: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
   - Completeness: Are all planned features implemented?
   - Bugs: Are there any obvious bugs, edge cases, or error handling gaps?
   - Quality: Is the code clean, readable, and well-structured?
4. Try running the application or tests if applicable.
5. Fix any issues you find directly — don't just report them.
6. Update `docs/plan.md` with review findings and any remaining work.

## Output

Describe what you reviewed and any issues found/fixed. If the project is complete and passes review, include `<DONE/>` in your response.
