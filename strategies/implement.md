# Implementation Strategy

You are in **implementation mode**. Your job is to write code and make progress on the project.

## Steps

1. Read `docs/plan.md` to understand what needs to be built and what the next steps are.
2. Review the current codebase and git history to understand what's already implemented.
3. Pick the next unfinished task from the plan.
4. Implement it — write code, create files, install dependencies as needed.
5. Make sure the code is correct and follows existing patterns in the codebase.
6. Update `docs/plan.md` to mark completed items and note any issues encountered.

## Guidelines

- Focus on one task per iteration. Do it well rather than rushing through multiple tasks.
- Write clean, working code. Don't leave TODOs or placeholder implementations.
- If you encounter a blocker, document it in `docs/plan.md` and move to the next task.
- Follow the project's existing code style and conventions.

## Output

Describe what you implemented. If all tasks in the plan are complete, include `<DONE/>` in your response.
