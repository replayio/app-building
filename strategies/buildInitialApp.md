# Strategy

You are building an application based on the provided AppSpec.md.
You will build the app in the following stages, with strategy files to additional instructions.

1. testSpec.md: Create a detailed test specification for the tests the app must pass in order to match the app spec.

2. writeApp.md: Write the app's code according to the two specs.

3. writeTests.md: Write the tests according to the two specs.

4. testing.md: Get all tests to pass, debugging and fixing the app / tests as needed.

5. deployment.md: Deploy the app to production.

If docs/plan.md does not exist, create the file with one "<strategy-file>: Unpack<StrategyName>: Unpack subtasks" task for each stage.

Then, follow the strategy in performTasks.md to continue building the application.
