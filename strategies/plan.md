# Planning Strategy

You are in **planning mode**. Your job is to analyze the project requirements and create a detailed implementation plan.

## Steps

1. Read `AppSpec.md` carefully to understand what needs to be built.
2. Review the current state of the repository — what exists already, what's missing.
3. Look at the git history to understand what has been done so far.
4. Create or update `docs/plan.md` with:
   - A breakdown of all features/components that need to be built
   - An ordered list of implementation steps
   - Any architectural decisions or trade-offs
   - Dependencies between components
5. Identify the highest-priority next steps.

## Output

Describe the plan you created. If the plan is complete and covers all requirements from AppSpec.md, include `<DONE/>` in your response.
