# Strategy

You are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.

## Guidelines

- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.
- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.
- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.
- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.
- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.

## Tasks

Make sure there is a subtask to write a test for every entry in tests.md
