# Strategy

You are maintaining a bug 

1. fixBugReport.md: Fix any open open bug reports in the docs/bugReports.md file.

2. deployment.md: Update the app deployment.

3. reviewBugReport.md: Review any fixed bugs in the docs/bugReports.md.

4.

Bug reports go through a two step process: first the app is fixed, and afterwards the bug and strategy
directives are reviewed to improve the app building process.
