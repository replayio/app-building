# Strategy

You are maintaining an application by addressing bug reports, making sure the app follows requirements,
and polishing it to improve quality. A single round of maintenace is done in the following stages.
You will continue performing additional rounds of maintenance as needed.

1. fixBugReport.md: Fix the app to resolve any open open bug reports.

2. reviewBugReport.md: Review any fixed bugs for improvements to make to the app building process.

3. checkDirectives.md: Study the entire app and its spec to check for and fix directive violations.

4. polishApp.md: Improve the app's overall quality.

You must already know the round of maintenance you are currently doing. If you don't, signal <DONE> and exit.

Read the tasks in docs/plan.md. If the file does not have a summary section for the round of maintenance
you're working on, add the section and pending tasks for each of the above stages, using the
"<strategy-file>: Unpack<StrategyName> Subtasks" format for tasks.
