This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes.

Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6146277c-5b30-4f6e-a0f6-36f2946cafc5","uuid":"d52dc0d9-51c7-4b78-8af8-89d1a72f40b8","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth).

For the modal, I need to verify the add button opens it, test the form fields including the optional client search, and ensure submission creates a new contact.\n\nI also need to account for side effects—creating a contact might trigger timeline entries on associated clients and send notifications to followers. The content component itself needs tests for the page layout, loading and empty states, pagination with 50 items per page, and the CSV export and import functionality.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2575,"cache_read_input_tokens":38703,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2575,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6146277c-5b30-4f6e-a0f6-36f2946cafc5","uuid":"a67b1bb3-6564-4b57-a185-8810acbc037c"}

I'm going to model the components after existing patterns like TasksListPage and build out the ContactsSearchBar for filtering, a ContactsTable with the standard columns, a CreateContactModal for adding new contacts, and the overall ContactsListContent layout with heading, buttons, and pagination.\n\nNow I'm writing the test entries following the same format as TasksListPage.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":937,"cache_read_input_tokens":41278,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":937,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6146277c-5b30-4f6e-a0f6-36f2946cafc5","uuid":"346f2f06-9dd3-4475-9ce9-300aef3c3d2e"}

Each row corresponds to a contact in the system.\n\n#### CSV import button opens import dialog\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded.\n- **Action:** User clicks the CSV import button (or selects import from a menu).\n- **Expected:** An ImportDialog modal opens. The dialog displays a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. A \"Download CSV template\" button is available. A file upload area or file picker is present for selecting a CSV file.\n\n#### CSV import processes valid file and creates contacts\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open. User has a valid CSV file with contacts data matching the expected format.\n- **Action:** User uploads the CSV file and confirms the import.\n- **Expected:** The contacts from the CSV are created via the bulk import API. The dialog shows a success message with the count of contacts imported. After closing the dialog, the contacts table refreshes and the newly imported contacts appear in the list. Client names in the CSV are matched to existing clients in the system for association. Timeline entries are created on associated clients for newly added contacts.\n\n#### CSV import shows validation errors for invalid data\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open. User has a CSV file with invalid data (e.g., missing required Name column, malformed email).\n- **Action:** User uploads the invalid CSV file and confirms the import.\n- **Expected:** The dialog displays per-row validation errors indicating which rows failed and why (e.g., \"Row 3: Name is required\"). Valid rows may still be imported, or the user may be asked to fix errors and retry. The error messages are specific enough for the user to correct the CSV.\n\n## SettingsPage (/settings)"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":637,"cache_read_input_tokens":42215,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":637,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6146277c-5b30-4f6e-a0f6-36f2946cafc5","uuid":"b533c50c-e33b-45f6-a93d-97fcea990458"}
