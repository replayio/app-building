TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps
STRATEGY: Agent fleshed out 4 incomplete observation tests (DDP-WRT-01, DDP-LTK-01, DDP-ATT-01, DDP-CON-01). Initial run had 3 failures (WRT-01, ATT-01, CON-01) due to incorrect locator logic (hasNot vs has filter). Used Replay PlaywrightSteps to identify the issue. Fixed locators. Second run still had WRT-01 and ATT-01 failures due to timing (API response not returned before assertion). Used Replay again to identify timing issue. Added waitFor after modal close. Third run had intermittent DDP-HIS-02 and DDP-HDR-04 failures (pre-existing, not modified). All 4 target tests consistently passed.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: DDP-WRT-01 now verifies writeup card title/date/author/content/edit+version buttons. DDP-LTK-01 verifies task checkbox/name/due date. DDP-ATT-01 verifies file preview/name/type/download/delete. DDP-CON-01 verifies avatar/name/role/company/View Profile link. Required multiple debugging iterations using Replay.
