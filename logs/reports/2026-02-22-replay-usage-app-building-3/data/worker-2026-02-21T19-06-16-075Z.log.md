NOTES: Iteration 161. Directive checking iteration for UsersListPage. No testSpec or writeApp violations in test entries/components. No Playwright test files exist for UsersListPage (gap noted). Agent queued a job to write the missing tests, and also queued a trailing job for the writeTests check since there were no tests to check.
