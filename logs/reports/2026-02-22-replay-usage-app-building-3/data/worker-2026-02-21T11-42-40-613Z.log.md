NOTES: Iteration 94. WriteApp job for ClientDetailPage components (ClientHeader, QuickActions, SourceInfoSection, ClientTasksSection). All four components already existed and were fully implemented with proper data-testid attributes, Redux integration, and CSS styling. TypeScript compiled cleanly. No changes needed. No Replay tools used.
