TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__Screenshot
STRATEGY: Agent updated TDP test spec entries and Playwright tests for persistence verification and timeline side effects. After first test run, TDP-HDR-01 timed out. Used Replay PlaywrightSteps to analyze the recording and discovered the test was stuck trying to click a client row on the clients list page. Used Screenshot tool to see the page state. Found the issue was using wrong locator for client rows (plain tr vs data-testid="client-row-*"). Also discovered that the due date input expected YYYY-MM-DD format, not YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM. Fixed both issues. Then TDP-HDR-01 timed out again on assignee field - discovered assignee FilterSelect testId was "create-task-assignee-name-trigger" not "create-task-assignee-trigger". Fixed approach to use plain text input. All 7 tests then passed.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 89. Updated TDP test spec entries for persistence and timeline verification. Used Replay to debug multiple TDP-HDR-01 failures. Cost $2.63, 48 turns.
