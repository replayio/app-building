TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages
STRATEGY: Agent wrote 8 new/updated PersonDetailPage tests. 2 tests failed (PDP-REL-05, PDP-CH-04). Used Replay PlaywrightSteps to analyze PDP-REL-05 failure and discovered the relationship-type-select was a custom FilterSelect div, not a native select element. Also checked ConsoleMessages for the PDP-CH-04 recording. Fixed both tests to use the FilterSelect trigger/option pattern. All 22 tests then passed.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 77. Fixed 8 writeTests.md violations in person-detail-page.spec.ts. Used Replay to diagnose FilterSelect interaction issues. Cost $2.04, 35 turns.
