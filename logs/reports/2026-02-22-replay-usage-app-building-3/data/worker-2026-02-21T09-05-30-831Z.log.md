TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__ReadSource, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__InspectElement, mcp__replay__UncaughtException, mcp__replay__ReactException, mcp__replay__Logpoint, mcp__replay__Evaluate, mcp__replay__DescribePoint, mcp__replay__ListSources
STRATEGY: Agent set up full test infrastructure (Playwright config with Replay browser, Neon ephemeral branches, seed script, test runner script with OpenSSL 1.1 support). Ran tests iteratively, using Replay recordings to diagnose failures. Fixed app bugs (date parsing in ClientTasksSection, stale server reuse) and test bugs (h1 ambiguity, auth token persistence, parallel test interference, invalid priority values, timeline event count assertions). Used Replay MCP tools extensively to inspect network requests, evaluate expressions at specific execution points, take screenshots, and trace source code execution.
SUCCESS: partial
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: FixTests iteration. Ran all 19 test spec files. Fixed many failures: sidebar-auth (36/36), confirm-email (6/6), forgot-password (7/7), reset-password (9/9), settings-page (2/2), settings-email-notifications (8/8), settings-webhooks (20/20), client-detail-page (40/40), tasks-list-page (36/39), client-detail-timeline (12/14). Several test files still had failures due to parallel test interference, stale server issues, and component test ID mismatches. Agent used Replay MCP tools extensively to diagnose root causes including network request analysis, source code tracing, logpoints, and screenshot inspection. Created bug reports in docs/bugs/.
