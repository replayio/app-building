STRATEGY: Agent fixed DDP-HIS-02 toPass deadlock, DDP-ATT-04 title mismatch, and DDP-WRT-04 missing assertions. After first fix attempt, DDP-HIS-02 still failed. Used Replay to analyze the recording extensively: PlaywrightSteps, ConsoleMessages, NetworkRequest, SearchSources, Logpoint, Screenshot, DescribeComponent, ReactComponents, ReadSource, and ListSources. Discovered that DealHistorySection rendered 18 times and the history entry was not created because parallel test DDP-HDR-04 had already changed the stage to "proposal" first, so the stage change was a no-op. Fixed by using a unique stage "negotiation" instead. After fix, 1 more test still failed (DDP-HIS-02 again). Used Replay again to analyze and found the race condition with parallel tests. Changed target stage and removed exact count assertion. All 28 tests then passed.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 80. Extensive Replay usage with 10 different MCP tools to debug DDP-HIS-02 flaky test caused by parallel test race conditions. Cost $5.28, 75 turns.
