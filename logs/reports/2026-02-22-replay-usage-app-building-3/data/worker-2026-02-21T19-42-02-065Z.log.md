TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_TOOLS: none
STRATEGY: Agent added missing deal link navigation test to ClientDetailPage TasksSection. Made the deal text a clickable Link component. Initial test run showed regression - existing "task title navigates" test failed because clicks on the task content div could hit the new deal link. Agent fixed by making the test click the task title text specifically. Second run: 40 passed, 2 failed (same pre-existing failures as previous iteration). Agent diagnosed both regressions and pre-existing failures through error message analysis without needing Replay.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 168. Agent introduced then fixed a regression. Initial change made deal link clickable but broke the existing task title navigation test. Fixed by updating the test to click on the specific task title element. 2 pre-existing failures in ClientHeader and SourceInfoSection remained (unrelated).
