TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_TOOLS: none
STRATEGY: Agent added 3 cross-page side-effect tests for TasksListPage (cancel task to ClientDetailPage, delete task to ClientDetailPage/DealDetailPage, task creation timeline event). Pre-existing flaky debounce test failed (not related to changes). Agent did not use Replay because the failure was clearly a known pre-existing flaky test unrelated to the work.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 165. 42 passed, 1 failed. The single failure was a pre-existing flaky debounce timing test. All 3 new cross-page effect tests passed. No app code changes needed since backend/frontend already supported the behaviors.
