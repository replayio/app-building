TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_TOOLS: none
STRATEGY: Agent added timeline side-effect verification to 3 ClientDetailPage mutation tests (tag editing, task creation, person addition). Required adding tag-specific timeline event creation in the frontend. 2 pre-existing test failures remained (client name edit and source info persistence) unrelated to changes. Agent diagnosed these as pre-existing without needing Replay since the error messages clearly indicated different test data issues.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 167. 40 passed, 2 failed. The 2 failures were pre-existing issues in ClientHeader and SourceInfoSection, unrelated to the timeline verification changes. All 3 modified tests (tags, task creation, person addition) passed successfully.
