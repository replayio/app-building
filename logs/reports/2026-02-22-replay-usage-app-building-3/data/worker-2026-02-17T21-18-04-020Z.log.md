TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__Timeline, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__ReadSource, mcp__replay__ListSources
STRATEGY: Ran auth e2e tests with Replay recording. Uploaded recording and used MCP tools to inspect timeline, network requests, and console messages. Analyzed auth flow execution pattern. Discovered production database was missing the "users" table (NeonDbError: relation "users" does not exist).
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Comprehensive Replay MCP debugging session. Used 6 different tools. Replay confirmed auth flow worked locally; the real issue was production DB schema drift. Updated deployment strategy to require database schema sync.
