TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__Logpoint
STRATEGY: Agent fixed PDP-CH-01 test title and added assertions for entry row details. Test failed because navigated person had no contact history entries. Agent used Replay MCP tools to diagnose: checked PlaywrightSteps to find the failing step, searched sources to find entry rendering had 0 hits, set logpoints to confirm entries array was empty across all renders. Identified root cause as seed data not guaranteeing contact history on the navigated person.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 18 on container app-building-hv0dch. Fixed PDP-CH-01 test title from section with controls to chronological log, added row-level assertions. Initial failure due to empty entries on navigated person (recording d8a3c082-3fbd-4bd9-8c9f-37557bbbf573). Fixed by adding entry creation when section is empty. All 24 person-detail-page tests passed on second run.
