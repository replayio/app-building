TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__Timeline, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__Logpoint, mcp__replay__ReadSource, mcp__replay__Evaluate, mcp__replay__InspectElement
STRATEGY: Ran cross-cutting tests (10/11, DATA-02 failing). Used Timeline to discover PUT aborted due to page navigating away. PlaywrightSteps revealed DOM race condition. Logpoint+Evaluate traced Redux fetch ordering.
SUCCESS: partial
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Excellent debugging. PlaywrightSteps revealed exact DOM race condition. Logpoint+Evaluate confirmed Redux fetch ordering issue. Fix reverted by user (loading flashes).
