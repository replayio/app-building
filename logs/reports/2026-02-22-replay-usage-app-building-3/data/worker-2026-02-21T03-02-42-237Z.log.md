NOTES: Iteration 23. Wrote DealsListPage with 4 components plus the page: DealsFilterBar (search + stage/client/status dropdowns + sort), DealsTable (7-column grid with stage/status badges, pagination), DealsPipeline (kanban board with HTML5 drag-and-drop, 6 stage columns), CreateDealModal (form with client selector, owner dropdown). Page includes summary stat cards and table/pipeline view toggle. All checks pass. Cost was .37.
