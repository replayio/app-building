TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__Logpoint, mcp__replay__Timeline, mcp__replay__InspectElement
STRATEGY: Continued debugging 3 failures (DATA-02, ATOM-02, ATOM-03). Analyzed recordings with MCP tools. Found stale server connection issue.
SUCCESS: partial
REPLAY_ERRORS: First recording was a stub. Longer recording showed wrong test. SearchSources 0 hits confirmed recording didn't capture the failure.
NOTES: Good MCP tool usage but same recording-to-test matching problem persisted.
