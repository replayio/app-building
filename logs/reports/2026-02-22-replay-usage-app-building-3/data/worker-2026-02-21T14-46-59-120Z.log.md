NOTES: Iteration 138. Checked testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md directive violations in ClientsListPage. Found major violations: 3 testSpec violations (missing three-dot menu tests), 11 writeApp violations (mismatched filters, missing features like action menu, pagination, import/export), 2 writeTests violations (no dedicated test file, getByText usage in deployment.spec.ts). Added multiple fix groups.
