TEST_FAILURE: no
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Interactive session (not worker iteration). Agent was asked to deploy the app. Fixed 7 pre-existing lint errors, fixed stale Neon project credentials, fixed deploy.ts broken --json CLI call, fixed deployment.spec.ts URL parsing, fixed playwright.deployment.config.ts to use replayDevices. Deployment test passed. Agent used Replay tools (Screenshot and NetworkRequest) to verify the deployment recording showed correct app behavior (GET /clients 200, POST /clients 201).
