TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__Timeline
STRATEGY: Massive Maintenance Round 9 iteration (303 turns). Fixed 4 bugs (CSV import, multi-entity CSV import, settings/webhooks, users page). Multiple test failures along the way: strict mode violation, DLP-FLT-04 flaky test, STP-WH-04 data contamination, FilterSelect .fill() misuse, TLP-HDR-02 ambiguous selector, TypeScript errors. All fixed iteratively. Used mcp__replay__Timeline to verify deployment recording.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Very long iteration. Most test failures fixed by iterative code changes, not Replay-based debugging. Replay used only at the end for deployment verification. All 209 tests pass at the end.
