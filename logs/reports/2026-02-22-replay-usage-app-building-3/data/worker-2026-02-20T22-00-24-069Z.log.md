NOTES: Standardized 'Proposal Sent' label across 4 component files, 2 test files, and 6 test spec entries. Fixed stage naming inconsistency between DealsPipelineView/DealHistorySection (used 'Proposal') and DealStageBadge/DealsFilterControls/CreateDealModal (used 'Proposal Sent'). Both deals-list-page and deal-detail-page test suites passed.
