STRATEGY: Agent added Status dropdown to CreateDealModal and owner display to PipelineView. Tests failed because the new status value "on_track" violated a database CHECK constraint (status IN open/won/lost). Agent used Replay to analyze the failure recording, examining network requests and console messages to understand why the modal was not closing after submission. After identifying the DB constraint issue, agent updated the schema, seed data, and backend defaults.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 150. 4 test failures after initial code change (CreateDealModal not closing due to DB constraint violation). Agent used Replay MCP tools extensively to diagnose the root cause by examining the recording of the failed test. Successfully fixed by updating DB CHECK constraint, default status values, and active deal filtering. All 74 tests passed after fix.
