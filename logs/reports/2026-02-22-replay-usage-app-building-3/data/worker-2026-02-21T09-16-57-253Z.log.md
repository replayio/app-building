TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__UncaughtException, mcp__replay__ReactException
STRATEGY: Agent deployed SalesCRM to production (created Neon DB, Netlify site, deploy script). Then wrote a deployment test using Replay Chromium browser. First test failed due to stale DATABASE_URL on Netlify. Agent fixed env var, redeployed, and rewrote test for correct selectors. Test passed on retry. Agent then used Replay MCP tools to verify the recording: checked console messages (no errors), network requests (all 200/201), uncaught exceptions (none), and React exceptions (none).
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Full deployment pipeline created and tested. Replay MCP tools used to validate the successful deployment test recording (76c4b07c-250c-4bca-b31a-7474593be6e0). 76 turns, cost $3.23.
