TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__Logpoint, mcp__replay__ReadSource, mcp__replay__Evaluate, mcp__replay__InspectElement, mcp__replay__ListSources
STRATEGY: Used PlaywrightSteps to precisely identify .toPass() deadlock: DOM changed mid-iteration causing textContent() auto-wait to hang. Logpoint on fetchTasks.fulfilled traced Redux state. Evaluate inspected items array at specific points.
SUCCESS: partial
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Outstanding debugging. Methodically identified deadlock root cause. Fix technically correct but reverted; agent guided to fix test instead.
