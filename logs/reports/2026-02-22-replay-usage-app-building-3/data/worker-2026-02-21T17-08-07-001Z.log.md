TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes

STRATEGY: Created deals-list-page.spec.ts with 74 tests and DealsImportExport component. Initially had 5 failures: stage label mismatch (DB had qualification/discovery not in label map), status value mismatch (DB uses open not active), and 3 import failures. Fixed stage/status label maps. Used Replay MCP tools to debug import failures - discovered DB CHECK constraint violation (status IN open/won/lost but import sent active). Fixed status mapping in import component. Final run: 74/74 passed.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 148. This is the only log where Replay MCP tools were actively used. The agent used PlaywrightSteps, NetworkRequest, SearchSources, Logpoint, ConsoleMessages, UncaughtException, and ReadSource to trace through the import flow and identify a DB constraint violation causing import test failures. The Replay debugging was instrumental in finding the root cause (status value mismatch between UI and DB constraint).
