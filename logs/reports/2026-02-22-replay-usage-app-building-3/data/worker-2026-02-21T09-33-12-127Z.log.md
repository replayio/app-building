STRATEGY: Agent fixed ResetPasswordPage test assertion gaps (added sidebar user check and old-password rejection check). Tests ran and the e2e test failed. Agent used Replay MCP tools extensively to debug: checked Playwright steps, console messages, network requests, searched sources, read source code, set logpoints on sign-in calls, took screenshots, and evaluated expressions at specific points. Discovered the second sign-in got a Netlify Functions 404 (transient server issue). Fixed by adding page.goto reload between sign-in attempts. Tests passed on retry.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Replay recording 4144647d-27f3-4d09-baec-419efdfc70b1 analyzed with 8 different MCP tools. Agent used Logpoint and Evaluate to inspect runtime values, Screenshot to see page state, and SearchSources/ReadSource to find relevant code. All 9 ResetPasswordPage tests passed after fix. Cost $2.46.
