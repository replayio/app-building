TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__Timeline, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest
STRATEGY: Fixed Bug 1 (replaced Google OAuth with email/password login). All 188 Playwright tests passed locally. Deployed to production and ran deployment test with Replay browser. Used Replay MCP tools to verify deployment recording showed correct data flow (clients API 200, POST 201, GET refresh 200).
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Test failure was a production deployment issue, not automated test suite failure. Replay MCP tools confirmed deployment test passed correctly.
