TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__LocalStorage, mcp__replay__GetStack, mcp__replay__DescribePoint, mcp__replay__Evaluate, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__ReadSource
STRATEGY: Implemented Neon database branching for test isolation. Multiple test runs (81→206 passing). Uploaded recording and used 8 MCP tools extensively: NetworkRequest found NO API calls in recording, LocalStorage tracked auth token lifecycle, GetStack traced removeToken() calls, DescribePoint understood execution context, Evaluate inspected runtime values, SearchSources found fetch hit counts, ReadSource analyzed monkey-patched fetch interceptor. Diagnosed root cause: reuseExistingServer reusing stale dev server with deleted Neon branch's DATABASE_URL.
SUCCESS: partial
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Most intensive Replay MCP debugging session across all logs. Used 8 different tools to deeply trace from "no API calls" → "auth token removed" → "401 from auth" → "JWT ok but DB query fails on deleted branch" → "reuseExistingServer reusing stale server". 15+ test runs in session.
