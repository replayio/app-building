NOTES: Iteration 86. Deployed SalesCRM to production and ran deployment test. Test passed with Replay recording a87aea72-72d2-42e1-8500-ef0e0cc69646. Used extensive Replay MCP tools: PlaywrightSteps to verify all steps passed, Screenshot for visual inspection, NetworkRequest to verify API calls (all 200/201/304), ConsoleMessages to check for errors (only React DevTools info), UncaughtException and ReactException to confirm no exceptions. Thorough deployment verification.
