TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes

STRATEGY: Agent wrote new ClientDetailPage tests, ran them, and 3 tests failed (CDP-HDR-03, CDP-HDR-04, CDP-HDR-05). Used Replay to analyze CDP-HDR-04 failure recording. Discovered that the PUT request sent correct data but after reload the DB returned stale values. Used Logpoints to trace the PUT response vs GET response after reload. Identified that parallel tests running concurrently overwrote each other's changes (fullyParallel: true). Fixed by removing page.reload() and using networkidle wait instead of reload-based persistence checks. Also fixed CDP-HDR-02 which had the same issue. Then all 41 tests passed.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 75. Major test writing and debugging session. Agent wrote 20+ new ClientDetailPage tests, diagnosed parallel test race conditions using Replay's Logpoint and NetworkRequest tools across multiple recordings. Cost $7.58, 82 turns.
