TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__Logpoint
STRATEGY: Agent ran STP-WH-07 test which timed out. Uploaded the failing test recording, used PlaywrightSteps to identify where the test got stuck (after clicking toggle), used ConsoleMessages to check for errors, used NetworkRequest to inspect API calls, used SearchSources and Logpoint to determine the handleToggleWebhook function was never called (0 hits). Identified the root cause: the data-testid was on the sr-only hidden input, so Playwright click did not reach it. Moved the testid to the visible label element.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 96. Two jobs: add missing webhook test entries (STP-WH-07, STP-WH-08) and verify tests pass. STP-WH-07 failed initially due to sr-only checkbox click issue. Replay analysis pinpointed the exact root cause. After fix, all 11 settings page tests passed.
