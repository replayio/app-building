TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps
STRATEGY: Agent fixed DealsTable status badges and added three-dot action menu. Initial test run had 1 failure (status badge test) because seed data used old status values (open/won/lost). Agent used Replay to view Playwright steps of the failed test recording to confirm the issue was seed data mismatch. Also had 3 DealsImportExport failures due to CSV test data using old status values. Agent updated seed data and import component.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 152. Multiple test failures during development: first the status badge test, then 3 import tests. Agent used Replay PlaywrightSteps on the first failure recording to diagnose seed data mismatch. Successfully fixed all issues. Final result: all 83 tests passed.
