TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__Logpoint, mcp__replay__Timeline, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__InspectElement, mcp__replay__ReadSource, mcp__replay__Evaluate, mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps
STRATEGY: Ran full suite (208/209, ATOM-03 failing). Uploaded recording and analyzed with 10 MCP tools. Investigated client detail page loading issue and Replay reporter config.
SUCCESS: partial
REPLAY_ERRORS: Uploaded recording was a stub (2.7s) that didn't contain the failure. Couldn't match recordings to failing tests without metadata.
NOTES: Most comprehensive MCP usage - 10 tools. Fundamental challenge was matching recordings to failing tests without metadata.
