TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__Screenshot
STRATEGY: Agent updated TDP-HDR-01 to verify more fields (priority badge, due date, assignee, description, client/deal names), updated TDP-NTS-02 to verify author/timestamp, strengthened TDP-HDR-02 timeline side effect. After first run, TDP-HDR-01 timed out - used Replay PlaywrightSteps to see it got stuck at step 9 clicking assignee trigger. Used Screenshot to check page state. Discovered the correct testId was "create-task-assignee-name-trigger" not "create-task-assignee-trigger". Fixed the test to use the assignee name text input directly. Also fixed due date format (YYYY-MM-DD not datetime-local). All 7 tests then passed.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 90. Test completeness improvements for TaskDetailPage. Used Replay to debug TDP-HDR-01 timeout caused by wrong testId for FilterSelect trigger. Cost $2.07, 47 turns.
