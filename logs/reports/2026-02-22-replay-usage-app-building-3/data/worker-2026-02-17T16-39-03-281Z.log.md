TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_TOOLS: none
STRATEGY: Fixed SSO auth bug, then debugged sidebar-sign-in test ID not found due to Playwright storageState caching. Used error context files and screenshots instead of Replay MCP tools. Eventually fixed by passing explicit empty storageState to browser.newContext().
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: All 188 tests eventually passed. Agent added testing strategy tip about explicit empty storageState. Did NOT use Replay MCP tools despite having recordings available.
