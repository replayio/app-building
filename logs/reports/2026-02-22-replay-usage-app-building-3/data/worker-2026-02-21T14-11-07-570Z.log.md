TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_TOOLS: none
STRATEGY: Added missing test entries and Playwright tests for ClientDetailPage (breadcrumb link navigation, saving client name inline edit). Ran client-detail-page tests. 41/42 passed; 1 pre-existing failure in Date Acquired field test.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 128. Both new tests passed. The pre-existing Date Acquired test failure was unrelated to the changes.
