TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_TOOLS: none
STRATEGY: Ran tests (56→207 passing). Identified missing NEON_PROJECT_ID. Investigated DDP-HIS-02 and ATOM-03 using error-context.md snapshots and code analysis. Fixed DDP-HIS-02 (wait for button enabled), fixed ATOM-03 (added error state handling). Agent stopped a Replay recording upload mid-flight saying "I have enough information".
SUCCESS: partial
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: No mcp__replay__* tools called despite recordings available. Debugging done entirely through code reading and error-context.md snapshots. Violated strategy by stopping Replay upload.
