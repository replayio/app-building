TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps
STRATEGY: Agent added urgent priority handling to TaskCardList (getPriorityClass/getPriorityLabel), added priority-urgent CSS class, added Delete task menu option with confirmation dialog, and updated tests. Ran tests: 39 passed, 1 failed (pre-existing flaky debounce test). Agent analyzed the failing test with Replay PlaywrightSteps to determine the failure was a timing race condition in the debounce test (typing delay caused debounce to fire mid-typing), confirming it was unrelated to the changes.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Replay recording 30f0bd06-8ed5-41ec-80bf-6a23b9fb01e1 analyzed with PlaywrightSteps to confirm flaky debounce test was pre-existing and unrelated. 39/40 tests passed. Cost $2.23.
