TEST_FAILURE: no
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__ReactComponents, mcp__replay__Timeline
STRATEGY: Updated Vite config to use React development build for component display names. Deployed and ran deployment test with Replay browser. Used ReactComponents to verify full React component tree was visible in recording.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Verification/validation use case rather than debugging a failure. Confirmed React dev build exposed component names correctly.
