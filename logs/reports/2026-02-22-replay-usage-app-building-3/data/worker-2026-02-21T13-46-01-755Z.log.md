STRATEGY: The agent fixed priority mismatch violations across TasksListPage components (Normal->Urgent, default normal->medium). Ran tests after fixes. 39/40 passed; 1 pre-existing flaky failure in debounce test unrelated to changes.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 124. Fixed priority mismatch in CreateTaskModal, TasksImportExport, tasks.ts backend, TasksFilterBar, and test file. All priority-related tests passed. The one failure (Filter text input uses debounced input) was pre-existing and unrelated.
