TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__Evaluate, mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__UncaughtException, mcp__replay__Screenshot
STRATEGY: Agent fixed multiple incomplete CDP tests and added missing cancel/timeline tests. Initial test run had 2 failures (CDP-HDR-02 flaky, CDP-HDR-03/05 status persistence). Used Replay to analyze failures. On re-run all 53 tests passed. The initial failures were intermittent concurrency issues.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Fixed 7 incomplete CDP tests (QA-02, QA-04, ATT-01, ATT-02, ATT-03, TL-03, HDR-02-05 timeline assertions). Added 9 new tests (QA-10 through QA-13 cancel buttons, TL-04 through TL-08 timeline accuracy/atomicity). All 53 CDP tests passed.
