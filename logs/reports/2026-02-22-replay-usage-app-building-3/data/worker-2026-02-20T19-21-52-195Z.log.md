NOTES: Iteration 7. Three jobs: classify DealDetailClientField bug, update directives, mark as reviewed. Reclassified problem stage from writeApp.md to writeTests.md (the test spec was correct but the Playwright test did not verify client field editing). Added new directive to writeTests.md about exercising each specific field interaction. Moved bug to Finished. No tests run, no Replay usage.
