TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__InspectElement, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__SearchSources, mcp__replay__Logpoint, mcp__replay__ConsoleMessages, mcp__replay__DescribeComponent, mcp__replay__ReactComponents
STRATEGY: Multi-pass debugging: (1) PlaywrightSteps+InspectElement+Screenshot+NetworkRequest+SearchSources+Logpoint to identify DOM state issues in DDP-LTK-04. (2) Second round with ConsoleMessages+DescribeComponent+ReactComponents to find SQL sort order changed after data refresh. Fixed by targeting task by title instead of .last().
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: 9 distinct Replay MCP tools used across two debugging rounds. DDP-LTK-03 count assertion and DDP-LTK-04 task ordering both fixed. Cost $4.95, 70 turns -- most expensive iteration.
