TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_TOOLS: none
STRATEGY: Agent fixed TaskPriorityBadge to use CSS variables and removed outer margins from TasksPageHeader and TasksFilterBar. After first test run, TLP-CRD-02 failed because it checked for Tailwind class names that were removed. Agent updated the test to check computed background-color CSS values instead. All 24 tests then passed on re-run.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 88. CSS variable migration and margin refactoring. Test failure was straightforward (class name mismatch) so Replay was not needed. Cost $0.97, 30 turns.
