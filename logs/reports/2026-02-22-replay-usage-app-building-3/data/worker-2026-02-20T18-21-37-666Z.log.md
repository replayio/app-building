NOTES: Iteration 1 of new container (app-building-4empua). Initial prompt session that set up maintenance round: queued 5 job groups (fixBugReport, reviewBugReport, checkDirectives, polishApp, deployment) and unpacked 3 bug fix groups (auth improvements, email notifications, contacts page). Then began implementing auth improvements (email confirmation, forgot password) but the session was primarily setup/implementation without test runs.
