TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_TOOLS: none
STRATEGY: Agent verified existing test script (scripts/test.ts), fixed NEON_PROJECT_ID sourcing from .env, and ran the full test suite. One pre-existing test failure was noted (Sign Out logs the user out) but was not debugged since it was not related to the test script implementation task.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 115. Agent verified and fixed test script implementation. Ran full test suite: 35 passed, 1 pre-existing failure. The test script itself worked correctly end-to-end (created ephemeral branch, seeded DB, ran Playwright, uploaded failed recording to Replay, cleaned up). No Replay MCP tools used despite the test script itself interacting with Replay for recording uploads.
