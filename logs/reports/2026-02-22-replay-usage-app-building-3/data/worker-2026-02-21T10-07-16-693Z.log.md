TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: no
REPLAY_TOOLS: none
STRATEGY: Agent replaced .first() workarounds with specific selectors across 3 test files. First test run failed (all tests failed at sign-in - transient infrastructure issue). Agent used git stash to verify original tests pass (they did), then popped stash and retried - all passed. Ran client-detail-timeline tests - 13/14 passed with 1 transient failure. Retried and all 14 passed. All 3 test files (66 tests total) passed.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Fixed .first() violations in client-detail-page.spec.ts, client-detail-timeline.spec.ts, and client-detail-deals-people.spec.ts. Added unique per-row data-testid to ClientsTable component. Agent identified the initial failure as transient via git stash comparison rather than using Replay tools. 66 total tests passed. Cost $2.08.
