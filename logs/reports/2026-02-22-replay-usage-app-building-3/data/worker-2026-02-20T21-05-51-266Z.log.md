STRATEGY: Agent added create-new-person option to AddRelationshipModal and wrote PDP-REL-04a test. Tests PDP-REL-04a and PDP-REL-05 failed due to parallel test isolation (count-based assertions conflicted when multiple tests modified the same person). Agent used Replay MCP tools extensively to diagnose: checked PlaywrightSteps, network requests, searched sources, set logpoints to trace API calls and data flow, evaluated expressions, took screenshots. Identified root cause as parallel test race condition on relationship counts.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Iteration 17 on container app-building-hv0dch. Added POST /individuals endpoint, create-new-person UI to AddRelationshipModal, new PDP-REL-04a test entry and Playwright test. Initial test failures on PDP-REL-04a and PDP-REL-05 were diagnosed via Replay (recording 7357c55a-cf65-4b25-8189-1ffb189af5a7). Fixed by changing count-based assertions to name-based assertions. All 23 person-detail-page tests passed on second run.
