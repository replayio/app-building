TEST_FAILURE: yes
REPLAY_USED: yes
REPLAY_TOOLS: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps
STRATEGY: Agent fixed DLP-TBL-05 sort test and DLP-FLT-06 date filter test. Initial run had 2 failures. Used Replay to analyze the DLP-TBL-05 timeout (nested-wait deadlock from count()+nth().textContent() pattern) and DLP-FLT-06 toBeLessThan failure (networkidle race). Fixed by using atomic allTextContents() and waitForResponse.
SUCCESS: yes
REPLAY_ERRORS: none
NOTES: Both DLP-TBL-05 and DLP-FLT-06 tests were rewritten to use atomic operations. Also added directional arrow icons to DealsTable sort button. All 30 deals-list-page tests passed after fixes.
