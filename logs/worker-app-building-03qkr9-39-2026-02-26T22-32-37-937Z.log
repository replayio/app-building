Add persistence assertions to Input/Output account creation test entries**\n\nLooking at the \"Create Stock Account\" flow:\n- Line 383: \"And: The new account is persisted to the database\" ✓\n\nNow looking at Input account creation (lines 414-421):\n- \"Test: Submitting the create input account form adds a new input account\"\n- Missing: \"And: The new account is persisted to the database\" ✗\n\nAnd Output account creation (lines 437-444):\n- \"Test: Submitting the create output account form adds a new output account\"\n\n\n- Missing: \"And: The new account is persisted to the database\" ✗\n\nThis violates the directive that any user action mutating data must have test entries verifying persistence.\n\n**2. Add styling assertions to Create Input/Output Account button test entries matching Create Stock Account pattern**\n\nLooking at the \"Create Stock Account button\" test (lines 359-364):\n- \"And: The button has a plus (+) icon and the text 'Create Stock Account'\"\n- \"And: The button is styled as a primary action button (blue/filled)\" ✓\n\nNow looking at \"Create Input Account button\" test (lines 400-404) and \"Create Output Account button\" test - both are missing the styling assertion that matches the stock account button pattern.\n\nThis violates the directive that button appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test entry should verify that appearance.\n\n**3. Add edit modal validation test entry verifying Account Name is required**\n\nThe create account modal has a validation test (lines 385-391) checking that Account Name is required, but the edit account modal tests (lines 459-467) don't have an equivalent validation test.\n\nThis violates the directive: \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\"\n\nNow I'm going to make these fixes.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1695,"cache_read_input_tokens":32637,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1695,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":12,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"01a51414-23dd-441a-b47e-11343d398c1b","uuid":"445c769e-0f64-494d-94e3-adb358a86fba"}

The app is tracking the inventory held of a variety of categorized materials and is broadly similar to an accounting platform.  There is a global set of accounts (inventory, consumer, producer) which can be customized, and within each account there are a variety of materials and their quantity (in customizable units).  Each account / material can be further subdivided into batches where the amount of material in each batch is tracked separately.  Transactions can be recorded and use a double entry system where credits / debits must balance.  Transactions can either reuse batches or create new ones.  newly created batches remember the lineage of batches they were created from.\n     3→\n     4→Pages:\n     5→\n     6→1.

Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks.

I have all the information needed. Let me provide you with a comprehensive summary of my findings.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've found the React components that handle both the edit and create account modals in the InventoryTracker application. Here are my findings:\n\n### Edit Account Modal\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/EditAccountModal.tsx`\n\n**Validation Status:** YES, Account Name validation is already implemented.\n\n**Validation Logic (lines 20-26):**\n```typescript\nconst handleSave = async () => {\n  if (!editName.trim()) {\n    setEditError(\"Account Name is required\");\n    return;\n  }\n  await onSave(editName.trim(), editDescription.trim());\n};\n```\n\n**Validation Display (lines 82-93):**\nThe error message is displayed conditionally with proper styling:\n```typescript\n{editError && (\n  <p\n    data-testid=\"edit-account-error\"\n    style={{\n      color: \"var(--status-error)\",\n      fontSize: 12,\n      marginTop: 4,\n    }}\n  >\n    {editError}\n  </p>\n)}\n```\n\nThe error is cleared when the user modifies the Account Name field (line 78).\n\n---\n\n### Create Account Modal\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/pages/AccountsPage.tsx` (lines 172-269)\n\n**Validation Status:** YES, Account Name validation is implemented identically to the edit modal.\n\n**Validation Logic (lines 60-64):**\n```typescript\nconst handleCreate = async () => {\n  if (!createName.trim()) {\n    setCreateError(\"Account Name is required\");\n    return;\n  }\n  // ... creates the account\n};\n```\n\n**Validation Display (lines 228-239):**\n```typescript\n{createError && (\n  <p\n    data-testid=\"create-account-error\"\n    style={{\n      color: \"var(--status-error)\",\n      fontSize: 12,\n      marginTop: 4,\n    }}\n  >\n    {createError}\n  </p>\n)}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1. **Both modals already validate that Account Name is required** - When the user clicks Save/Create with an empty or whitespace-only Account Name field, a validation error message \"Account Name is required\" is displayed.\n\n2. **Validation approach is consistent** - Both use the same pattern:\n   - Check if the trimmed field is empty (`!editName.trim()`)\n   - Set an error state with the message\n   - Return early to prevent the action\n   - Error clears when the user modifies the field\n\n3. **Error display is styled consistently** - Both use the CSS variable `var(--status-error)` for the error color and display the message below the input field."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a92711eb0aa09c143 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 22205\ntool_uses: 4\nduration_ms: 16018</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"01a51414-23dd-441a-b47e-11343d398c1b","uuid":"c76a5c5a-ef74-4617-a0f1-08373277f171","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"In /repo/apps/InventoryTracker, find the React component that handles the edit account modal.

Here are my findings:\n\n### Edit Account Modal\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/EditAccountModal.tsx`\n\n**Validation Status:** YES, Account Name validation is already implemented.\n\n**Validation Logic (lines 20-26):**\n```typescript\nconst handleSave = async () => {\n  if (!editName.trim()) {\n    setEditError(\"Account Name is required\");\n    return;\n  }\n  await onSave(editName.trim(), editDescription.trim());\n};\n```\n\n**Validation Display (lines 82-93):**\nThe error message is displayed conditionally with proper styling:\n```typescript\n{editError && (\n  <p\n    data-testid=\"edit-account-error\"\n    style={{\n      color: \"var(--status-error)\",\n      fontSize: 12,\n      marginTop: 4,\n    }}\n  >\n    {editError}\n  </p>\n)}\n```\n\nThe error is cleared when the user modifies the Account Name field (line 78).\n\n---\n\n### Create Account Modal\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/pages/AccountsPage.tsx` (lines 172-269)\n\n**Validation Status:** YES, Account Name validation is implemented identically to the edit modal.\n\n**Validation Logic (lines 60-64):**\n```typescript\nconst handleCreate = async () => {\n  if (!createName.trim()) {\n    setCreateError(\"Account Name is required\");\n    return;\n  }\n  // ... creates the account\n};\n```\n\n**Validation Display (lines 228-239):**\n```typescript\n{createError && (\n  <p\n    data-testid=\"create-account-error\"\n    style={{\n      color: \"var(--status-error)\",\n      fontSize: 12,\n      marginTop: 4,\n    }}\n  >\n    {createError}\n  </p>\n)}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1. **Both modals already validate that Account Name is required** - When the user clicks Save/Create with an empty or whitespace-only Account Name field, a validation error message \"Account Name is required\" is displayed.\n\n2. **Validation approach is consistent** - Both use the same pattern:\n   - Check if the trimmed field is empty (`!editName.trim()`)\n   - Set an error state with the message\n   - Return early to prevent the action\n   - Error clears when the user modifies the field\n\n3. **Error display is styled consistently** - Both use the CSS variable `var(--status-error)` for the error color and display the message below the input field."}],"totalDurationMs":16018,"totalTokens":22205,"totalToolUseCount":4,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4454,"cache_read_input_tokens":17073,"output_tokens":675,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4454},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working.
