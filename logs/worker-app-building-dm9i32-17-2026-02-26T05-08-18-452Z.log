Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs).

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\").

Budget information is visible or accessible for each account, including an overall budget for the account and budgets for specific items (for example, big or notable expenses), potentially displayed as inline indicators or links to more detailed budget views.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdjq4Pw1UektSnylW57BEZobPcKpDY4LHifIMz\n\n2. AccountDetailPage (N/A)\n   Description: A detailed view page for a single account that shows all transactions that have affected that account. The layout consists of the account name and category (asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense) at the top, followed by a transaction list or ledger. Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n\n3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n\n4. CreateReportDialog (N/A)\n   Description: A dialog to specify a report based on the accounts and their transactions. The layout likely includes controls or filters for selecting report type (e.g., summary, detailed, category-based), date ranges, and which accounts or categories (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) to include. The page also provides functionality to refresh or regenerate reports based on new parameters and may link back to specific account detail pages when users click on report items. Budget versus actual comparisons are a core feature of these reports.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdH0QZwUJBicXIxYl7ANfnRyzLoKQCwtb1e8Wj\n\n5. ReportDetails (/reports/:id)\n   Description: Details about the contents of a generated report.  The page displays reports that compare actual results to budgeted amounts, both at the account level and potentially at the specific-item level (e.g., big expenses). Reports may be shown as tables, charts, or both, highlighting variances between actual and budgeted figures.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KduvOBXPH0NlcrvAhaRjg7E2zVpwb9xeY8LoBG\n\n6. ReportList (/reports)\n   Description: List of all generated reports and their top level info.  Here is the prompt for generating a report: A dialog to specify a report based on the accounts and their transactions. The layout likely includes controls or filters for selecting report type (e.g., summary, detailed, category-based), date ranges, and which accounts or categories (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) to include. The page also provides functionality to refresh or regenerate reports based on new parameters and may link back to specific account detail pages when users click on report items.

Let me systematically work through all three subtasks.\n\n---\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecAccountsPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in AccountsPage test entries\n\nI'll go through each testSpec.md directive against the AccountsPage test entries (lines 3-139 of tests.md).\n\n**Directives from testSpec.md:**\n\n1. **Systematically inventory every visible element** — test for every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section.\n2. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements** — test for all columns, joins, filters.\n3. **For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result.**\n4. **For user actions that mutate data, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects.**\n5. **Button/control appearance matters** — verify specific text, icons, styling.\n6. **Completely test modal dialogs.**\n7. **Attachment support file uploads.**\n8. **Import/upload dialogs specify data format.**\n9. **Backend integrations include setup instructions.**\n10. **State-changing actions must update other parts of the app.**\n11. **Images consistency** — prioritize consistent nav/styling.\n\nLet me check each test entry in the AccountsPage section:\n\n**NavBar tests (8 entries):**\n- \"NavBar displays logo and navigation links\" — checks logo, 4 nav links, active state, breadcrumb. The spec mentions 4 links: Dashboard, Accounts, Reports, Budgets. But the NavBar code has 5 links: Dashboard, Accounts, Transactions, Reports, Budgets. The test spec doesn't mention a \"Transactions\" link. Let me re-check the test entry.\n\nLooking at the test entry: \"Four navigation links are visible: 'Dashboard', 'Accounts', 'Reports', and 'Budgets'.\" But the actual NavBar has 5 links including \"Transactions\". This is a discrepancy but it's in the test spec vs the component — the test spec should reflect the actual nav links.\n\nWait, the directive check is about whether the test spec follows testSpec.md directives. Let me re-check. The testSpec.md directive says \"Systematically inventory every visible element.\" If the NavBar has 5 links but the test spec only mentions 4, that's a violation of this directive — a missing test for the \"Transactions\" link.\n\nLet me verify by checking the actual NavBar code — yes, line 10 of NavBar.tsx: `{ label: \"Transactions\", path: \"/transactions\" }`. The test spec entry only mentions 4 nav links and is missing \"Transactions\". This is a violation.\n\n- \"NavBar Accounts link navigates to AccountsPage\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- \"NavBar Dashboard link navigates to Dashboard\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- \"NavBar Reports link navigates to ReportList\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- \"NavBar Budgets link navigates to Budgets page\" — specifies exact navigation target. Good.\n- **Missing: \"NavBar Transactions link navigates to Transactions page\"** — the Transactions link exists in the NavBar but no test entry covers its navigation.\n- \"NavBar New Transaction button opens NewTransactionModal\" — specifies button appearance (plus icon, text). Good.\n- \"NavBar displays user name and avatar\" — checks appearance. Good.\n- \"NavBar Log Out button logs the user out\" — specifies redirect to login page. Good.\n\n**AccountsOverviewHeader tests (2 entries):**\n- \"AccountsOverviewHeader displays page title\" — checks title text. Good.\n- \"AccountsOverviewHeader Generate Reports button opens CreateReportDialog\" — checks button icon, text, and action. Good.\n\n**CategorySection tests (6 entries):**\n- \"CategorySection displays all five accounting categories\" — inventories all 5 categories, headers, chevron, totals. Good.\n- \"CategorySection shows correct category totals\" — verifies specific amounts. Good.\n- \"CategorySection expand reveals account cards\" — specifies action and result with chevron rotation. Good.\n- \"CategorySection collapse hides account cards\" — specifies action and result. Good.\n- \"CategorySection Assets expanded by default with three accounts\" — verifies default state with specific account names. Good.\n- \"CategorySection Liabilities expanded by default with three accounts\" — verifies default state with specific account names. Good.\n\n**AccountCard tests (8 entries):**\n- \"AccountCard displays account name and balance\" — checks specific text. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays debits and credits YTD\" — checks specific amounts. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays budget vs actual progress bar\" — checks budget section with progress bar. Good.\n- \"AccountCard View Budget Details link navigates to budget details\" — specifies navigation to AccountDetailPage. Good.\n- \"AccountCard three-dot menu opens actions\" — checks dropdown with actions listed. Good.\n- \"AccountCard click navigates to AccountDetailPage\" — specifies exact navigation. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays savings goal progress\" — checks specific amounts. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays investment performance\" — checks specific data. Good.\n- \"AccountCard displays liability-specific information\" — checks multiple liability cards. Good.\n\n**Violations found for testSpec.md:**\n\n1. **Missing test entry for Transactions nav link** — The NavBar has a \"Transactions\" link, but the test spec only mentions 4 links and doesn't have a test for navigating via the Transactions link. This violates directive: \"Systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target.\"\n\n2. **Test spec says 4 nav links but there are 5** — The entry \"NavBar displays logo and navigation links\" says \"Four navigation links are visible: 'Dashboard', 'Accounts', 'Reports', and 'Budgets'\" but the actual NavBar has 5 links including \"Transactions\".

Per directive 14 (parallel test design), tests that create/modify/delete records must not rely on fixed total count. However, this is checking accounts within the Assets category which come from seed data and shouldn't change from other tests. The test doesn't create or delete records. This is borderline but acceptable since it verifies the initial seed data state.\n\n- \"CategorySection Liabilities expanded by default with three accounts\" (line 245) — same pattern. Same analysis.\n\n**AccountCard tests:**\n\n- \"AccountCard displays account name and balance\" (line 265) — uses `getByTestId` and locator filter. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays debits and credits YTD\" (line 281) — uses `getByTestId`. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays budget vs actual progress bar\" (line 295) — uses `getByTestId`. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard View Budget Details link navigates to budget details\" (line 316) — verifies URL with `toHaveURL(/\\/accounts\\/.+/)` and page content. Good — satisfies directive 1.\n\n- \"AccountCard three-dot menu opens actions\" (line 333) — extracts account ID from testid, clicks menu, verifies options. Good. No `getByText`.\n\n- \"AccountCard click navigates to AccountDetailPage\" (line 358) — verifies URL and page content. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays savings goal progress\" (line 375) — uses `getByTestId`. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays investment performance\" (line 399) — uses `getByTestId`. Good.\n\n- \"AccountCard displays liability-specific information\" (line 418) — uses `getByTestId` and locator filter. Good.\n\n**Overall check:**\n- No `.toPass()` blocks with inner auto-wait calls. Good.\n- No `getByText()` with common words — uses `getByTestId` or `locator.filter({ hasText: ... })` which is fine. Good.\n- No unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach`. Good. No `beforeEach` at all.\n- Generous timeouts on initial page loads (30000). Good.\n- No `.first()` workarounds. Good.\n- Navigation tests all verify URL targets. Good.\n- No `page.goto()` workarounds for missing components. Good.\n- `data-testid` values are consistent with component code. Good.\n\n**No violations found for writeTests.md directives in AccountsPage tests.**"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1592,"cache_read_input_tokens":61840,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1592,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0f74e021-31c7-4459-bb9c-b68d5b5f14d2","uuid":"33d608c4-daa1-4ccd-9cdc-f723c88e6e3a"}
