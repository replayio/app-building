This page is focused on defining and maintaining the standard recipes used in production runs.\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdlrMSeznvLlgzebcKqNs0DmihQTtVZ9rv61UO\n     9→\n    10→2. CalendarPage (/calendar)\n    11→   Description: Calendar view to schedule and visualize production runs over time. The main layout is a calendar (daily/weekly/monthly views) showing each scheduled production run as an event or block. Users can click on a date to create a new production run or select an existing run to open its details page or modal. Each event shows key info such as product/recipe name, quantity, and status. The page includes navigation controls to move between weeks/months, and may integrate data from external inventory and delivery scheduling apps to visually indicate availability constraints (e.g., color coding runs with material shortages). Drag-and-drop or editing of events may be used to reschedule runs. This page is the central hub for planning when production runs occur.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdTvUTHD7IfSRxAhcbzPKXQNjVd4MGOspvJ9t0\n    13→\n    14→3. RunDetailsPage (/runs/:runId)\n    15→   Description: Detailed view for a specific production run.

The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports.

Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3.

This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

Dialog/Modal Components\n\n#### A. New Transaction Modal\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`** (Full file content provided above)\n\nThis modal allows users to:\n- Record new transactions with date, description\n- Add multiple line items with debits/credits\n- Add tags\n- Validate transaction balance\n\n---\n\n#### B. Create Report Dialog\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/CreateReportDialog.tsx`** (Full file content provided above)\n\nThis dialog allows users to:\n- Generate reports with custom parameters\n- Select report type (Summary, Detailed, Budget vs Actual)\n- Set date ranges\n- Filter by categories\n- Include/exclude zero-balance accounts\n\n**Important Note: No dedicated ConfirmDialog component exists in the codebase.** The modals use inline modal-overlay patterns with onClick handlers for closure.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Shared Components\n\n#### A. CategorySection Component\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/CategorySection.tsx`**\n\nUsed for grouping accounts by category (Assets, Liabilities, etc.) with expand/collapse functionality.\n\n#### B. SearchableSelect Component\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/SearchableSelect.tsx`**\n\nReusable dropdown component for account/item selection with search functionality.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Styling Files\n\n#### A. Accounting App CSS\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/index.css`**\n\nContains all styling for:\n- NavBar (`.navbar`, `.navbar-logo`, `.navbar-links`, `.navbar-link--active`, etc.)\n- Breadcrumb (`.breadcrumb`, `.breadcrumb-separator`, `.breadcrumb-current`)\n- Modal overlay and content (`.modal-overlay`, `.modal-content`, `.modal-header`, `.modal-footer`, etc.)\n- Account cards, budget bars, and other UI elements\n\n#### B.

SupplierTracker App Overview\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SupplierTracker/AppSpec.md`\n\nThe SupplierTracker app is designed to manage relationships with suppliers and purchase orders. It includes three main pages:\n\n1. **DashboardPage (/)** - Quick action buttons, upcoming orders list, and suppliers list\n2. **SupplierDetailsPage (/suppliers/:supplierId)** - Supplier information, documents, **comments for notes**, upcoming/historical orders\n3. **OrderDetailsPage (/orders/:orderId)** - Order summary, line items, cost breakdown, documents, order history\n\n### 2. Comments/MaintenanceNotes Components\n\nThe search revealed that **Comments and MaintenanceNotes components are specified in documentation but NOT YET IMPLEMENTED** in actual code:\n\n**In ProductionHub (tests.md):**\n- `MaintenanceNotes` component is documented with comprehensive test specifications (lines 1208-1255)\n- Used on EquipmentDetailsPage (/equipment/:id)\n- Features include:\n  - Add note text input with \"Post Note\" button\n  - Comments list displaying author name, role, date, and text\n  - Reverse chronological order display\n  - System-generated notes support\n\n**In SupplierTracker (AppSpec.md):**\n- \"Comments added for notes about the supplier\" is mentioned as a component in SupplierDetailsPage\n- No implementation code exists yet\n\n### 3. Pagination Components\n\nPagination is **also specified but not implemented as a standalone component**:\n\n**In ProductionHub (tests.md):**\n- Pagination functionality is described for RecipesTable (REC-TBL-13 through REC-TBL-19)\n- Features: first page, previous, next, last page buttons with disabled states\n- Also used in EquipmentTable (EQ-TBL-9 through EQ-TBL-13)\n\n**In InventoryTracker (tests.md):**\n- Pagination referenced for MaterialsPage and TransactionsPage\n- Components list includes \"Pagination\" but no implementation exists\n\n**In SalesCRM (AppSpec.md):**\n- Pagination or infinite scrolling mentioned for ClientsListPage\n\n### 4. Existing Shared Components\n\nThe following **reusable components ARE implemented** in `/repo/apps/shared/components/`:\n\n1. **SearchableSelect.tsx** - A searchable dropdown component used by Accounting and InventoryTracker\n2. **CategorySection.tsx** - Collapsible sections grouped under a category header\n\n### 5. Existing InventoryTracker Components\n\nThe following **working components exist** in `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/`:\n\n1. **RecentTransactionsTable.tsx** - Displays recent transactions with date, reference, accounts, materials, and action links\n2. **NavigationHeader.tsx** - Navigation component with app branding and links\n3. **CategoryFilter.tsx** - Dropdown filter for material categories\n4. **DateRangeFilter.tsx** - Calendar-based date range picker with apply button\n5. **LowInventoryAlerts.tsx** - Warning alerts with severity levels, view details, dismiss, and reorder actions\n6. **MaterialsCategoriesOverview.tsx** - Displays category columns with material listings\n7. **NewTransactionButton.tsx** - Simple button component for creating new transactions\n\n### 6. Shared Layout Components\n\n- **AppLayout.tsx** - Provides app structure with sidebar navigation, header, and main content area\n- **Sidebar.tsx** - Navigation sidebar component\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n- **Comments and MaintenanceNotes** are designed features but need implementation\n- **Pagination** is specified in multiple test documents but needs a reusable component\n- The existing pattern in the codebase uses TypeScript, React hooks, and data-testid attributes for testing\n- Components are modular and follow a consistent structure with props interfaces and functional component patterns\n\nAll relevant files have been provided above with their complete contents."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: aff6d0f8e1c976c38 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 71789\ntool_uses: 44\nduration_ms: 62678</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"06bc99b7-4edc-44af-bd85-349c90079305","uuid":"516435be-8d94-4fbf-b91f-2cada22af450","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the SupplierTracker app and find components related to Comments/Maintenance notes.

Shared Layout Components\n\n- **AppLayout.tsx** - Provides app structure with sidebar navigation, header, and main content area\n- **Sidebar.tsx** - Navigation sidebar component\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n- **Comments and MaintenanceNotes** are designed features but need implementation\n- **Pagination** is specified in multiple test documents but needs a reusable component\n- The existing pattern in the codebase uses TypeScript, React hooks, and data-testid attributes for testing\n- Components are modular and follow a consistent structure with props interfaces and functional component patterns\n\nAll relevant files have been provided above with their complete contents."}],"totalDurationMs":62678,"totalTokens":71789,"totalToolUseCount":44,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2057,"cache_read_input_tokens":68735,"output_tokens":993,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2057},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

So the InventoryTracker has breadcrumb CSS duplicated in its index.css but no breadcrumb component yet. The Accounting app has both the CSS and the component. Both apps have duplicated breadcrumb CSS.\n\nNow I have a clear picture of everything I need to do. Let me start implementing:\n\n## Subtask 1: WriteSharedAppWide\n\n1. **Extract Breadcrumb component**: The Breadcrumb is currently embedded as a private function in Accounting's NavBar.tsx. I need to:\n   - Create `apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.tsx` as a reusable component\n   - Create `apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.css` with the shared breadcrumb styles\n   - Update Accounting's NavBar.tsx to import and use the shared Breadcrumb\n   - Remove breadcrumb CSS from both Accounting's and InventoryTracker's index.css files\n\nBut I'm realizing the Breadcrumb in Accounting is tightly coupled to its own routes and labels, while ProductionHub has completely different breadcrumb structures for its pages like RunDetailsPage and RecipeDetailsPage.\n\nI need to make the shared Breadcrumb component flexible by accepting breadcrumb items as props instead of hardcoding them. For the ConfirmDialog, I don't have an existing implementation anywhere, so I'll need to build it from scratch to handle delete confirmations across RecipesTable, EquipmentTable, and RunDetailsPage. I'm designing both components with TypeScript interfaces—the Breadcrumb takes an array of items with optional paths for clickable links, and the ConfirmDialog will display a confirmation prompt with confirm and cancel buttons.\n\nNow I need to check how the Accounting module implements its breadcrumb navigation to see if it uses the shared AppLayout or has its own setup.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":587,"cache_read_input_tokens":58977,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":587,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"06bc99b7-4edc-44af-bd85-349c90079305","uuid":"bf26347f-87f1-464c-8741-df6acd4533e0"}

The InventoryTracker doesn't use the shared AppLayout either.\n\nLooking at the ProductionHub specs:\n- RunDetailsPage needs breadcrumb: Home > Runs > Run ID (clicking Home navigates to home, clicking Runs navigates to CalendarPage)\n- RecipeDetailsPage needs breadcrumb: Recipes > recipe name (clicking Recipes navigates to RecipesPage)\n- EquipmentDetailsPage needs breadcrumb: Equipment > Details: E-4021 (clicking Equipment navigates to EquipmentPage)\n\n\n- Accounting needs: Home > CurrentPage (clicking Home navigates to /)\n\nSo the shared Breadcrumb component needs to accept a generic items array where each item has a label and optional navigation path, with the last item being non-clickable. I'll create a reusable breadcrumb component in the shared folder with extracted styles from Accounting, then update each app to use it.\n\nActually, I need to think about how to handle the routing logic. The Accounting NavBar currently uses `useNavigate` and `useLocation` to auto-compute breadcrumb items, but if I make the shared component accept props instead, each app would need to handle that computation separately. Let me focus on making the UI component itself shareable and flexible enough to work across different routing setups.\n\nThe core idea is that the shared Breadcrumb takes an array of items as props, where each item has a label and optional click handler. The last item displays as the current page (non-clickable), and everything before it renders as clickable links. For Accounting, the NavBar will compute the items based on the current location and pass them down.\n\nNow I'll move forward with creating the ConfirmDialog as a shared component with its styling.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1221,"cache_read_input_tokens":59564,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1221,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"06bc99b7-4edc-44af-bd85-349c90079305","uuid":"81bf8f5e-51ba-46d8-9ef8-a137e8d8e68e"}
