There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects.

If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type).

The testSpec.md directive says:\n\n> - Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\nLooking at the OrderDetailsPage section, I see these modal dialogs mentioned:\n1. **Edit Order dialog** (OrderSummary - \"Edit Button Opens Edit Dialog\") - tests editing but no Cancel or Validation test entries\n2. **Add Line Item dialog** (LineItemsTable - \"Add Line Item\") - tests adding but no Cancel or Validation test entries\n3. **Edit Line Item dialog** (LineItemsTable - \"Edit Line Item\") - tests editing but no Cancel test entry\n\n\n4. **Delete Line Item confirmation** (LineItemsTable - \"Delete Line Item\") - tests confirming but no dismiss/cancel test entry\n5. **Upload Document dialog** (OrderDocuments - \"Upload Document\") - tests uploading but no Cancel test entry\n\nComparing this to DashboardPage, which has proper coverage with Cancel and Validation tests for its dialogs, and SupplierDetailsPage, which has confirmation tests but lacks cancel/dismiss variants, I can see the pattern of what's missing across OrderDetailsPage.\n\nI need to add seven test entries following the same format as the Dashboard tests: Cancel and Validation tests for the Edit Order, Add Line Item, and Edit Line Item dialogs, plus dismiss for the Delete Line Item confirmation and Cancel for the Upload Document dialog. Let me check the existing test files and Playwright tests to see what's already implemented.","signature":"Eo4RCkYICxgCKkDevGyHzflcIP5ly0fnAFbLlJBEE2M1vimmR/eYODUw030zdSwiwGZ2KLR6uLQrEtWZopEpfR7sCrvVa7U0zGPeEgzeOpwRUoSBbd14f5oaDJQo2kC1YR6ACt3zlSIwJMY/pLBJJWiFfb8ap+bi3Vn+WkkIoc1Tnwxr0xCF6wfJvvkPx+xZf2GTfpX9o9q9KvUP8g8ZZ7q5D+FXdGk7eTa59FeN00c2/17j4CKVHCRwc2siZa/TfLK5BG4eAjTSfcZlT6SNXN62gMDac3ddmBexXQZocF7g3Fqwu5dbTqkHYjsM/VF7Hs0UDi3dFYEI2YMjOAEiKUIH1ULoN0m8LJWMpSHbw7cd7ylWKp8mHjLk/1GSYc8IkYmqSojsIOQM3E/Z7+mbDwA1KDEm4CySMMAvaFhy2a2BIp+Wm8G1nRlw+VlHSkb867JzrGl89VIOcDw+OYobD5yzRwlqRw8OQecnpNPuWw81DcHZthqQoYTxwkjMgjFQPYUh4ItskVZ55DvC034xDatU6I3VEkCzcTTvVaA2bImZptj3iEDw5ABbRBlG3nH+YmqY9zb6TZa0IGiZOURRhdsAzN7UMqrsM7r/orYPBuSDKQfZ2hQdV7G550ysXMvrE0L78vrvUMNsptUoFGT8uMRl1QaJX4E0GJ7guPCauh7f9GeIDgopvpUonnNFjHXqq9gjfHiAiRn/XmSTq9O6INd+TozWnRmIoEEWnCYDFI5DmJCjK3aonP7bvti6XwrA5XeXVSwr58+DVeo8zms151Wh0fczJM3fWdNqeZb2nKcG3vCRAttz5aYp8HGXJZTFbcl+HrhsXAU2qiaOcuxNakCNSnBwfq+ntEdTrOUNsFVMWxrKhqhRYrU7QNzooy6Un4KoqYKbA2NmI/rYV76N/TMENoZjIObf3M7ruvCukVhs+mWTbqiDH+sh0d2mpA3q7ZRC877O7/4ZPfFBnc2jrzkHHvQoBlc5d9CrQ918jdH5PtobEuWog3ldVzIdrj0BEAn3rG6rJfih1OAgjER3EOiyo/cq0hg+mACT5Q0lhqx9sJWkWDO3cRcppZIn6RkujFT9GYhNOdAb45bCVNm9k8LY+8SB//ivtvfpfW8VUvkQlhk2nWS5DbQSjUvCPqg04ETavzSFtx3YsK/o7trCr21rYR1BxawxdmpEXWZfU5b5ZszSkR0DpZcG6c8ADDgE7xO+fnZl0eM7orQgbM1FEUDO+IY+avoYdj068vX+RHRMn/0lsXyNqDZUecbnuvLq9VYxOWlBNfVXuvCXsjG8Ea+9eAGds4mOKWQTzOwPk+Uw5riWkJ1VHzDT1+QqkLi7hgsDCo76DUcKoLUFF/56RIaW1ny1wXTEObrLwTTvt2yWSojAaQ0cgJKBMMx57AhXkV6bLVh/kAZziZVh2LF4IeFf5odnvqe5QNKCRt4d3i5AjhMP/aAeCSjnyI7rsx+won9zfvLVi8AzcEKB7gmouSJEEDRDUluXJAMYqutjO8gfXy51koh/3KSE6bWAAkLFA4KXnOgAv0RsGsbUNc3zTMZ36N0DFj8IDokR9DovwC4ivjVJ/KT2b42Q3Z4AowPfk4t18jEazk2tlJvzoHvEmAXG9K1MzSLhuSBCOVlyNUY6vZZQSqvZYKpSh1Xb+Zyrwy7x+60sHrCCuhggHrZB7F7ZS73f4x8LfPU1MaSAlwFg8efCDKoglf7ny+I2PKe/PW5GCpyjbFRx8YxSwLI3Oe1/U+hOHYxt/ME5ZYN6jXZFvyhbsqafL6r8eDxKQNB/TxzDvlqDjvipzKv6q+6QbiAcrB9lATbgtwlEsLszQ+khTwSfdzgxNafga+54GNoFPlNNfujzL1X0LAxIVIlFS4OLwug5Bz2B5vOOeRXp4SCcscJ1KiOp7FjgGN0Pt7Xy97y34bJUwLBh7rpDQEbxqepzKw119/b6f0orvd4m1vGelKtVLDCpBqSQbrGvwy9iMcJeEAb1Ma/k7MDdHqqckXz9BwWMy2Vr4tRhqUH4w/KxUwpxT1IkG00T9fV4p1DWzi9MEdjcW/IqVEfTGYFgjcrvJNKZ75mocLzAghgRwfSdAbFZ80lEKA5/R7mcRoNwCsF9tyj6WpljCNWo2BOro6TpVEdWbOx8mv9V4B2ob4JRyrERIkBNbR9z0uSzA0VRSU10FD9k9CJ0CykDdth8V77c5TcQWgeQg3i6bh/XEuZY6hdNV3BFny1vOScJcygvZbZu9mHeR3n77jJhiHai0eKFCbitfo98j8zv/+f3d3CMF9lsW68W/6F3gObwDCM0YiRzopoc2MBKKsAbcZPEY+1xA5de8BDoP/rzdvYJly5y2AzEIbK6JOfBhaoqqpmSHx7fIAUtVM3bLT5wT8O2BgyBCVPyaXEtmMNGEGR5Hg/ByAqM6qamUL+uGXR9vg8rFGT0uezcPb7DOckLHExh8E+GGWQ7YZWLAYGMoofs7CWbybyov93qL7b+zZ70OoTN7Yac/pJnxgtPPnazu8u8Ac2ZKVrQQMvpab7hC3o/5Avx5JgUzHXiq2e7LGSA+k6m5Xv6KCOdlwj18V6AHNsjSBw/iXA4Tu4/mumSM9evE1ooRcpDl9MdR9IwGkP+YxU1464/zVqykeM+VU8nnyS9/DOifKJBQzyB1qc9VyqZkk9VbGjgVk8KPqNoGSkQOagAvtPoxAZoR+V6+5yV7ahIUXJHpBYWvIxU0ClRQN4wU56fqYVsOIrU4fBuFMdv9i3m45zisFAZQM6FnmpgyBroB2M/wfOmBHCITjC8BwNz6XxtRbCGwKxdmoh5cL3dXdVxjFqTBwrw1hr0Oeh6O0Luai+6gdDok6OWOgGLZ+sZIzhoQFiBI7BqqP/0o+Qy7h0BAkbRNoXgR4+cR63V1UVMlV7HulbStITCq/4U5NJXaCDGGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":12119,"cache_read_input_tokens":29805,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":12119,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d216819b-faa2-42bc-af7b-45c8c6721713","uuid":"53ccd856-4f2a-420d-b8c6-ca11947de866"}

Let me enumerate the missing test entries:\n\n1. **Edit Order dialog Cancel** - The Edit Order modal has a Cancel button (`data-testid=\"edit-order-cancel\"`) and close button, but no Cancel test entry in tests.md\n2. **Edit Order dialog Validation** - The Edit Order modal doesn't have explicit validation (it's just status and date), but looking at the subtask description it says we need this. However, looking at the code, the Edit Order modal doesn't have required field validation... Actually, the edit order form has both fields pre-filled (status from order, date from order), so the only validation would be that the status field is required. \n\nLooking at the pattern from the Create Order Dialog Validation test, I should add a validation test that ensures the Expected Delivery field can't be cleared and saved—that's the most meaningful validation for this modal.\n\nNow I'm re-reading the subtask requirements more carefully. There are seven specific test entries I need to add across different dialogs: Cancel and Validation tests for Edit Order, Add Line Item, and Edit Line Item dialogs, plus a dismiss test for the Delete Line Item confirmation and a Cancel test for the Upload Document dialog. Let me map out what needs to go into tests.md for each section—starting with OrderSummary where I'll add the Edit Order dialog tests after the Print Button entry.\n\nFor LineItemsTable, I need to add four new test entries covering the Add Line Item dialog, Edit Line Item dialog, and the Delete Line Item confirmation. Then for OrderDocuments, I'll add the Upload Document dialog Cancel test. After updating the test documentation, I'll need to implement the corresponding Playwright test cases in the spec files and add test references as JSX comments next to the relevant Cancel buttons. I should also check the ConfirmDialog component to understand how the dismiss button is identified for testing.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3788,"cache_read_input_tokens":69146,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3788,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d216819b-faa2-42bc-af7b-45c8c6721713","uuid":"b262f29f-6827-4436-9d02-9320fbe25772"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first.

This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

When `tsx` runs the script, it uses Node.js ESM resolution, which doesn't fully match bundler resolution for this package. The `@neondatabase/serverless` package exports `neon` from the `.mjs` file, but the package.json has `\"import\": \"./index.mjs\"` and `\"require\": \"./index.js\"`.\n\nLet me look at the version more carefully. The issue might be that in version 0.10.4, the ESM module doesn't export `neon` properly when resolved by Node.js native ESM.\n \nInteresting—the direct import works fine with `npx tsx -e`, but importing through `schema.js` fails. The `.js` extension in the import path is causing tsx to treat the file differently, switching to native Node.js ESM resolution instead of tsx's own enhanced resolution.\n\nThis might be a pre-existing issue unrelated to my changes. Let me check if tests have run successfully before, then try a workaround to get the tests running.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":496,"cache_read_input_tokens":112930,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":496,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d216819b-faa2-42bc-af7b-45c8c6721713","uuid":"dbea3c48-b210-45a1-8140-210e52ebf472"}
