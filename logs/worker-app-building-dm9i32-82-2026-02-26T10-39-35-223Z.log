No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`).

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings.

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it.

Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout.

Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Let me also check the auth backend to understand the full flow.\n\nLet me now systematically go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecResetPasswordPage\n\nI need to check the testSpec.md directives against the ResetPasswordPage test entries in docs/tests.md.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images consistency - navigation/styling prioritized over exact mockup adherence\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\n3. Don't substitute easier-to-implement elements \n4. For every clickable element, test entry must specify exact navigation target or action result\n\n\n5. Any user action that mutates data needs test entries verifying persistence and side effects\n6. Button and control appearance matters - verify text, icons, styling\n7. Completely test modal dialogs\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must have tests for other parts updating (timeline, etc.)\n\nNow I'm checking each test entry against these directives. Looking at the ResetPasswordPage test entries starting around line 2360, I can see the first entry describes the page heading and instructions.\n\nThe next several entries cover the password input fields with their labels and placeholders, the submit button with its text, and then the critical flow where matching passwords succeed and trigger auto-login with a redirect to /clients and the sidebar displaying the user's avatar, name, and sign-out button. The mismatched password case shows the validation error and form persistence, while empty fields also trigger validation without making an API request. For token issues, there's coverage for both invalid tokens showing an error with a link back to forgot-password, and missing tokens showing an error message.\n\nI'm also checking that the loading state appears during submission and that the forgot-password link is available on error states, navigating to /auth/forgot-password. Looking at the directives, I need to verify that every clickable element has its exact navigation target specified—the submit button goes to /clients, and the error links go to /auth/forgot-password. I'm also systematically inventorying all visible elements: heading, instructions, password inputs, confirm password input, submit button, error messages, and the forgot-password link. For the password reset action itself, I should verify that the data mutation persists and any side effects like auto-login are accounted for. mutation. The test entry verifies the user is auto-logged in and redirected. It says \"the password is updated successfully\" and \"automatically logged in\" and redirect to /clients with sidebar showing user's avatar/name/sign-out. This seems adequate.\n\n**Directive: Button and control appearance matters**\n- Submit button text \"Reset Password\" is specified\n- Loading state \"Resetting...\" is specified\n\nLooks good overall. Let me check for anything I might have missed...\n\nActually, let me re-read the test spec entry for \"Invalid token shows error message\":\n\"Given the user navigates to /auth/reset-password?token=invalid-or-expired-token, or the token has already been used, the page displays an error message (e.g., \"This reset link is invalid or has expired.\") and a link to request a new reset (navigating to /auth/forgot-password).\"\n\nThe backend can return different errors depending on whether the token is invalid, expired, or already used, and the component checks for all three cases. The test entry groups them together but correctly specifies the navigation target, so that works fine.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the writeApp.md directives for the reset password component itself. I need to verify the test entries are satisfied, match the visual mockup, ensure all interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes, and review the remaining directives.\n\nLooking at the ResetPasswordPage component, the root element has the auth-page class and reset-password-page test ID...\n\nbut I need to verify whether auth-page actually provides the required p-6 max-sm:p-3 padding. The ResetPasswordForm has proper test IDs on all interactive elements, but the key question is whether the page-level padding directive is being satisfied by the existing CSS class or if it needs to be added directly to the component. Looking through the test files, I don't see any dedicated tests for the ResetPasswordPage itself, which violates the directive requiring email-based auth flows to have dedicated tests exercising the production code path. I should search more broadly to confirm there aren't auth flow tests elsewhere that I'm missing.","signature":"EtA9CkYICxgCKkCSrjrti6U3S7BYrgWKRMoKUNEK1cNV4BXPC6iiKqHUm/ybSej9PAH43zGgxTOWjbNoJLURHHZRkE9RHM+RcmrnEgxaE7gg8E3wcay/5mgaDHjuuVwJGmgKlm00YCIwVZD8SOEv5CwpnkMoopF0u+u6gYWl8BbSgkVMzRSL62rA8T22xKH8PEad+ESpSJS2Krc8SKDGwUxteO2kt4ySVL37GpKuQHdEjpTQQBsjYcaXZTYSde9tzvCyo9cKhsIMjsykWsQBStzP03Hk0bK4tULujARQSMgJi30w2UeD1SQCb2giAmbL+XBplN5ShPrmzyUdvQ6YL+QF+fcxysT/K7EBZ0PMkOrb5wk4S+RMrE3POlarL9Jf7QaI1QKrWvHWvTObmTgd9hJfPKeFPoR6ESzLMFIqJScKCDHkTz259z3MAD0noafUc+RHJzC3eCVIgwjVCA3N9aTHv2/a2t93mT++wmTFWmy69oW3Z/UQg0btZmiw6BENNHqOuyL2RX+Z7J3cb+JnBWS4LihoKoCQIGdvkzqeGtDXxle07Z7XC422tdf7YJ5DXKGytlGoVez7QaWgXqJ8XJ1z9gqcyFznt9qI4e+MPn6f1zULFXratlJA41RNPVkrYCqJp5rFW9adkFeMAffTsDI6/Op0T250lNzuIN1DhsUd41466ltEO3W6XQXoKz2KRdfgoMIOKF+h6AgJmQGFGG7tjqIjlJMvrJQmFO0aGVtQj0MLRy2XmKE2oJldvPrFnJCetQEakaFpwmeAmSG8/qZqJuCsrIExLc8NQAoyxpsPE5VMgK3zUJcHXjTqCdlUGX0ega6LaSVZoUMhiAkqEYlcf7mtQu5aAdAvWPgVcMazRpIV8BzQHci3httItLRnGEImMgsOh5esjEn5QvG4geJrtnMqVbtBCgtKbLo+XHsNLNxMjJrQiqFldRyfqigL3nRHCeRmMyrsDcyqFY0hBBjgoNMPhaK1XgnQz5DGXUwnDhhO0MIc23o3QZT5+puoar4HbsiC2ZDBiqpplYsoN291soklEIY1q13rEydIeyA73ZND9jIKECh4XYqAsJ5Xw1Wggy8uN7E0mWeKFglquQULVJuWE5tJU8yf6W+dXSr3aETiUW/5LlY+a8dhhNAu5hHahAiBmdG/ffLaEuPUqGItLAqU0MfI53cXSObTj/KDwjZEpUkVSrYZYZO2u53Lv5gCyfwtpokY68D6LcgehjbLRw21zvzHb0eXUa7ScQvNtjIY0BTxQ00BG+bJcpbiZsT8SAJCpCyjtjeWmpZWYQdp7p9cC9MzTk7Sl2LzEGwYZWrzgrO9MeIzaBaiVXt6ktZao4mW7d9PHNKvvQVIAiIFUBTBtLiW6l0u8LOKENSSPSZhFrDcL1DgQg6ZhBT6xJ3dV6KDjxk9MGCavuCgpkENihT7wp+gTIT2DHvwCXey6CdOx8BfjlRpZMCe4P3kr1akpDQmnU1zwqmBztRloboK6GmYWGXHFTHHA8W2xPIqJnDkmSgga254ruaTiqsDitlbPiLIzFbLvxbgYhtRQlgZD4qblOjq3omH77LRwdTbczdWoU5T9xGjvDDl8d57WjfZzdPCGXBnFuOIYvcuJDh9m635M9WH3LwbxREslpo5UTc1Ag7AfjYO3bUb0JUpXAgoew7wwLJOV/Q7AOD12hQ8QGo2+xCkvl80gQhI1F60LkCDFoVY8yHqWhDUwS8qEcy5s5PYdvsune3jUxtr9dmfM+l2lzit8Lk65xIi7fqC6QxUKbH8Eh3qLlY4mHD+jssLj0bRzBxG9vmWYYw5j4x0ty3FhGiSX0Y/Difq8sWB1+OI9Ws6D9CwmQdMKkmNjlqjLDoW6dJD9fvTlgVH6xpiNrEH1ldae08sKxvZCiy8xiqNUJACTfzD9dVPF3JZSpiALnMNX76nByFxRtu18DWuc+sMSoCktig1ZMLhggNgMhyQ6iM37oXU/tpvhojQ9ZwLxKphwSTWPmlGaiMQ3lxjUpBLva20putdX27ifbPb+9H813K/mVm0GwuaKhysrdULRusXDH04wKYCgm5hU8SX+La+p6kM7xqs5NB79M4USBjIDMpR1l2peZFdI5AXPFbiUD58q3h96JQfGjToFJTaNvBsJY2rsB24bp2MYrXiZaiP3Y+QIcqQICkQ/HpmLpxuO8ah9IvgkReCtWpCTtPLXpN/iunuw3+oqA+Rrp+MzzkLrrEBkLqHbFYtq2H5xQc0/LCm2Vv2f+XRRrOh6FbMobJ6L7DqDZHe8j6/dIi/WI39OHe/QOuzxtA4HM3YQbMan+KIpR5fVjXDXQJhD27skyqhUt0WEOSAhZlMY/hQ55Obh0ev7i4kkVMsYjmbU2drBx5x2HLgbR101w7q5TGqQESNESRsPzV+xxOcXZlC1YO0nbmAYsakxKppUHoy3W9QGanwpASIFR7OfQLPLRvvkpsCvSvU5BbLs8FFEiaxGLJZqBKW7vNYu5brAFKB9bs2cFVfIwmo4fF6jBPnp5kXSCR4uBtCn0w8q8ltVf9yCeCMOL/9M+6Hu49JuYKn1MIaCoHMQmt5yqLsAQkBjgRCsi5H00yiti1lqDdKeJN9ChIF0zdaN9vgFP4GMBAVkMKrDMqdLFUnIJgVKE9UkR+zlTJeLmmOW1QXCqS2Xu21cj6mL7spfVV8FoiC7Te/FYkTsUOWyoQxNeT8Nryl+oGO4pzxBshaG5DD3sGDabMK0gE+rUrJx4HzXAOc4ZvqhbXqZpcO/TuMPnvQ312BqdRH9twDp+rKw7pfqdvRz8WAu30OaBPmEa5jXnwHUXoLnwYhfRE2SF4BRimFMRSWgncvEDJrbVQ958he8Eyw9mEgTwgVaAn5k6C0piOtntG30NGl9z69HcT76344HS0Fdg5JEtTa+M39XoiqqRr2FUywz9LELbNUP7SUxaexHLcgHwxgCdrC+UViHkxYkemaUD8UBVDzYW9scj3dPMqj7+DCAaPpVDhdTA+MdJ2sA1EQa9YrOyfAJd1DBBj/8OjH5z1ECPsfUQ4lnhvsFeCTLuu5NWRkgDbwFgQyhx11oRZK5a8z7oZwfXxKkDpnOwqayecLQqn3y/cNWCj9aAA1iI/2fOPwhTEAWQHDhNC7s/0XXSVwq+feL1rAL6UhCLjz93I4fFyfQmPJU5qgl86fn7F8Lih8e4CyjQJVl0v72DDJimEtf0OZ8ZhMrS/YaX2Mlaf4dUGK6adWWYncMlGSVkq29r+gXKDSOS+rqg4bw+ikeyqVTN30n0BhTZXTBLntRokWaIiL3vSSbbgOvGBnXFQhFRysRRmdXIKbZXMetNSYsg3eEM4yiRDBrxiZn4v92myMGfXxFwuQtZePqI6Zn2EPItthdglL2B986cHdQSoeg0VyhWNgzCuzBRJp5k9RFwLj4tp553uicX5UnEt+xs8AjwgWRVPG3oJPapo0CyHvrr6nVs+zioEgOCr7OL1tKo/s/gMBygB99QilAKQCGRXCjxS8N9DChj0/q8zMZGHDhDi+ecOzmkwLVHuctdQYnsYKMKVNgKoOQKN5PA9dhi2T0QH5g1WadUYr3qfz4E1+Xb+n9CDb/3sh8S9TQMy6kw+YJcwERNHEeH67aZ/QRFdVWglCu1rr8gtzclCl7y1c0EHq+00BEP42JazWj5R6u0ZxD5MvFRt2OOOi8320ku39Nra5qnuzF+/hM2g3GbZQ9h59DCjVXCoEXBV3vDqxmYQUSK92gYK5StTiN7sfzFQMJkPZ8QNPwnw2SZdNieIrw4qTIQBESEXrV7b9pANFRZgqHPUmO4Znca2kIFdpvIpWvnlR9cvCYLmSmvdLrtUIV/EdvxjltMzPFN48Y04UBpqya9uJnNlxSHuR5mPYaGlmx8auNIYnY1LymmkZVthMhIkCfBdWxKUN/XQiaRzlRXeqlmcUAYMaJd1bgeAJXfI0hDmPP4szCSZrwqGoewJbYROVmBBxxoR+9xyEZ5mMCRWzEOkHRgzzoh9wU4AOerEn7sqjXemHyrF7kZPVDMtpPz38nzpD/6Lz2j6PXF96gE1oxOXEsND2px9I2uO3KmESL0K5Rhq6Sebq/QhE0E45of8bhcgw70mm15rl7YTzHKLABUDvtEmK5XX5QcAxq7dwtwDF8US6Sp8ykPykK/MUS1J9Fnn0M02jd9XYymQrHeHST68W4192MLzsvLLiqV3xm6snIF8VlQ/Sg+FRmAf1vPHGq7qCahh/G5Q3h5tiA8yjX+di/gZJW2hNqz6+oOkWcSYYhggn7mybbkgCNrHW0rLapXpz3GrCqSNfoXjwAeI7Q3xzYiMA6W2of4gwImQab84hWpQeUsSfnYKiolJLRvMwkG6Gqjo/vgU/hW5tCF0olbPXNbrzonxWmjI93IYZnveJUDS7zRr+VTUYmzRVqZO7ogZ4mjS6jA09H2NWy17YVOXKTZOtlGFDY2vAgyz1bWgUjQKA6Cmby9oKAXGHBQaBsYSENvbCSTOgCrRcLDLSp2Y3WB+u3ZfL+iJogp9A0FCIQszXq2UFk05j6cPaQ2kIozxJ3CcZ7kVN3TELgxrczIjBkjRaGWi9RJ8JggpdVGnow2kMLq/iDG7r6e/3KhLxOVj2BLVTFmc75CNgZ1WHQlb9giCtfLjqNz6iSqFloqyl2zLzavuE/HX0ffIZ9vcYM1XN/fnAanry2W1jJmRg+/3qYlDjZSqwJz7j+cxWMmhIYtR5Dvdz3xmxj6L4A4GMfmcvAhv3jJ3vdlH+jUqXX+GixjcIz3vJ6Y4KxoQHMQiJLFkOyMLGnFzY7VDp0ra5KZapsI0WcPu/f/bqIfZ4Ia5vsAjUsn9UeFJwaEl3hqWubBLx/2PjquDvI0cd/oXUZl256lcHoqmzkQaUh+7QccOM7CKe4mqOZLEDIKeuFvuPPLhOzystA7Ln9m3UlNzKRCv7gn01ivJayYEWLYYxb6NaLhhso2Lkc/PKWNwTaGc+K

Now let me read the ForgotPasswordPage test entries to compare style/format.\n\nThe auth pages (ForgotPasswordPage, ResetPasswordPage, ConfirmEmailPage) use `className=\"auth-page\"` instead of `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. But looking at the CSS, `auth-page` has `padding: 24px` (which is equivalent to p-6) and the media query gives `padding: 12px` for small screens (equivalent to p-3). So the padding IS present via CSS, just done differently (CSS class vs Tailwind utility). \n\nHowever, the writeApp.md directive specifically says: \"Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\"\n\n\nThe directive is specifically about using Tailwind classes `p-6 max-sm:p-3`, not just achieving the same padding through CSS. While the auth pages do have consistent padding via their CSS class, they're not following the stated approach. The directive explicitly mentions centered layouts for auth forms, so this seems like a case where I should flag the inconsistency even though the visual result is equivalent.\n\nLet me check what the ForgotPasswordPage tests look like to understand the current implementation better.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2010,"cache_read_input_tokens":55226,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2010,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d607f75b-fe6e-4367-b0ab-000567f35704","uuid":"6a74c9f3-c61b-4528-aa90-b20359c8fef8"}

Let me also check whether the AppSpec.md has anything specific about the ResetPasswordPage.\n\nActually, let me now go through each subtask systematically:\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecResetPasswordPage\n\nGoing through each testSpec.md directive against the ResetPasswordPage test entries:\n\n**Directive 1**: Images of different pages might not have consistent styling or navigation elements. Prioritize consistent navigation/styling.\n- N/A for the test entries - they describe behaviors, not styling. ✓\n\n**Directive 2**: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup.\n\n\n- The test entries cover all the key elements: form heading, instructions, password inputs, submit button, and various error states. Everything visible in the component is accounted for. ✓\n\n**Directive 3**: Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\n- The page is straightforward (just a form), so this doesn't really apply. ✓\n\n**Directive 4**: For every clickable element, test entry must specify exact navigation target or action result.\n- The submit button test specifies the redirect behavior when passwords match and login succeeds. ✓\n- The forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password in both error scenarios (missing and invalid tokens). ✓\n- Mismatched passwords keep the form visible for correction, and empty fields prevent the API call entirely. ✓\n- All interactive elements have their outcomes clearly defined.\n\n**Directive 5**: For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying change is persisted correctly and exactly the right side effects occur.\n- The password reset mutation is covered—the test confirms the password gets updated and the user is automatically logged in with the redirect to /clients.\n- The backend also marks the token as used, which the invalid token test case implicitly covers.\n\n**Directive 6**: Button and control appearance matters: specific text, icons, or styling.\n- The submit button text is specified as \"Reset Password\" in the normal state and \"Resetting...\" during the loading state. ✓\n\n**Directive 7**: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n- This page has no modals, so this doesn't apply. ✓\n\n**Directive 8**: Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\n- Not applicable here. ✓\n\n**Directive 9**: Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.\n- Not applicable here. ✓\n\n**Directive 10**: Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions.\n- Not applicable here. ✓\n\n**Directive 11**: State-changing actions must have tests for other parts of the app updating.\n- The password reset does change the password, and the test confirms auto-login works afterward, but there's no explicit test verifying the user can sign in with the new password on a fresh session. That would be more of an integration test across multiple pages though, so it's probably fine to leave that to the Sidebar tests.\n\nThe token being marked as used gets tested indirectly through the invalid token scenario, which seems sufficient for a page-level spec.\n\nOverall, no violations found—the test entries thoroughly cover all page elements and interactions with clear navigation targets and expected outcomes.\n\nNow I'm moving to Subtask 2 to review the ResetPasswordPage components against the writeApp.md directives. Starting with Directive 2, I need to verify each test entry maps to actual component behavior—like checking that the heading and instructions are rendered correctly. I'm verifying the remaining test cases: invalid tokens trigger an error message with a conditional link to the forgot password page, missing tokens show an appropriate error, the submit button displays a loading state while processing, and error messages conditionally display the forgot password link based on specific error types. I also need to ensure all interactive elements have proper `data-testid` attributes for testing. I'm checking the remaining directives against the component—database queries use proper Neon syntax, no native select elements, no attachment handling needed, and I'm verifying each guideline is either implemented or correctly marked as not applicable to this reset password form.\n\nFor directive 14 on consistent padding, the auth pages achieve the same `p-6 max-sm:p-3` spacing through CSS classes rather than Tailwind utilities, which is functionally equivalent even if it diverges from the standard approach used elsewhere. padding.\n\nNow I'm checking the ResetPasswordPage tests against the writeTests.md directives. There are no test files for ResetPasswordPage at all—only sidebar.spec.ts and deployment.spec.ts exist. The directive explicitly requires dedicated tests for password reset flows that exercise the real production code path without the IS_TEST bypass, so this is a clear violation. Let me re-examine the exact requirement to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly.\n\nThe directive specifies that tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true, call the actual endpoints, query the database for generated tokens, and verify the full flow works end-to-end. Since no tests exist yet for ResetPasswordPage, I need to determine whether this counts as a directive violation or just a missing test that hasn't been written. The directives govern how tests should be written, so technically they're not being violated if no tests exist—but the absence of tests for a critical auth flow is definitely a finding worth

Let me systematically go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecResetPasswordPage\n\nThe ResetPasswordPage test entries (lines 2360-2398) need to be checked against testSpec.md directives.\n\nTest entries:\n1. \"Page displays heading and instructions\"\n2. \"New password input field is displayed\"\n3. \"Confirm password input field is displayed\"\n4. \"Submit button is displayed with label\"\n5. \"Submit with matching passwords succeeds and auto-logs in\"\n6. \"Submit with mismatched passwords shows validation error\"\n\n\n7. \"Submit with empty password fields shows validation error\"\n8. \"Invalid token shows error message\"\n9. \"Missing token shows error message\"\n10. \"Submit button shows loading state during request\"\n11. \"Link to forgot password page is available on error\"\n\nChecking directives:\n1. ✅ Consistent styling/navigation - auth pages use consistent auth-page styling\n2. ✅ Systematically inventory every visible element - heading, instructions, password inputs, submit button, error messages, forgot password link all covered\n3. ✅ Don't substitute easier elements - N/A for this simple form\n4. ✅ Every clickable element spec\n\nNow I'm verifying the navigation targets are exact: valid submission goes to /clients, the forgot password link points to /auth/forgot-password, and invalid attempts keep the user on the current page with an error displayed. I'm also checking that password reset success triggers auto-login and updates the sidebar to show user info, confirming the state changes persist correctly. The button text and loading states are specified as \"Reset Password\" and \"Resetting...\" respectively, and there are no violations against the testSpec.md directives.\n\nMoving to the ResetPasswordPage components, I need to verify they match the writeApp.md requirements. The data-testid attributes are properly set on all interactive elements: the form container, page wrapper, password and confirm inputs, and submit button all have their corresponding test identifiers. message: `reset-password-error` ✓\n   - Forgot link: `reset-password-forgot-link` ✓\n5. ✅ Monorepo base in netlify.toml - N/A for component code\n6. ✅ Neon tagged template literals - No DB queries in component\n7. ✅ Empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID - N/A\n8. ✅ Netlify Functions path index - N/A\n9. ✅ Searchable select for entity references - N/A\n10. ✅ No duplicate navigation links - N/A\n11. ✅ No native HTML <select> elements - No select elements used\n12. ✅ File-type-specific attachment icons - N/A\n13. ✅ Attachment file upload - N/A\n14. ✅ Consistent padding p-6 max-sm:p-3 - The `auth-page` CSS class applies equivalent padding values that match the Tailwind utilities.\n\nNo violations found for writeApp.md directives. Now I'm checking the test requirements for ResetPasswordPage. The critical directive requires dedicated tests for email-based auth flows that run against the actual backend without the IS_TEST bypass, ensuring real token generation and storage are exercised.\n\nSince there are no test files for ResetPasswordPage at all, I need to determine whether this counts as a directive violation or simply an incomplete implementation. The task is specifically asking me to check existing tests against the directives, so if no tests exist, there's technically nothing to validate against the requirements yet. the absence itself could be flagged.\n\nLet me check if there are any existing ForgotPassword or ConfirmEmail tests too...\n\nLooking at the test files, there are only `sidebar.spec.ts` and `deployment.spec.ts`. No tests for ForgotPasswordPage, ResetPasswordPage, or ConfirmEmailPage exist.\n\nThe sidebar tests include a \"Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password\" test, but no actual reset password or forgot password form tests.\n\nSince the writeTests.md directive requires auth flow tests and these are completely missing, that's a violation I need to flag. The task queue doesn't show any existing writeTests tasks for these pages either, so I should add a fix task to address this gap. I'm realizing there's already a task queued to check the ConfirmEmailPage tests, so I should add a corresponding task for ResetPasswordPage since it's also missing test coverage for its auth flow. Looking at my findings, the test spec and components pass their checks, but the tests themselves don't exist—which violates the writeTests.md directive requiring dedicated tests for auth

Both component files have proper `data-testid` attributes on all interactive elements, satisfy all test entry requirements, use equivalent padding via the `auth-page` CSS class, and follow all applicable writeApp.md directives.\n\n3. **CheckTestsResetPasswordPage**: **1 VIOLATION found** — No test files exist for the ResetPasswordPage. The writeTests.md directive requires dedicated tests for password reset auth flows exercising the real production code path (without IS_TEST bypass).
