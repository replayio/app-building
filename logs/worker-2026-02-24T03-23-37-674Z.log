The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it.

The PersonDetailPage:\n1. Has a section in `tests.md` with components listed but NO test entries\n2. Has NO page component in `src/pages/`\n3. Has NO components in `src/components/`\n4. Has NO test files\n5. The DealDetailPage and DealsListPage also don't have page/component implementations yet\n\nSo the PersonDetailPage hasn't been built at all. Now let me systematically go through my three jobs.\n\n### Job 1: CheckTestSpecPersonDetailPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations\n\nLooking at the PersonDetailPage section in tests.md (lines 331-339):\n\n\nThe spec defines four main components—PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, and AssociatedClientsSection—each with specific UI elements and functionality, but there are no actual test entries written yet, just a placeholder comment indicating they'll be added later. I see the issue now — the test entries haven't been created yet because the PlanComponent jobs for PersonDetailPage haven't run, so technically there's no existing content to violate the directives. The real question is whether the absence of test entries itself counts as a violation, or if I should wait for the jobs to complete before evaluating compliance. test entries IS a violation - the directives say to systematically inventory every visible element and write test entries. The components are listed, which means the page structure was planned, but the actual test entries were never written.\n\nI should add a fix group for this. Let me check what a reasonable approach would be...\n\nActually, wait. Looking at this more carefully - the CheckTestSpec job is to check for violations IN the existing test entries. If there are no test entries, there's nothing to check against the directives. The violation is that they're missing, which is more of a \"work not completed\" issue.\n\nLet me think about what the right approach is. The strategy says:\n\"During each checking job you need to read the strategy document and all the directives, and then go through all the documentation / code you are checking to look for violations of those directives.\"\n\nFor the test spec checking, the docs/tests.md IS the documentation being checked. The PersonDetailPage section has components listed but no test entries, which violates the directive to systematically inventory every visible element and write a test entry for each one - this is a clear violation I should fix by adding the missing test entries.\n\nNow for CheckComponentsPersonDetailPage - since no components or pages actually exist for PersonDetailPage, there's nothing to check against the writeApp.md directives about how components should be written. The directives specify things like requiring `data-testid` attributes and other implementation details, but I can't verify those if the components don't exist in the first place.\n\nFor CheckTestsPersonDetailPage - similarly, no test files exist, so there's nothing to check against the writeTests.md directives.\n\nThe core issue is that PersonDetailPage hasn't been built at all. I need to create fix groups for this work, but I shouldn't do the work myself - I should queue it up for future workers.\n\nLooking at the strategy more carefully, I should use `add-group` to create fix groups for violations. Since the fundamental problem is that the page structure doesn't exist yet, I need to think about the right order: test entries should be added first following testSpec directives, then components following writeApp directives, then tests following writeTests directives. I'm realizing that violations of writeApp.md and writeTests.md don't really apply here since the code hasn't been written yet—those directives are about *how* to write code, not whether it exists. The actual violation is in testSpec.md: PersonDetailPage lists components but has no corresponding test entries, which breaks the directive to systematically inventory every visible element.

[2026-02-24T03:21:44.154Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01NGEhkK6P4VyDPZNVA1w65K","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have the full picture. The PersonDetailPage (page 3 in the AppSpec) is clearly specified but:\n1. Has components listed in tests.md but NO test entries\n2. Has NO page/component code\n3. Has NO playwright tests\n\nLet me also check if there's a mockup image I should download and look at. The mockup URL is `https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd6tTJNxrn27SvXDfJANF0dzKcZECW1mhuabTM`.\n\nHowever, the testSpec.md tips say \"Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch.\" and to use curl. But I shouldn't need to download the mockup for checking directive violations - I just need to check the existing test entries against the directives.\n \nNow I'm going through each job systematically. For the CheckTestSpecPersonDetailPage job, I need to verify the PersonDetailPage test entries in tests.md against what testSpec.md requires. Looking at what's currently in tests.md, I see the section header for PersonDetailPage with 4 components listed, but there's just a placeholder comment saying test entries will be added later—no actual test entries exist yet. The directives in testSpec.md require me to systematically inventory every visible element from the mockup, including column headers, filters, buttons, icons, and badges.\n\nChecking against the testSpec requirements: there are no test entries at all, which violates the directive to write a test entry for each element. The requirement to specify exact navigation targets or action results for clickable elements is also violated since nothing's been tested. The ContactHistorySection and RelationshipsSection both have Add Entry and edit capabilities that need mutation test entries verifying data persistence and side effects, but those don't exist. Button and control appearance verification is also missing—no test entries are checking for specific text, icons, or styling as shown in the mockups.\n\nModal dialogs like the Add Entry modals and filter dialogs have no test coverage either. The reciprocal nature of relationships means contact history entries should appear on both sides, but there's no test verifying that state-changing actions propagate correctly across the app. The core issue is that PersonDetailPage has zero test entries, and the PlanComponent jobs were never actually executed to generate them.\n\nI need to create a fix group addressing this gap. Since the entire page is missing test entries, the fix involves writing them out systematically for each component. The standard pattern would be a FixViolation job followed by RunTests and DocumentFix, but given the scope here, I should structure a fix group that generates all the missing test entries across the page's components.\n\nNow I'm checking what writeApp.md directives apply to PersonDetailPage. Since the components don't exist yet—no PersonDetailPage.tsx, PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, or AssociatedClientsSection—I can't validate directives about test entries, visual matching, or data-testid attributes.\n\nMost directives are either general infrastructure rules or component-specific checks that don't apply without the actual code. The only one I can verify is whether the navigation sidebar contains duplicate PersonDetailPage links.\n\nThe real issue is that PersonDetailPage components don't exist at all—the page hasn't been built yet. This is a missing implementation rather than a violation of existing code, so I should note this separately and add it to the fixes

The PersonDetailPage:\n1. Exists as a placeholder route in App.tsx (line 31): `<Route path=\"/individuals/:individualId\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Person Detail\" />} />`\n2. Has no actual page component (just a placeholder)\n3. Has components listed in tests.md but NO test entries\n4. Has no component code\n5. Has no test files\n\nNow let me systematically check each job and document violations.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecPersonDetailPage\n\nChecking PersonDetailPage section in tests.md (lines 331-339) against testSpec.md directives:\n\n\nThe tests.md file lists four components for PersonDetailPage—PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, and AssociatedClientsSection—but there are no corresponding test entries for any of them, which is a clear violation of the test specification requirements.\n\nThe core issue is that the PersonDetailPage components themselves were never built, so there's nothing to test against. I need to create fix groups to write the missing components first, then add the test entries, and finally write the Playwright tests to validate them all. or group them? The strategy says \"Group related fix tasks into a single FixViolation job when they share the same root cause.\"\n\nThe root cause for ALL three violations is: PersonDetailPage hasn't been built. But the fixes are sequential - you need test entries before components, and components before tests.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. These are not just \"directive violations\" - they are \"missing implementation\" issues. The checkDirectives strategy is about checking EXISTING documentation/code against directives. But here there's nothing to check.\n\nLet me re-read the strategy: \"During each checking job you need to read the strategy document and all the directives, and then go through all the documentation / code you are checking to look for violations of those directives. You must do this systematically and announce each entry name / file you are checking.\"\n\nFor Job 1 (test spec): The documentation exists but PersonDetailPage has no test entries, which violates the testSpec directives. For Job 2 and 3, there's no actual code or tests to check - these are missing implementations rather than directive violations. So I should report Job 1 as a violation with a fix group to write the test entries, then handle Jobs 2 and 3 as separate implementation tasks since they don't fit the directive-checking pattern. But the strategy says to group related fixes by root cause, and all three stem from PersonDetailPage not being built yet. all share the root cause of \"PersonDetailPage hasn't been built\". But the fix process is sequential. Let me think about the best grouping...\n\nActually, the testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md are different strategies. The fix groups should reference the appropriate strategy. Let me structure this properly.\n\nActually wait, looking at the strategy again: fix groups use the checkDirectives strategy:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\" \\\n  --job \"FixViolation: Fix <violation description>\" \\\n  --job \"RunTests: Verify tests pass after fix\" \\\n  --job \"DocumentFix: Document the fix\"\n```\n\nThey all use the checkDirectives strategy. So I should create fix groups within that strategy.\n\nFor the test entries violation, I should add a group that writes all the missing test entries. For the components violation, I should add a group that builds the page. For the tests violation, I should add a group that writes the tests. These are substantial pieces of work, so I need to break them down carefully.\n\nI'll structure it as three fix groups: one for the missing test entries across all PersonDetailPage components, one for building PersonDetailPage and its subcomponents, and one for writing all the Playwright tests. should probably be separate groups since they depend on each other sequentially.\n\nActually, I'm overthinking this. Let me just add the fix groups and move on. Let me create:\n\n1. A fix group for the missing test entries (testSpec violation)\n2. A fix group for the missing components (writeApp violation) \n3. A fix group for the missing tests (writeTests violation)\n\nWait, but the strategy also says to add RunTests and DocumentFix jobs. Let me follow the pattern.\n\nHmm, but for testSpec violations, there's no \"RunTests\" or \"DocumentFix\" needed - it's documentation changes. And for the components, the tests haven't been written yet so RunTests doesn't apply.\n\nLet me simplify. The key violations are the missing test entries for PersonDetailPage, the unbuilt components, and the unwritten Playwright tests. Since all fix groups use the checkDirectives strategy, I just need to describe what each group fixes. For the test entries, I'll add a FixViolation to document the missing entries. For the components, I'll add a FixViolation to build PersonDetailPage and its subcomponents, plus a RunTests to verify they work. For the tests, I'll add a FixViolation to write the Playwright tests. entries\n- RunTests: Verify PersonDetailPage tests pass\n\nI need to reconsider the ordering here. Groups 2 and 3 depend on Group 1 completing first, so I should queue them in the right sequence. Since `add-group` puts items at the front by default, I'll need to add them in reverse order—Group 3, then Group 2, then Group 1—so Group 1 ends up at the front of the queue. Alternatively, I could use `--trailing` to append them in order.\n\nActually, thinking about this differently: each fix group should be self-contained enough that future workers can execute it independently with the right context. Looking back at the violations, the testSpec directive violation is clear—test entries are missing. But the missing components and tests aren't really violations of the writeApp.md or writeTests.md directives themselves; those directives describe how to write components and tests, not that they must exist. The only concrete directive violation is in testSpec.md where test entries should be present but aren't.\n\nSo I'll focus my fix groups on the actual violations and the incomplete implementation. Group 1 addresses the testSpec violation directly. Groups 2 and 3 address the incomplete app and test coverage, which are implementation gaps rather than directive violations per se, but they're still necessary for a functional build.\n\nI'll add these groups in reverse order to the queue so they execute in the right sequence. I'm realizing I should consolidate the test entries into a single fix group since they all stem from the same root cause—the PlanComponent jobs never ran for PersonDetailPage. The missing components and tests follow the same pattern, so I'll group those separately too. Rather than treating these as isolated fixes, I should structure them as rebuilding the page through the proper pipeline: testSpec generation, then app writing, then test writing.\n\nSince the
