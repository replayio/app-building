Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it contains subsequent changes to the spec from bug reports and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

Let me systematically work through the three jobs:\n\n1. **CheckTestSpecUserDetailPage**: Check testSpec.md directive violations in UserDetailPage test entries\n2. **CheckComponentsUserDetailPage**: Check writeApp.md directive violations in UserDetailPage components\n3. **CheckTestsUserDetailPage**: Check writeTests.md directive violations in UserDetailPage tests\n\nLet me start with Job 1 - checking testSpec.md directives against UserDetailPage test entries (Section 10 of tests.md).\n\nThe UserDetailPage test entries are in Section 10 of tests.md (lines 1242-1289).\n\n\nNow I'm reviewing the testSpec.md directives that apply here: prioritize consistent navigation and styling over exact image adherence, systematically test every visible element in the mockup including headers and controls, and don't substitute simpler elements for what's actually shown—if the mockup requires computed columns or joins, test for those rather than replacing them with easier alternatives.\n\nFor clickable elements, I need to specify exact navigation targets and action results without ambiguity, and for data mutations, verify both persistence and side effects. Button appearance matters too, so I should test the specific text, icons, and styling shown. Modal dialogs need complete testing, attachments should support file uploads unless indicated otherwise, import dialogs must specify expected data formats, and any configurable backend integrations need to be tested.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the UserDetailPage test entries against these guidelines. The page has a header with back button and user info, a deals section listing user-owned deals, a tasks section for assigned tasks, and an activity timeline. I'm checking whether the existing test entries cover all the required components and interactions thoroughly.\n\nLooking at the header tests, UDP-HDR-01 covers the name, email, join date, and summary stats, but I notice the avatar isn't explicitly mentioned in the test description. For the clickable elements, I need to verify that UDP-HDR-02 properly specifies the navigation target when the back button is clicked, and I should check if the activity section tests cover all the client link navigation requirements.\n\nNow I need to examine the actual UserDetailPage component and its sub-components to see what's being rendered and compare that against the test coverage requirements. I should also look at the AppSpec to understand what elements are supposed to be there, then move on to checking the component implementation itself.","signature":"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

Let me work through the three jobs.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecUserDetailPage — testSpec.md directive violations in UserDetailPage test entries\n\nThe UserDetailPage test entries are in Section 10 of tests.md (lines 1242-1289).\n\nComponents:\n- UserDetailHeader: Back button, user avatar, name, email, join date, summary stats (Active Deals, Open Tasks, Total Deals)\n- UserDealsSection: List of deals owned by the user with name, client, value, and stage badge\n- UserTasksSection: List of tasks assigned to the user with completion status, title, client, and due date\n\n\n- UserActivitySection: Recent timeline activity by the user\n\nThe test entries cover header display and navigation, deals and tasks sections, and activity events with client navigation. Now I need to check each testSpec.md directive against these tests, starting with whether every visible element in the mockups has been systematically inventoried.\n\nLooking at the UserDetailHeader component, it displays a back button, user avatar, name, email with icon, join date with icon, and three stat cards for active deals, open tasks, and total deals. The UDP-HDR-01 test verifies the header shows user name, email, join date, and summary stats with the back button visible, but it doesn't specifically test the avatar display or validate the actual stat card labels and values. The UserDealsSection heading and content are cut off, but I need to continue examining what elements are present versus what's actually being tested.\n\nThe UserDealsSection shows a heading with deal count, deal rows containing name, client name, formatted value, and stage badge, plus an empty state message. UDP-DL-01 tests that deals are listed with name, client, value, and stage with proper navigation, though it doesn't verify the section heading format or empty state behavior. For UserTasksSection, there's a heading with task count, task rows with completion indicators, titles that strikethrough when complete, client names, and due dates, plus an empty state. UDP-TSK-01 tests the basic listing and navigation but misses the completion status display and strikethrough styling.\n\nLooking at UserActivitySection, it has a \"Recent Activity\" heading with a clock icon, activity events showing relative dates, descriptions, and client name links, and an empty state. UDP-ACT-01 and UDP-ACT-02 cover the heading display and client link navigation, which seems sufficient.\n\nNow checking the directives: I need to make sure no easier-to-implement elements are substituted for what the mockup shows, and that every clickable element has its navigation target specified. The deals section, tasks, and activity all look properly specified. Going through the clickable elements — back button to /users, deal links to /deals/:dealId, task links to /tasks/:taskId, and client links to /clients/:clientId — all have their targets verified in the test entries. I should check if there are any data mutations that need testing.\n\nThe page appears to be read-only with no mutations, so that directive doesn't apply. Looking at button and control appearance, the back button styling and stat card labels could use more specific testing. There are no modals or state-changing actions on this page.\n\nReviewing my findings, I notice UDP-HDR-01 doesn't mention the avatar display even though the component description explicitly calls it out — that's a gap in the inventory of visible elements. I'm also spotting an incomplete thought about UDP-TS that needs finishing.\n\nLet me re-examine the test entries more carefully. UDP-HDR-01 covers the user name, email, join date, and back button, but it's missing verification of the avatar itself and the individual summary stat labels and values like Active Deals count and Open Tasks count. Similarly, UDP-DL-01 lists deals by name, client, value, and stage with navigation, but I need to check what else might be missing from that section.\n\nLooking at UDP-TSK-01, it covers the task title, client, and due date with navigation, but there's no mention of task completion status indicators or priority levels. UDP-ACT-01 shows the Recent Activity heading and lists events with dates, descriptions, and client links, but doesn't specify how empty states are handled.\n\nNow I'm checking the testSpec.md directives more carefully to determine which of these gaps are actual violations versus acceptable omissions. The spec asks for a systematic inventory of every visible element in each mockup, so I need to assess whether these missing details represent incomplete test coverage or just reasonable simplifications.\n\nThe component description explicitly mentions completion status for tasks and an avatar in the header, but UDP-HDR-01 doesn't verify the avatar, and UDP-TSK-01 doesn't check for completion status. These seem like the clearest violations of the inventory requirement. The summary stats in UDP-HDR-01 are mentioned but lack specificity about what exactly should be verified—whether that's just the labels, the actual values, or both. I'm identifying the specific violations where test entries don't match the directive to inventory every visible element — the summary stats cards need their individual labels and values verified, the task completion status indicators aren't being tested, and the user avatar in the header is missing from the test coverage. Now I'm checking the UserDetailPage components against the writeApp.md directive requiring `data-testid` attributes on all interactive elements and containers that E2E tests need to target. Looking at the test references, the stat cards and individual activity items aren't being tested yet, so missing testids there might be acceptable for now—though I'd need to add them if more detailed tests get added later. For the component abstraction directive, I see that UserTasksSection still needs to be extracted into its own file like the other sections. ✓ (separate file)\n- UserActivitySection ✓ (separate file)\n\nAll JSX is properly abstracted. ✓\n\nNow I'm checking each test requirement against the implementation. The header displays the user's name, email, join date, and summary stats with a working back button that navigates to /users. The deals section shows deal names, clients, values, and stages with proper navigation links. Tasks display titles, clients, and due dates with correct routing. The activity section renders the \"Recent Activity\" heading, events with relative timestamps and descriptions, plus client name links that navigate correctly. All client links route to the right detail pages.\n\nEverything checks out against the spec.\n\nI'm verifying the styling aligns with the mockup requirements—button variants, icons, badges, and section layouts all match what's specified in the components and tests.\n\nNo native select elements are being used for filters, and attachment functionality isn't relevant here.\n\nNow I need to check if components are layout-agnostic without outer padding. The UserDetailHeader has a margin-bottom class on its root element, which violates the directive about not including layout-related spacing in component roots. The UserDealsSection and UserTasksSection roots don't have padding or margin, which is correct. I should verify the rest of the sections follow this pattern. I'm noticing UserDetailHeader has `mb-6` on its root element, which violates the layout-agnostic directive — the parent should control spacing instead of the component itself. Now checking the color and database directives: the components properly use CSS variables for domain-specific colors like `bg-accent/20` and `bg-status-active`, and the backend correctly uses tagged template literals with the neon driver and doesn't write data that would need null conversion.\n\nFor the Netlify Functions path parsing, I need to verify the userId extraction logic — when the path `/.netlify/functions/users/abc123` is split by `/` and filtered to remove empty strings, it becomes `[\".netlify\", \"functions\", \"users\", \"abc123\"]`, so index 3 correctly captures the userId.\n\nNow looking at the UserDetailPage components against the writeApp.md directives, I found that UserDetailHeader violates the layout-agnostic rule by including `mb-6` margin on its root element. I should also check whether the stat cards are missing required `data-testid` attributes for E2E testing. has `mb-6` margin — violates layout-agnostic directive.\n\nNow I'm checking the Playwright tests against writeTests.md to see if they're properly verifying navigation. Looking at the test assertions, I can see they're checking URLs after navigation actions, which is what the directive requires. Let me trace through each test case to confirm they're asserting the actual page content or URL changes rather than just checking that click handlers exist.\n\nAll the navigation assertions are in place and properly formatted. For side effects, there aren't any mutations on this page to test. I'm also scanning for problematic uses of `getByText()` with common words — the tests are using `toContainText()` instead, which is safer.\n\nNow I'm verifying that all the `data-testid` values are consistent across the test files: `users-page-header`, `users-grid`, `user-card-*`, `user-name-*`, `user-detail-header`, `user-detail-name`, `user-detail-back`, `user-deals-section`, `user-tasks-section`, `user-activity-section`, `user-deal-*`, and `user-task-*` all align with the actual components. I'm also checking that no `.toPass()` retry blocks are wrapping Playwright locators, and confirming the tests don't depend on fixed record counts.\n\nThe assertions look good—they're using relative comparisons like `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(5)` and checking for specific records by name rather than relying on exact counts. No hardcoded database IDs are present, and the test titles match their corresponding test entries.\n\nNow I'm verifying the remaining test titles against their directives. All of them line up correctly—from the users page header and card display tests through to the user detail page navigation, deals, tasks, and activity sections. Everything checks out.\n\nI'm reviewing the directive about using data-testid attributes for identifying elements. Looking through the tests, most are following this pattern correctly—they get elements by testid and then check their content. But I'm noticing one issue: the activity section test uses a CSS selector to find client links instead of relying on testid attributes, which suggests those activity item links might not have proper test identifiers assigned to them. Looking at the UDP-HDR-01 test more closely, it's checking for the header with user details like name and email, plus a back button, but it's also verifying that the deals, tasks, and activity sections are present on the page — which goes beyond what the test specification actually requires.\n\nMore importantly, the test doesn't validate the actual email text, join date, or summary stats values that the test entry explicitly calls for. The test only confirms these elements are visible, not that they contain the correct data. This is a gap between what the test entry specifies and what the Playwright test actually verifies.\n\nI'm noticing the same pattern across other tests too — UDP-DL-01 claims to verify deals with name, client, value, and stage, but only checks for one deal name. UDP-TSK-01 says it lists tasks with title, client, and due date, but only validates the title. UDP-ACT-01 is supposed to verify activity events with date, description, and client name, yet it only checks for the section header. These are all significant gaps between the test entry requirements and what's actually being tested. tests are much shallower than what the test entries require.\n\nLet me look at the specific violations across each job. In the spec, the header component is missing avatar verification and doesn't detail the summary stats labels and values properly. The task component description mentions completion status but the test doesn't check for it. The app has a layout violation with the margin utility on the root component. And in the tests themselves, there are several gaps: the header test skips email, join date, and summary stats; the deal test only checks the name; the task test only verifies the title; the activity test doesn't validate the actual events; and one test uses a CSS selector instead of a data-testid attribute.\n\nNow I need to decide which violations to prioritize. group into fix jobs. Let me think about what are related fixes...\n\nActually, let me re-evaluate. Some of these testSpec violations are somewhat subjective. Let me re-read the testSpec directives:\n\n\"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\"\n\nThe user avatar IS a visible element (it's prominently displayed). The completion status checkboxes ARE visible elements. These are clear violations.\n\n\"Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\"\n\nThe summary stats have specific labels that should be verified.\n\nSo for fix groups, I think:\n\n1. Fix testSpec violations (update docs/tests.md entries):\n   - UDP-HDR-01: Add avatar verification and detailed summary stat labels\n   - UDP-TSK-01: Add completion status verification\n\n2. Fix writeApp violation:\n   - UserDetailHeader: Remove mb-6 from root, add spacing in parent\n\n3. Fix writeTests violations (update playwright tests):\n   - UDP-HDR-01: Add email, join date, summary stats checks\n   - UDP-DL-01: Add client, value, stage checks\n   - UDP-TSK-01: Add client, due date checks\n   - UDP-ACT-01: Add activity content checks\n   - UDP-ACT-02: Use data-testid instead of CSS selector + add testid to component\n\nThe testSpec and writeTests violations are interconnected — updating the test entries means I'll also need to update the actual tests, and the data-testid issue requires changes in both the component and test file. I'll create fix groups:\n\nGroup 1: Fix testSpec entries and shallow tests\n- FixViolation: Fix UDP-HDR-01 missing avatar/summary stats details in test entry and test\n- FixViolation: Fix UDP-TSK-01 missing completion status in test entry and test\n- FixViolation: Fix shallow UDP-DL-01, UDP-ACT-01 tests that don't verify required content\n- FixViolation: Fix UDP-ACT-02 to use data-testid instead of CSS selector\n- RunTests: Verify tests pass after fixes\n\nActually, the strategy says to group related fix tasks by root cause. Let me reconsider the underlying issues: test entries lacking detail, Playwright tests that are too shallow compared to their requirements, missing data-testids on interactive elements, and a component layout violation. Reorganizing around these root causes, I should update the test entries first to be complete, then fix the tests and components to match those requirements, and finally address the spacing issue in the parent container. I'm realizing I should follow the strategy more closely and group fixes by their root cause rather than creating separate groups for each violation. Let me consolidate: one group for the test-related fixes since they're both about test coverage depth, and another for the layout margin issue since that's independent. I'm seeing more test coverage gaps across the remaining test files—missing verifications for deal details, task attributes, and activity content, plus a selector issue in one test.
