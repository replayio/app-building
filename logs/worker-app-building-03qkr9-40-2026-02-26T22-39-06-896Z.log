No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips).

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored.

This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`.

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

[2026-02-26T22:34:18.495Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_014Dbq2dCnqqMydJfutcHtMd","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"I've read the DashboardPage test entries (lines 1-247). Now I have all the DashboardPage test entries. Let me also get the full list of directives from testSpec.md, writeApp.md, and writeTests.md, which I've already read.\n\nNow let me systematically check the DashboardPage test entries against the testSpec.md directives. Let me list the directives from testSpec.md:\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. I need to avoid substituting simpler elements for what's actually shown in the mockup — if there are complex columns requiring joins or computed values, I test for all of them, and if there are four filter controls, I test all four rather than just the easiest ones.\n4. Every clickable element needs a specific navigation target or action result, with no ambiguity about where buttons lead or how external flows like OAuth or payments open and complete.\n5. For any user action that changes data, I need to write test entries that verify the change persists and that exactly the right side effects happen — like history entries being created once, not duplicated.\n6. Button and control appearance matters too — if the mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that appearance exists, not just that some button is there.\n7. Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they work properly.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format with required columns and accepted values, and tests should verify that format documentation is visible before the user attempts the import.\n10. Any backend integrations the user can configure — webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps — need complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n11. State-changing actions require tests to confirm they work as expected.\n\nWhen I perform a state-changing action, other parts of the app need to update accordingly. If there's a timeline or history feature, every mutation the timeline tracks must create a history entry. If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships, creating or updating one side must automatically update the other.\n\nNow I'm going through the DashboardPage test entries systematically. The NavigationHeader tests look solid — they check that the header displays branding and all navigation links with correct appearance and order, each link navigates to the right page, and the active link is visually highlighted. The clickable elements specify exact navigation targets and visual appearance is verified.\n\nLooking at the LowInventoryAlerts section next...\n\nThe alerts section displays with heading and warning icon, each alert shows severity, material name, current quantity, and reorder point. The View Details link navigates to the material detail page with exact target specified. The Dismiss button removes the alert and persists that dismissal across page reloads. The Reorder button opens a new transaction pre-filled with the right navigation target. There's also an empty state test. One thing I'm noticing — the Dismiss button test checks persistence on reload, but it doesn't verify whether this dismissal is reflected elsewhere in the app, like whether other sections that might reference these alerts update accordingly. The Reorder button test specifies the navigation target but I should check what happens next.\n\nLooking at the MaterialsCategoriesOverview tests, the section displays with heading and icon, category columns show name with total items and units counts, and each category displays a sample of materials with names and quantities. Clicking a material name navigates to the detail page, the View All Categories link goes to MaterialsPage, and the overview updates when a category filter is applied — all of these look solid.\n\nFor the RecentTransactionsTable, the table displays with correct column headers and transaction rows show the right data. I'm checking the multiple transaction scenarios now.\n\nThe transactions appear in reverse chronological order, the View Full Details link navigates to TransactionDetailPage, View All Transactions goes to TransactionsPage, the table updates with date range filtering, and there's an empty state handled. Moving on to the DateRangeFilter, which displays with label, date range, and calendar icon — clicking opens the date picker and selecting a new range updates all dashboard widgets. The CategoryFilter shows as a dropdown defaulting to \"All Categories\", lists all categories when opened, filters dashboard content on selection, and resets when \"All Categories\" is selected. Finally, the NewTransactionButton displays prominently with a plus icon and clicking it navigates to NewTransactionPage.\n\nNow I'm checking whether every visible element and clickable component has been accounted for with clear test coverage. The DashboardPage components all have test entries, and I'm verifying that navigation targets are specified precisely — though I notice one test entry mentions the app could navigate to NewTransactionPage or open a modal, which leaves the exact behavior slightly ambiguous. Looking at the state-change directive, the dismiss alert test doesn't verify that other parts of the app update in response, though that's probably not necessary since dismissing an alert doesn't actually mutate data elsewhere. For the modal directive, the \"navigates to page or opens modal\" language is ambiguous about which behavior occurs, but since NewTransactionPage is a separate page, this seems acceptable as written.\n\nNow I'm checking whether button appearance is properly tested—most controls have styling checks covered, so that looks fine. Let me reconsider those two \"or\" cases more carefully to see if they're actually problematic. The Reorder button and NewTransactionButton both say they either navigate to /transactions/new or open a modal, but the spec doesn't clarify which behavior is actually expected. I'm focusing on checking whether the test entries violate the directives about specifying exact navigation targets, rather than comparing them to the mockup. I've identified two potential violations so far: the LowInventoryAlerts Reorder button and NewTransactionButton both use \"or\" language that leaves their destinations ambiguous.

In other parts of the app (AccountDetailPage, MaterialDetailPage, TransactionsPage), the NewTransactionButton navigates to /transactions/new without the ambiguous \"or opens a new transaction modal\" phrasing.\n\nSo the DashboardPage has the ambiguous wording in two places:\n1. Line 89 (LowInventoryAlerts Reorder): \"The app navigates to the NewTransactionPage (/transactions/new) or opens a new transaction modal\"\n2. Line 245 (NewTransactionButton): \"The app navigates to /transactions/new (NewTransactionPage) or opens a new transaction modal\"\n\n\nThe other pages like AccountDetailPage, MaterialDetailPage, and TransactionsPage all consistently describe the same action as just navigating to /transactions/new without the \"or opens\" ambiguity, which violates the testSpec.md requirement for unambiguous navigation targets. I need to update those two DashboardPage entries to match the consistent pattern used elsewhere.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking all the test entries against the directives. Looking at the NavigationHeader section, all seven tests properly specify either exact navigation targets or visual appearance checks, so they're all compliant.\n\nMoving through LowInventoryAlerts, most tests are clear, but the Reorder button test has an issue—it's ambiguous about whether it navigates to a new page or opens a modal, which violates the specificity requirement. The MaterialsCategoriesOverview section is starting to come into view, and I need to continue evaluating each test entry the same way. I'm continuing through the test checklist for the remaining components. The RecentTransactionsTable tests all pass, covering the table display, data ordering, navigation links, filter interactions, and empty states. The DateRangeFilter and CategoryFilter components also check out with their appearance, interaction behaviors, and cross-component state updates working as expected.\n\nNow I'm hitting a violation in the NewTransactionButton tests—the second test has ambiguous language around whether clicking the button navigates to a new page or opens a modal instead. This same kind of ambiguity showed up earlier with the DashboardPage tests, so I'm seeing a pattern of unclear navigation targets that needs to be resolved.\n\nLet me also verify if there's an AppRevisions.md file I should reference, and check whether the state-changing actions directive applies here. Looking at the DashboardPage actions: dismissing an alert changes state but doesn't really cascade to other components like the materials overview or recent transactions table, so that seems fine. The filter actions do affect multiple sections though, and those tests already cover the cross-component updates. So the main violations I'm finding are just these ambiguous navigation targets.\n\nGoing through the remaining directives—styling consistency, element inventory, modal dialogs, import/upload specs, backend integration, and attachment functionality—none of these really apply to the DashboardPage, or I can't fully assess them without the mockups. The two navigation ambiguities are the real issues, and they stem from the same inconsistent phrasing about opening modals, so I should group those together as my findings.","signature":"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

When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code\n3. Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything that E2E tests will need to target\n5. In a monorepo, add `base = \"apps/AppName\"` to `netlify.toml`\n\n\n6. Use tagged template literals exclusively with the neon serverless driver, handle empty strings as null for DATE, TIMESTAMP, and UUID columns, and parse Netlify Functions paths correctly\n7. Build modals with searchable select dropdowns when referencing other entities, avoid duplicate navigation links, and never use native HTML selects for filters\n8. Display file-type-specific icons for attachments, ensure actual file upload support, and apply consistent p-6 padding to all page root elements (p-3 on mobile)\n\nNow I'm going through each component file to check for any violations of these guidelines.","signature":"ErAMCkYICxgCKkACyagUx1MJe5aW9OWft2O+2se4b8IA6cpe+fWqN6+KP3XWtWJ5a2c/1rhydMrUbma5wEU5KLlT3TtiwoHOuL1MEgzUdcieowagx1hdYG0aDF9B+D5dXv7jv+dGOSIwDhfwytXgKrivYU/a2qZIabmgJj76pWrZw1hmubdQI++tGEDsJu8f3IGRQwAWblOXKpcLkMX/XS/EMTDhuZQb+eOV5RPN7uEUuneGTeKF94QerqL6I9RF6+QdqJYHyf2eb+QE7ZHpvCijgwGaNLeyk8LpCNwfIWRmNoIrwN9ASvOFp7xbkT1NHmzhjImGxOQ39yAuMgpUh6eZhvj5n490zzvsgNxgt2qm4uRe1sMI7VwdKsWUpKVHtGG7i77ixylkuFUCPbID3up8orNLkkfOFsJ/h6UfJeKmNaAFYpf2MuFgEhHR5zS5nru0viiJ+ujeNBv4MaFou/btTqXDK9fsYGV9sjXRf9Zwx6GleJ92mef20z2idsIxc/9QyTv8E/5mz4258mVJnFp2ArpAdOCkeeO5C4TVvqFgnrsfokCD7jHe8G+jxrj4K2zrzsUYcI4MNYwIKCgoNebEYV56ctiMT8HMy/uIAd2uX3yrdg0jQWTukHcAar2zJlpIpzoBhRFFhUeQXE75bJ5lk6ZhOisIz+ewUAIZ/w8hbQGWZgKrolCV/BxISiXf0x7FJQnI9SLzqck4vMLf4vp9wYIt3hWu6BnHjj7w/kpyDJm0/+oZabvusMUwmiPuCkMoGpnixJ+Qpaye3Te1W+v78PAwDVFjWxfLe0HP2hSvrldSlTroQP4BFz9vrtOUzXPuIfwJf3N74tqtE/6RZGe5EOoMRrNgK+ZICCkz9CKlLnhkORUz/0kIRD88SNb5cj1FmYrwylSF7DimAiJuOZfITPLrzQ9xhIcO3J38xyAu8bxqXo8CeTXqqq3MeKD8M1/s9Vb3XD2CIAVvaWVKHjhF3H8UO3Dbnrp86DZuVYy+qT6jvxe3hBcoPy9zac/2ZbMsk+sqJ05+chFmrvR5X4XFAqoXUZ8GhkSnf/RgIhd4VvXn6wZVRbJ6PyxzldwPNML4A1mr487nJ786TbOqAk9sy/rGmQG8KHCoIsI/jnQKq8NWdrCxKoYIJ7RBRKouH5Q8U6ZpE08LOKM85WAlrIe3aZ4qZhDIIaT4ilgHJ00Oe5bD+zYj0RwGDjMae/smuVw7zHvW2XRpM4ld33LKxR8CkJUhrMzQ4WFtUL3P/AKCcRTIDvr4iqbsEDDwjzcpB2f6/NtepGKZl2ECuksZj6e+PK631wjClPLs9dJjLJzbGle+h+5E7ljFq6AEn281twJt2zLV4c8NmzWCyvmSf5yfBu5g7nM675sCEL8w/C+986RqUONuVoDGEPF+a89M26W7I4MoYXZvHE351sdi4XiFpB+v27DCOymwcWOYza7Yd/1Z1N2x1BdrEMVv2YeGD2KyE3jGp8Z68bnZ+ZLbmZjTu5yaTLeDTHQE9x2LfcLhWy8Wgt+PhTshGliHLJ/GGfYAnT9glIdg0YOIrACCkvgtp94TVr207vund+b7QoYGq+YiZ/JqWlYOnJQbOVIlCEyFZ6Q/EaAtLv0GzqkMF6UATGTQARE8ByGqzHhIXXurJbAvwNH4OpVANDTGLUw7f8ChmIXIdtoMrUzaqtOcwLXwUDUJU/bSdR88mtPNbYl823lHwHc6r20LCloYfpcAKvXKKWB4vD6hP0fWuFwEaG9axT3V/krkE+sayT96nUPY7lWY+KVwZPTbcRku3rOYXmRfEuOe2ISUMKjgPJouPl6kTwsak6bEMhVAy5foJRuarmhQjFb3ANaBdppJHZZ8KQT/r5Tzo87GElgloebnD5KrtYzBsZ9vQMT+RiJR/v1R6qTW9uaYEOkcha5PA3CiDq7ZHAio8SaDDt4tFgCejC4t/AfzsxbOAJt6O8ps9qMSSzUnXxLVOtBl+53/E4pBmcdbHZStVeCAeJm5spSqtJC536byr7pEA/sp8jyhxrtnfIOd/3fpQVCV4MZo4e6lZiWPHYCG4+BQ6NQEa03kV7nGn20TKqXrPky3Le4fCWG1e0Ome6yixQpA+j95qQKCwWkpGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1016,"cache_read_input_tokens":53142,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1016,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"04e18173-e856-4b87-8200-3abf51f35f89","uuid":"27b80d6f-c303-4bf4-9279-ae9f9aa4d79f"}

Let me check each component.\n   \nMost of the remaining directives in writeApp.md don't apply to frontend components—they cover backend database handling, Netlify configuration, and serverless driver syntax. The one frontend-specific guideline I should verify is whether any modals use searchable selects for entity references, but DashboardPage doesn't appear to have modals that need this pattern.\n\nNow I'm checking the actual component implementations against the relevant rules: DashboardPage has proper padding and test IDs, CategoryFilter and DateRangeFilter need to avoid native select elements, and NavigationHeader should be checked for duplicate links. - No duplicate navigation links (doesn't have navigation, that's in NavigationHeader)\n\n### NavigationHeader.tsx\n- Has `data-testid=\"navbar\"` on the header ✓\n- Each link has `data-testid={`navbar-link-${link.key}`}` ✓\n- No duplicate links - all nav links point to unique paths ✓\n- No native `<select>` elements ✓\n\n### DateRangeFilter.tsx\n- Has `data-testid` on all interactive elements ✓\n- No native `<select>` elements ✓ (uses custom dropdown with button trigger)\n- Uses custom date inputs (`<input type=\"date\">`) which is fine since the directive only prohibits native `<select>` elements for filters\n\n### CategoryFilter.tsx\n- Has `data-testid` on all interactive elements ✓\n- No native `<select>` elements ✓ (uses custom dropdown with buttons)\n\n### LowInventoryAlerts.tsx\n- Has `data-testid` on container, rows, severity, material name, current qty, reorder point, view details, dismiss, reorder buttons ✓\n- Empty state has data-testid ✓\n\n### MaterialsCategoriesOverview.tsx\n- Has `data-testid` on container, heading, icon, category columns, category name, totals, material items, material links, \"View All Categories\" link ✓\n\nChecking the remaining components...\n\n### RecentTransactionsTable.tsx\n- Has `data-testid` on container, heading, table, empty state, rows, date, reference, accounts, materials, view details link, \"View All Transactions\" link ✓\n\n### NewTransactionButton.tsx\n- Has `data-testid=\"new-transaction-btn\"` ✓\n- Navigates to /transactions/new ✓\n\nLooking more closely at LowInventoryAlerts, I notice the Severity and Reorder Point columns are hidden on smaller screens with `max-lg:hidden`, but they still have proper test IDs when visible.\n\nAll dropdowns use custom components rather than native `<select>` elements, and the page root has consistent padding with responsive adjustments. The navigation links are unique with no duplicates.\n\nNow I'm cross-referencing the test spec requirements against the actual component implementations to ensure everything matches up. - Test: Category columns with name, total items, total units → Component shows these ✓\n- Test: Material names as clickable links → Component has links ✓\n- Test: \"View All Categories\" link → Component has this link ✓\n\nNow checking the RecentTransactionsTable component—it displays column headers for Date, Reference, Accounts Affected, Materials & Amounts, and Action, renders transaction rows with the appropriate data, and includes links for viewing full details and accessing all transactions, plus an empty state message when there's no data ✓\n\nFor DateRangeFilter, I'm verifying the label and calendar...\n\nContinuing with the remaining filters and buttons...\n\nAll the DashboardPage components check out against the writeApp.md directives—no violations found.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the directives more carefully. I want to make sure I'm not missing anything in how these components are structured. All the components follow the layout-agnostic pattern correctly—they don't include outer padding or margins on their root elements. I'm also noticing that the DashboardPage has some inline styles applied...\n\nNow I'm reviewing the directives more carefully to see what actually needs to be checked. The skill document emphasizes looking specifically at the Directives section, not just the Guidelines, so I need to distinguish between what's actually required versus what's recommended. Let me go through the directives systematically to see if there are any real violations. I've finished checking the remaining guidelines against the DashboardPage component—no violations found across modals, navigation, dropdowns, attachments, or padding requirements.

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component.**\n\n3. **For actions that produce side effects, write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once.**\n\n\n4. **Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements. Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.**\n\n5. **All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent.**\n\n6. **When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics.**\n\n7. **NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside a `.toPass()` retry block.**\n\n8. **Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks.**\n\n9. **For assertions that depend on backend round-trips, use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`).**\n\n10. **For tests that chain multiple user flows, add `test.slow()` at the top.**\n\n11. **For deployment tests, handle empty-state scenarios gracefully.**\n\n12. **When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field, the test must exercise that exact field.**\n\n13. **Auth flow testing requirements.**\n\nNow I'm reviewing the NavigationHeader tests to verify they follow these guidelines. The first test checks that the header displays branding and navigation links correctly using `getByTestId` for targeting, confirms visibility with appropriate timeouts, and validates both text content and link functionality.\n\nThe remaining navigation tests follow a consistent pattern: each one clicks a specific navigation link, verifies the URL matches the expected route, and confirms the destination page loads by checking for its identifying test ID. This ensures each navigation target is precisely verified.\n\nFor the LowInventoryAlerts tests, I'm checking that the alerts section renders with proper heading and icon, then verifying each alert displays all required information like severity, material name, quantity, and reorder point, with appropriate timeouts for slower operations. The Dismiss button test clicks the button and uses an atomic assertion with a 15-second timeout to confirm the alert count drops to zero, while verifying other alerts persist. There's a gap though—the test spec mentions persistence across page reloads, but the test doesn't actually reload to verify that behavior, which seems like it should be covered based on the directive about asserting side effects. The Reorder button test properly verifies the navigation chain—clicking the button, checking the URL structure, confirming the new transaction page loads, and validating the material parameter is passed through. The empty state test uses the slow marker appropriately and dismisses alerts atomically to reach the empty condition before asserting the count. Moving into the MaterialsCategoriesOverview tests, they all appear solid with proper coverage of the heading, icon, category columns showing names and counts, and each category displaying its expected content. transactions table updates when transaction status filter is applied\"** (line 505):\n- `test.slow()` ✓\n- Applies status filter and verifies table updates ✓\n- Verifies correct statuses displayed ✓\n\nThe RecentTransactionsTable tests are comprehensive and well-structured, covering navigation, data display, filtering, and edge cases with proper async handling.\n\nNow moving into the DateRangeFilter and CategoryFilter test suites — these are checking the filter components themselves work correctly in isolation and update the dashboard widgets when selections change.\n\nThe NewTransactionButton tests verify both the button's visual presentation and that clicking it properly navigates to the transaction creation page with the correct URL and content.\n\nScanning through all the tests now to check for compliance with the key directives — navigation tests are verifying both URL and page content, and I'm not seeing any problematic uses of `getByText()` with common words. calls in the test file. Everything uses `getByTestId`. ✓\n\n3. **Directive: \"NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside a `.toPass()` retry block\"** — I don't see any `.toPass()` blocks in the tests. ✓\n\n4. **Directive: \"Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach\"** — I don't see any `beforeEach` hooks. ✓\n\n5. **Directive: \"For assertions that depend on backend round-trips, use generous timeouts\"** — All visibility checks use `{ timeout: 30000 }` ✓\n\n6. **Directive: \"For tests that chain multiple user flows, add test.slow()\"** — Complex tests that filter data and verify have `test.slow()` ✓\n\n7. **Directive: \"For actions that produce side effects, write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect\"** — The dismiss test only checks that the alert disappears, but doesn't verify the dismissal persists after a page reload, which the spec explicitly requires. This looks like a gap.\n\n8. **Directive: \"All data-testid values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent\"** — The testids here match the component source code. ✓\n\n9. **Directive: \"When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field, the test must exercise that exact field\"** — All tests exercise the specific elements mentioned in the spec entries. ✓\n\nLooking at the dismiss test more closely, the spec says the dismissal should persist across page reloads, but the current test only verifies the immediate removal. the `.first()` usage here is actually appropriate since it's selecting the first element from a set of testid-based locators, not working around an ambiguous text selector. I'm checking the empty state test logic to see if there are any issues with how it waits for elements to become visible during the dismissal loop.\n\nThe main problem I'm spotting is that the \"Dismiss button removes the alert\" test doesn't verify the dismissal persists after a page reload, which the test spec explicitly requires.\n\nLooking back at the actual directives in writeTests.md, I need to check whether this falls under the requirement for side effects — the spec says the dismissal should persist, but the test doesn't validate that behavior on

Tests must verify navigation targets precisely (assert URL or page content)\n2. When a test spec entry implies a component across multiple pages, tests must interact on each page — never use `page.goto()` as workaround\n3. For actions that produce side effects, verify both primary effect and side effect; assert side effect happens exactly once\n4. Avoid `getByText()` with common words — prefer `getByTestId`\n5. All `data-testid` values across test files for the same component must be consistent\n6. When test spec describes file upload, exercise actual file upload mechanics\n7.
