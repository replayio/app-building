This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   175→   on what you found.\n   176→\n   177→### Bug Writeup Template\n   178→\n   179→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   180→\n   181→```\n   182→# Bug: <test name>\n   183→\n   184→## Step 1: Evidence\n   185→\n   186→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   187→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   188→no evidence.>\n   189→\n   190→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   191→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   192→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   193→\n   194→## Step 2: Determination\n   195→\n   196→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   197→\n   198→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   199→\n   200→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   201→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   202→```\n   203→\n   204→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   205→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   206→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   207→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   208→\n   209→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   210→\n   211→## Directives\n   212→\n   213→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   214→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   215→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   216→\n   217→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   218→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   219→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   220→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→\n   222→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   223→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   224→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   225→\n   226→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   227→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   228→\n   229→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   230→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   231→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   232→\n   233→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   234→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   235→\n   236→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   237→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   238→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   239→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   240→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   241→\n   242→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   243→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   244→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   245→\n   246→## Tips\n   247→\n   248→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   249→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   250→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   251→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   252→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   253→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   254→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   255→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   256→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   257→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   258→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   259→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   260→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   261→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   262→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   263→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   264→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   265→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   266→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   267→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   268→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   269→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   270→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   271→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   272→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   273→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   274→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   275→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   276→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   277→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   278→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   279→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   280→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   281→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   282→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   283→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":289,"startLine":1,"totalLines":289}}}

Let me write the PersonDetailPage tests. The tests need to cover all test entries from tests.md for:\n\n1. PersonHeader - name, title, email, phone, location, associated client links, navigation\n2. RelationshipsSection - heading, tabs, list view, graph view, filter, add entry, navigation\n3. ContactHistorySection - heading, entries, filter, add entry, edit, cancel\n4. AssociatedClientsSection - heading, client cards, status, industry, navigation, empty state\n\nKey consideration: The seed data only creates basic individuals without email/phone/location. I need to either:\n\n\n- Navigate to a person who has these fields (seed doesn't populate these)\n- Create test data via API\n\nThe seed data creates individuals with just name and title. No email, phone, or location. Also no pre-populated relationships or contact history. Looking at the test spec more carefully, the PersonHeader tests reference \"Dr. Anya Sharma\" with specific details, but the seed data doesn't have this person. The tests describe specific names, but the actual seed data has different people. For the tests to work, I should work with the actual seed data (Sarah Jenkins, Michael Chen, etc.) and test what the app actually shows. The test spec entries describe the behavior, not necessarily specific individuals.\n\nI need to adapt the tests to work with the seed data. I'll navigate to a person detail page for one of the seeded individuals, test the structural elements like headings and buttons, test CRUD operations like adding relationships or contact history, and test navigation. Since the individuals don't have email, phone, or location in the seed, those fields may not show up, but I should verify the structure is correct for what's available. Looking at the test spec more carefully, it specifies exact names and details that don't match the seed data, so I need to either create the test data via API or adjust my approach to work with what's actually seeded.\n\nThe simplest path is to navigate to the clients page, find a client, click through to their detail page, locate a person in the PeopleSection, and then navigate to that person's detail page to run the tests against real seeded data.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the API directly in the test to fetch an individual ID, which is more reliable. I'll make an API call to get the list of individuals, pick the first one, and navigate to their detail page. Now I'm setting up the test file with a helper function to fetch an individual ID from the API, then structuring the test suite...\n\nWriting test setup code...\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test specifications for each section—PersonHeader needs to verify the name display, contact information with icons, and client links that navigate correctly. RelationshipsSection should display its heading and content, and I need to continue through the remaining sections like ContactHistorySection and AssociatedClientsSection. Graph View and List View tabs\n3. List View displays relationship entries with all details\n4. Relationship entry Link navigates to the related person's detail page\n5. Each relationship Link navigates to the correct person\n6. Switching to Graph View tab\n7. Switching back to List View from Graph View\n8. Filter button is displayed in Relationships section\n9. Filter button opens filter options for relationships\n10. Add Entry button is displayed in Relationships section\n11. Add Entry button opens relationship creation form\n12. New relationship entry can be created successfully\n13. Add Entry form validates required fields\n14. Add Entry form can be cancelled\n15. Relationships section shows empty state when no relationships exist\n\n### ContactHistorySection Tests:\n1. Contact History section displays heading with icon\n2. Contact History shows chronological log entries\n3. Contact History displays various interaction types\n4. Contact History entries show team member with role\n5. Contact History entry edit icon opens edit form, saves changes, and can be cancelled\n6. Filter and Add Entry buttons work similarly to the Relationships section, with validation and empty state handling\n7. Associated Clients section displays client cards with status and industry information, navigating correctly to detail pages and showing empty state when needed\n\nI'm realizing the test spec is quite comprehensive. I need to write tests that verify the UI displays correctly based on the seed data available. Since the seed only populates name and title for individuals, I should focus on testing what's actually present rather than trying to test fields that won't have data. Let me start writing the actual test file with realistic expectations about what the seed data provides. but are not populated by seed data.\n\nOptions:\n1. Modify the seed to include email/phone/location - but that's changing the seed data which might affect other tests\n2. Use the API to update an individual before testing - but there's no PUT endpoint for individuals\n3. Test these only structurally (if the data happens to be populated, verify the elements exist)\n4. Create a new individual via direct API/database with all fields\n\nThe approach used in other tests is to work with the data that exists. For person header tests where email/phone/location might not be populated, I should navigate to a person who has these fields or skip if not available.\n\nBut the test spec explicitly requires testing email, phone, and location display. Since the job asks me to write the tests AND make them pass, I need to update the seed data to include these fields for at least some individuals. The seed data is used across test workers with their own database branches, so I'll need to be careful about how I modify it. The seed data comes from `scripts/seed-db.ts` and runs on each Neon branch, so if email/phone/location fields aren't populated there, the tests checking for them will fail. I could either update the seed to include these fields for test individuals, or have the tests create their own data—but since the FixViolation is specifically about writing tests for PersonDetailPage, I should focus on that and work with whatever data structure the seed provides.\n\nLet me update the seed to add richer data for a few individuals—email, phone, location, plus some relationships and contact history entries—so the tests have meaningful content to verify. I'm looking at how the existing tests like `table.spec.ts` discover data dynamically rather than hardcoding expectations, so I'll follow that pattern to make the tests more resilient.\n\nUpdating seed data... I'm deciding what seed data actually needs to be added for the tests to work properly. The key requirement is having Michael Chen associated with multiple clients so I can test the \"&\" separator in the UI. For contact history and relationships, I can either seed them or let the tests create their own data—I'll keep it minimal and only add what's necessary for the PersonDetailPage tests to run. Defining the contact records...\n\nI need to complete Tom Wilson's entry and then add the remaining contacts to the array. I'm also going to modify Sarah Jenkins' record to associate her with multiple clients so I can test how the display handles that scenario.\n\nNow I'm setting up the relationship entries between Sarah and her colleagues, plus adding contact history records like a video call and email to flesh out her interaction timeline. I should verify the database schema supports these additional columns since the original insert statement was minimal.\n\nWriting the test file... I'm realizing that `request` isn't available in `beforeAll` the way I thought—I need to check how Playwright actually provides the API context at the worker level versus the test level. I can use `page.request` to fetch the individuals list directly in `beforeEach`, which is cleaner than navigating through the UI. I'll make an API call to discover an individual and store their ID for the test.\n\nWriting the test setup... Writing test assertions...\n\nNow I'm thinking about the relationships and contact history tests—if the seed data doesn't include those, those tests will fail because they'll hit empty states instead of actual entries.
