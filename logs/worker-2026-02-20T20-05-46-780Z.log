The Authentication-related test entries, components, and tests\n\nLet me start by reading the relevant strategy documents and application docs.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2562,"cache_read_input_tokens":23712,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2562,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3a184117-0fba-45c5-9531-0c8581980ebd","uuid":"f53f68b2-f322-44c7-b81a-15e8f31cb274"}

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

Let me systematically check each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecAuthentication - Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication test entries\n\nI need to check the Authentication test entries in `docs/tests.md` (lines 7-69) against the directives in `testSpec.md`.\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler alternatives when the mockup specifies particular elements.\n4. Every clickable element needs its exact navigation target or action result documented—no vague destinations, and external flows must specify how they open and what happens when complete.\n5. For any data-mutating action, verify the change persists and that all expected side effects occur.\n6. Button and control styling matters: if the mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that appearance.\n7. Modal dialogs need comprehensive testing to ensure they function properly.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format.\n10. Configurable backend integrations need complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n11. State-changing actions require tests confirming that other parts of the app update appropriately.\n\nNow I'm checking the Authentication test entries against these directives and reviewing what's been covered so far—signup and login flows, user info display, sign-in buttons, and password recovery navigation.\n\nContinuing through the remaining test cases for the forgot password, reset password, and email confirmation pages, I'm verifying that each form element and interaction is accounted for in the test coverage. I'm noticing AUTH-RP-02 doesn't specify where the \"Go to app\" button navigates to, which seems like a gap. And looking at AUTH-CE-01, the test entry only checks for the error message but doesn't actually test the \"Go to app\" button that exists in the component code—that's another incomplete test case. I need to step back and think about this more carefully. The real question is whether the test spec entries themselves violate the directives, not whether the code matches the spec. Looking at AUTH-RP-02, it mentions a \"Go to app\" button but doesn't specify its data-testid or where it navigates to—that's a clear violation of the directive requiring exact navigation targets for clickable elements. For AUTH-CE-01, the spec doesn't mention the \"Go to app\" button at all, which creates ambiguity about whether the component should include it or if the spec is incomplete. I'm noticing the ConfirmEmailPage is missing a test for the success case—when a valid token actually confirms the email and signs the user in, even though the component description explicitly mentions this behavior. Similarly, ResetPasswordPage has tests for form visibility and error states, but there's no test entry for the actual password submission flow.\n\nLooking at the directives, this is a gap: directive 5 requires testing that data mutations are persisted, and directive 4 requires specifying exact action results for clickable elements like the submit button. I should also verify whether AUTH-FP-02 actually confirms the \"Back to app\" button's navigation target or just checks that the success message appears. Looking more closely at the ForgotPasswordPage spec, I see the \"Back to sign in\" button has a data-testid but AUTH-FP-01 doesn't verify where it navigates—another directive 4 violation. And while AUTH-USR-01 checks that the sign-out button is visible, AUTH-E2E-01 is what actually tests the sign-out action itself.\n\nNow checking directive 11 for state-changing actions: signup and signin both have tests confirming the app updates appropriately, and sign-out is covered by AUTH-E2E-01. But there's a gap—resetting the password has no test verifying that a user can actually sign in with the new password afterward, which violates directive 11.\n\nSo far I've found violations including a missing form submission test for AUTH-RP and the password reset verification gap.\n\nLooking at AUTH-CE, the component is supposed to confirm email and sign the user in, but only the error case is tested—the success path is completely missing, which violates directive 2's requirement to systematically test every element. AUTH-RP-02 also has an issue where the \"Go to app\" button lacks a specified navigation target or data-testid, violating directive 4. And AUTH-CE-01 is missing the \"Go to app\" button entirely.\n\nFor AUTH-FP-02, the \"Back to app\" button similarly lacks a navigation target specification. But I'm realizing I need to distinguish between spec violations and code violations—if the testSpec.md itself doesn't define the navigation target, that's a spec problem, not a code problem. Let me focus on what the directives actually require from the test spec itself.\n\nLooking at AUTH-FP-01 more carefully, the forgot password page includes a back link with a data-testid, but the spec doesn't specify where it should navigate—that's a directive 4 violation. For AUTH-RP-02, the \"Go to app\" button has no data-testid at all and no navigation target, which violates both directive 4 and the requirement that clickable elements should have test identifiers.\n\nAUTH-CE-01 is missing the \"Go to app\" button entirely from its expected output, even though the component has it. I need to check whether the test spec is actually complete and thorough, separate from whether the code itself matches the spec.\n\nThe real issue I'm seeing now is that AUTH-RP-01 only verifies the form is visible—there's no test entry for actually submitting the reset password form with matching passwords and confirming the password changes work, like by signing in afterward.\n\nSimilarly, there's no success path test for email confirmation; AUTH-CE-01 only covers the error case. And AUTH-RP-02 and AUTH-FP-01 both have navigation elements without clear data-testid attributes or specified targets, which violates the directive about making test targets explicit.\n\nFor AUTH-FP-01 specifically, the \"back-to-signin\" naming is suggestive but the directive requires explicit navigation targets to be documented in the spec.\n\nNow I'm checking what elements are actually present in the SidebarUserArea component—when logged in it has the avatar, name, and sign-out button, but I need to verify what shows when the user isn't logged in.\n\nLooking at the auth form states, I notice the Cancel button that closes the form isn't covered in the AUTH-USR-02 test, and the \"Forgot password?\" link only appears in sign-in mode, not sign-up mode, which also isn't explicitly tested. There's also a confirmation message state after sign-up that has a \"Back to sign in\" button I should account for.\n\nChecking against the requirements, the Cancel button is an interactive element that needs testing—that's a clear violation. Let me identify all the gaps in the authentication test coverage.\n\nThe reset password form submission lacks a test for actually verifying persistence after submission, the email confirmation flow is missing a test for the success path, the \"Go to app\" button needs a data-testid and explicit navigation target, the error state is missing a way to navigate away entirely, and the \"back to sign in\" link doesn't specify its navigation destination.\n\nNow I'm questioning whether the Cancel button is actually a spec violation or just a code addition—the spec describes the auth form's elements, and if the Cancel button is visible and interactive, it should be documented there. But the spec description seems to cut off mid-sentence, so I need to see what it actually says about the form's interactive elements.\n\nLooking at what the spec does cover, the main gaps I'm seeing are around testing the reset password submission flow, the email confirmation process, and some missing navigation targets for buttons. Those feel like the clearer violations to focus on.\n\nNow I'm moving into checking the Authentication components themselves against the writeApp.md directives—specifically whether the test entries in the spec are actually satisfied by the app code, how the visual elements match the mockup, and whether all components have the required testid attributes. data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything that E2E tests will need to target.\n4. In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory, add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` to `netlify.toml`.\n5. When using the neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax.\n6. For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null before inserting or updating. Use `value || null`.\n7. Netlify Functions path index: function name at index 2, resource ID at index 3.\n8. When building modals that reference other entities, use a searchable select/dropdown, not a plain text input for IDs.\n9. Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL.\n10. Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a custom design system.\n11. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails.\n12. Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.\n\nNow I'm checking the password reset components against these guidelines. ForgotPasswordPage looks good with proper test IDs and no database interactions or problematic elements. ResetPasswordPage also has the right structure, but I'm noticing it's reusing the same `data-testid=\"reset-password-error\"` for both the missing token error and the form validation error, which could cause issues with test targeting. Looking at the duplicate `data-testid` issue more carefully—both the no-token error div and the form error message share the same test ID, which is problematic even if they're in separate branches. More critically, the \"Go to app\" button in the no-token state is missing a `data-testid` entirely, violating the requirement that all interactive elements must have test identifiers. I'm seeing the same pattern in ConfirmEmailPage.tsx where the \"Go to app\" button in the error state also lacks the required test ID, and I'm now checking Sidebar.tsx for similar violations.\n\nThe Cancel button in the auth form is another issue—it's an interactive element with no `data-testid`, which directly violates directive 3 even though the spec might not explicitly mention it. However, I notice the \"Back to sign in\" button does have the proper test ID, so there's inconsistency in how these buttons are being handled.\n\nNow I'm checking the auth.ts Netlify function for SQL injection vulnerabilities and proper type handling. The UUID and timestamp values are generated server-side from `crypto.randomUUID()` and `Date.now()`, so they're safe. The user inputs like email, password, and token are strings, not date fields, so there's no issue with empty string conversions there.\n\nThe function uses query parameters rather than path segments, so the path indexing directive doesn't apply. I'm also verifying that all database queries use tagged template literals and that the neon driver is properly configured throughout the codebase.\n\nNow I'm checking the authentication components for missing test IDs on interactive elements—the \"Go to app\" buttons in ResetPasswordPage and ConfirmEmailPage, plus the \"Cancel\" button in Sidebar all need `data-testid` attributes. I should also verify that the component behavior matches the test specifications, like confirming the user area displays correctly when logged in and the sign-in form appears when not authenticated. \"Go to app\" button exists but lacks a data-testid, making it untestable by the current test spec. Now I'm moving on to check the authentication tests against the writeTests.md directives, which require verifying navigation targets precisely, checking both primary and side effects, avoiding common text selectors, maintaining consistent data-testid values across all tests, and following additional test specifications.\n\nLooking at auth.spec.ts, the forgot-password test correctly asserts the URL after navigation, while the e2e login/logout test verifies the visible state but doesn't explicitly check the URL after those actions.  The clients navigation test uses `page.goto()` which implicitly confirms navigation succeeded, and it validates that page elements are visible. For side effects, the auth flow doesn't have explicit side effects like history entries to worry about. Now checking how the tests use `getByText` and other locator methods...\n\nThe auth tests consistently use `getByTestId` throughout and avoid `getByText` entirely, with all test IDs matching between test and component code. File uploads and `.toPass()` with nested waits don't apply here, and the tests cover all elements mentioned in the specs.\n\nNow I'm noticing that AUTH-RP-02 checks for the visibility of the reset password error element, but it doesn't actually verify the error message text itself—it only confirms the element is visible, which doesn't fully satisfy the spec requirement to verify the \"No reset token provided\" message.\n\nThe same issue appears in AUTH-CE-01, where the test checks visibility of the confirmation error element without verifying its actual text content. And AUTH-FP-02 has a similar pattern where it checks for the success message element's visibility but the assertion appears to be cut off.\n\nLooking at AUTH-RP-02, the spec mentions a \"Go to app\" button that the test doesn't verify—though this is partly a component issue since the button lacks a data-testid attribute for testing. AUTH-USR-03 is checking sidebar visibility and the sign-in button, but it's missing verification that actual client data is displayed on the page, which the spec explicitly requires. The test only checks sidebar visibility but doesn't verify that actual client data is displayed, which the spec explicitly requires. I need to identify which test violations to report — the reset and confirmation token tests are clear violations since they don't check the specific error message text, but I should focus on the most meaningful gaps rather than nitpicking every detail. Looking at AUTH-RP-02 more closely, the test only verifies that the error container is visible but misses checking for the specific error message text and the \"Go to app\" button that are both part of the specification. The button's lack of a data-testid attribute makes it harder to test directly, but that's a separate implementation issue. I'm narrowing down which violations are genuinely significant enough to report.\n\nI'm identifying three main root causes: missing test entries in the specification document, missing data-testid attributes on several buttons across the auth pages, and incomplete test assertions that don't verify all the requirements listed in the spec. I should group these violations by their underlying cause rather than reporting each test failure individually. them more tightly:\n\n**Group 1: Missing test spec entries for password reset submission and email confirmation success**\nThis is a testSpec violation. Need to add test entries and then implement tests and potentially components.\n\n**Group 2: Missing data-testid attributes and navigation targets in spec/components**\nSeveral buttons across multiple components lack data-testid. The spec entries also lack navigation targets for these buttons.\n\n**Group 3: Tests not fully verifying spec entry requirements (text content, button presence)**\nTests are checking element visibility but not verifying specific text content or button presence mentioned in spec entries.\n\nNow I'm thinking about how to structure these into fix groups. The strategy says to group related tasks by root cause, and I'm realizing these three issues are actually interconnected—adding the missing test entries will require adding data-testids and writing the corresponding tests. I need to decide whether to combine them into one fix group or keep them separate, since each group will get its own worker. iteration, I should make them self-contained.\n\nLet me think again...\n\nGroup A: Fix the spec entries (add missing entries, add navigation targets, add data-testids to existing entries)\nGroup B: Fix the components (add missing data-testids)\nGroup C: Fix the tests (add missing assertions, write new tests for new entries)\n\nBut the spec, components, and tests need to be consistent. If I add a test entry, I need the component to support it and a test to verify it. So maybe it's better to group by feature:\n\nGroup 1: Missing data-testid attributes on auth buttons (affects spec + components + tests)\nGroup 2: Missing test spec entries + tests for reset password submission and email confirmation success\n\nActually, I think the simplest approach is:\n\n1. Fix missing data-testids and navigation targets (spec + component fixes)\n2. Add missing test entries + tests for untested flows\n3. Fix existing tests to verify all spec requirements\n\nSo my plan: update the test entries for reset password and email confirmation to include data-testids and navigation targets on their action buttons, add new entries for the form submission and success flows, then update the component implementations to include those data-testids, and finally write tests that verify all the navigation and submission behaviors. I'm realizing the fix groups should align with the strategy pattern—each group needs FixViolation, RunTests, and DocumentFix jobs. But I'm debating whether three separate groups (one for data-testids, one for missing spec entries, one for incomplete test assertions) is too granular, or if I should consolidate based on dependencies. The data-testid fixes enable the test updates, so maybe I should group those together, but they have different root causes. Let me think about what makes sense from a workflow perspective rather than just root cause isolation. I'm completing the second fix group with the missing test entries and strengthened assertions, then stepping back to list out all violations found before organizing them into coherent fix
