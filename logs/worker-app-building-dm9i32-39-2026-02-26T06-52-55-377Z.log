No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs).

A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Now let me proceed with the three subtasks systematically.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecMaterialsPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations\n\nLet me review each testSpec.md directive against the MaterialsPage test entries:\n\n**Directives from testSpec.md:**\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler elements when the mockup calls for something more complex — if there are computed columns or multiple filters shown, I need to test all of them, not just the easiest ones.\n4. Every clickable element needs a specific navigation target or action result spelled out; no ambiguous destinations. External flows like OAuth or payments need to specify how they open and what happens when complete.\n5. Any action that changes data requires test entries that verify the mutation happens correctly.\n6. Button appearance — text, icons, styling — matters and should be verified, not just the existence of a button.\n7. Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they work as intended.\n8. File uploads should be supported unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must document the expected format upfront, and tests should confirm users see that documentation before attempting the import.\n10. Configurable backend integrations like webhooks or OAuth apps need complete setup instructions visible in the UI.\n11. State-changing actions require test coverage.\n\nState mutations must trigger appropriate updates elsewhere in the app — if there's a timeline or history feature, every tracked change needs a history entry created atomically to prevent duplicates from re-renders. I need to think through each field that can change and whether it requires history tracking, and for reciprocal relationships, modifying one side must automatically update the other.\n\nNow I'm going through the MaterialsPage test entries to verify they align with these principles. The NewMaterialButton tests check that the button displays with the right icon, that clicking it opens the create modal, and that submitting the form persists the new material to the table.\n\nThe validation tests confirm that Material Name, Category, and Unit of Measure are all required fields, and the cancel button properly closes the modal without creating anything. For NewCategoryButton, I'm verifying similar patterns — the button appears as a secondary action, clicking it opens the create category modal, and submitting the form adds the new category to the system.\n\nNow I'm checking the category modal validation and ensuring that newly created categories immediately appear in the dropdown when adding materials. Moving into MaterialsTable, I'm testing the breadcrumb navigation, sidebar active state, column headers, and data display across the materials list.\n\nThe actions column needs to support multiple interaction patterns—View Detail and Edit links alongside icon buttons that trigger the same navigation and modal behaviors. I'm verifying that both the link and icon versions navigate correctly to the detail page, that the edit modal opens with pre-filled data, and that submissions persist changes while cancellations discard them.\n\nThe search bar should filter materials by name case-insensitively and display an empty state when there are no matches. The category filter dropdown is next to verify. The sort dropdown needs to display the default \"Name (A-Z)\" option and allow users to switch between different sorting methods like reverse alphabetical order or by stock levels in either direction. Then I'm moving into the pagination tests, which verify that page navigation works correctly through both the next button and direct page number selection.\n\nNow I'm checking the pagination edge cases—making sure the previous button is disabled on the first page and the next button is disabled on the last page. I also need to verify that pagination properly updates when filters reduce the result set, and that filters and search can work together to narrow down the displayed items.\n\nI'm also reviewing the directive about clickable elements and their navigation targets. Looking at the breadcrumb test, I see it specifies that \"Home\" navigates to the Dashboard, but I should check whether \"Materials\" in the breadcrumb is also clickable and where it should navigate.\n\nFor the modal dialog testing, I'm noticing a potential gap: the edit modal in MaterialsTable only validates the Material Name field, while the create modal tests validation for Name, Category, and Unit of Measure. However, I can see that the MaterialDetailPage's edit modal does cover those additional validations, so the coverage is actually there across both edit implementations. I'll note this as something to review but not necessarily a violation. Now checking persistence across the directives—the create and edit material tests both verify database persistence, as does the category creation test. For the state-changing actions directive, I can see that newly created categories properly update the CategoryFilter, but I'd need to check whether creating materials triggers updates elsewhere in the app like a dashboard or inventory view.\n\nLooking at the AppSpec for mockup verification would be helpful, though the test directives focus on matching visible elements rather than visual design. The MaterialsPage components seem well-covered: NewMaterialButton, NewCategoryButton, SearchBar, CategoryFilter, AccountFilter, SortDropdown, MaterialsTable, and Pagination. There don't appear to be any import or upload dialogs on this page, so that directive doesn't apply here.\n\nI'm noticing a gap in the SortDropdown tests—there's a \"Category (A-Z)\" option listed in the dropdown, but I don't see a test case for selecting it. The existing tests cover Name (Z-A), Stock (Low to High), and Stock (High to Low), but that Category sort option seems to be missing coverage. Looking at the mockup details, the actions column only lists View Detail, Edit, and icon buttons—no delete action is mentioned, so that's likely not an issue. The Breadcrumb test placement under MaterialsTable is fine since the spec doesn't require separate component sections. So the main gap I'm seeing is that \"Category (A-Z)\" is listed as a sort option but lacks a dedicated test entry, which seems to violate the directive to test all four sort options. I've identified that \"Category (A-Z)\" is the only sort option missing test coverage, which violates directive 2. Let me also verify the edit modal tests are checking the right fields and see if there are any other gaps I'm missing by reviewing the AppSpec more carefully. I'm noticing the edit modal from MaterialsTable doesn't explicitly test for a Description field, while both the create modal and the edit modal from MaterialDetailPage do include it—this could be an inconsistency, but it might also be intentional if the table's edit modal is a simplified version.

Let me search for them.\n\nI notice from the code:\n1. MaterialsPage.tsx - Uses `FilterSelect` from `@shared/components/FilterSelect` for category and account filters. \n2. CategoryFilter.tsx - A standalone component that appears to NOT be used on the MaterialsPage directly (the page uses `FilterSelect` instead).\n3. MaterialsTable.tsx - Has the edit modal inline.\n\n\n4. MaterialsPage.tsx uses `<FilterSelect>` for both the category filter (testId=\"category-filter\") and account filter (testId=\"account-filter\"), while CategoryFilter.tsx exists but isn't actually being used on the page.\n\nNow I need to check the writeApp.md directives against what I'm seeing in the code. the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n3. Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything that E2E tests will need to target.\n5. In a monorepo, add `base = \"apps/...\"` to `netlify.toml` - would need to check netlify.toml\n6. When using neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax\n7. For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n8. Netlify Functions path index issue\n9. When building modals that reference other entities, use a searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs - The category dropdown in the create material modal uses `FilterSelect`.\n10. Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links\n11. Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns\n12. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons\n13. Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads\n14. Every page component must include consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n15. All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n\nNow I'm checking MaterialsPage.tsx against directive 15 and finding that the filter bar, pagination section, and create material modal are all rendered inline instead of being extracted into separate components. Looking at the actual implementation versus the test spec, I see that only MaterialsTable is properly abstracted into its own component, while the Create Material Modal, Create Category Modal, Sort Dropdown, Pagination, and Search input are all inlined directly in MaterialsPage.tsx—which violates the writeApp.md directive that all JSX must be abstracted into separate components with their own files.\n\nNow checking the remaining directives: MaterialsPage doesn't use native HTML `<select>` elements, instead relying on FilterSelect from shared components for the filters and a custom dropdown for sorting. The page has the correct padding applied with `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. For interactive elements, I'm verifying that all have proper data-testid attributes like `new-material-btn`, `new-category-btn`, and `materials-search`. Checking the MaterialsTable edit modal validation logic—it only validates the Material Name field, but doesn't validate Category or Unit of Measure even though those are required. The test spec only covers Material Name validation in this context, while the EditMaterialButton tests on MaterialDetailPage validate all three fields, so there's a gap between what the code actually validates and what it should validate. The test spec should include validation tests for all required fields in the edit modal, not just Material Name. Looking at the MaterialsTable edit modal tests, I see they cover Name, Category, and Unit pre-fill along with Save and Cancel buttons, but there's no Description pre-fill test even though the create modal and the edit modal from MaterialDetailPage both include Description. This is a gap in the test spec coverage. The Description field should be included in the test spec since it's present in the modal and consistent with other edit modals in the codebase. I'm also noticing that the MaterialsTable edit modal only validates the Material Name field, while the create modal validates all three fields—this could be a code inconsistency worth addressing, though the current test spec only requires Name validation.\n\nLet me check if CategoryFilter.tsx is actually being used anywhere or if it's a dead component, and then I'll compile the full list of test spec violations I've identified so far, starting with the missing \"Category (A-Z)\" sort test and the Description field pre-fill check in the edit modal.\n\nLooking at the writeApp.md violations, the main issue is that several UI components—the Create Material Modal, Create Category Modal, Search Bar, Sort Dropdown, and Pagination—are all defined inline within MaterialsPage.tsx instead of being extracted into their own separate component files. The edit modal also appears to be inline rather than abstracted.\n\nI should also verify whether CategoryFilter.tsx is actually being used anywhere, since it exists as a file but I don't see it imported in MaterialsPage.tsx. Let me check if there are any other unused component files or missing imports that would indicate incomplete

[2026-02-26T06:51:50.016Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_019eLspmTBp8t4Mft4NNEnJD","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"There are no MaterialsPage-specific test files. The only tests are `dashboard.spec.ts` and `deployment.spec.ts`, which reference materials but in the context of the dashboard page, not the MaterialsPage itself.\n\nNow let me complete my analysis for all three subtasks.\n\n## Summary of findings:\n\n### Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecMaterialsPage - testSpec.md directive violations\n\n1. **Missing \"Category (A-Z)\" sort test** - The sort dropdown lists 5 options but only 4 are tested (Name A-Z is default). \"Category (A-Z)\" has no test for selecting and verifying it. \n\nThis violates directives 2 and 3, which require systematically inventorying every visible element and testing all options, not just the easiest ones.\n\n2. **Edit modal from MaterialsTable missing Description field check** - The \"Clicking Edit link opens an edit material modal with pre-filled data\" test doesn't verify that Description is pre-filled, even though both the create modal and the MaterialDetailPage edit modal include it. This violates directive 7 about completely testing modal dialogs.\n\n3. **Edit modal from MaterialsTable missing Category and Unit of Measure validation tests** - The create modal has validation tests for these fields, but the edit modal test doesn't verify the same validations work when editing existing materials.\n\nActually, I'm reconsidering this one. The Category field uses a dropdown that always has a value and doesn't include an empty option, so it can't be cleared and doesn't need validation. The Unit of Measure is a text input that could theoretically be cleared, but the code doesn't validate it either—which seems more like a code bug than a test gap.\n\nFor the test spec itself, the real issue is consistency: both the MaterialsTable and MaterialDetailPage have edit modals for the same entity, so they should have the same validation coverage. Since directive 7 requires completely testing modal dialogs wherever they appear, the MaterialsTable's edit modal should test Unit of Measure validation just like the MaterialDetailPage does.\n\nNow looking at the actual violations in MaterialsPage.tsx, I'm seeing several UI components built inline as JSX that should be abstracted out—the Create Material Modal, Create Category Modal, Search Bar, Sort Dropdown, and Pagination controls are all embedded directly in the page rather than extracted into separate components.\n\nFor the edit modal in MaterialsTable.tsx, it only validates Material Name while the create modal validates Name, Category, and Unit of Measure. But checking against the test requirements, the edit modal test only specifies Material Name validation, so the code actually does satisfy what's being tested—this is more of a consistency issue than a spec violation.\n\nThe main writeApp.md violation I'm finding is the inline JSX that should be extracted into separate component files. CategoryFilter.tsx isn't a dead file since it's used on the dashboard, so that's not an issue. The app also doesn't use native `<select>` elements, which is good.\n\nNow I need to check for Playwright test files specific to MaterialsPage and see if there are any writeTests.md violations.\n\nThere aren't any MaterialsPage-specific test files yet, so there's nothing to validate against the writeTests.md directive. The absence of tests is notable, but since no tests exist, there can't be directive violations within them.\n\nLet me compile the violations I've found so far. The main issues are in testSpec.md: missing test coverage for the \"Category (A-Z)\" sort option, the edit modal test doesn't verify that the Description field is pre-filled, and the edit modal tests lack validation checks.\n\nI also found that writeApp.md violations exist in MaterialsPage.tsx where the Create Material Modal, Create Category Modal, Sort Dropdown, and Pagination components are defined inline instead of being abstracted. I'll group the testSpec.md issues together as one fix task since they're all documentation updates, and handle the code refactoring as a separate task.","signature":"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
