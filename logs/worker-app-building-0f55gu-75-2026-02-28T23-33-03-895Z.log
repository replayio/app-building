Let me systematically go through each directive.\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n1. Consistent styling/navigation over exact mockup adherence\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element — write test entry for each\n3. Do not substitute easier elements for what mockup shows\n4. Every clickable element must specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. Data mutations must verify persistence and exact side effects (no duplicates)\n6. Button/control appearance (text, icons, styling) must be tested\n7. Completely test modal dialogs\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must test that other parts of the app update (history, reciprocal relationships)\n\nNow let me go through each OrderDetailsPage section and test entry systematically.\n\n### OrderSummary section (lines 456-499)\n\n- **Display Order ID in Header** — Tests heading display. OK.\n- **Display Supplier Name as Link** — Specifies navigation target `/suppliers/<supplierId>`. OK per directive 4.\n- **Display Order Date** — Tests date display. OK.\n- **Display Expected Delivery Date** — Tests date display. OK.\n- **Display Status Badge** — Tests badge appearance with color-coded statuses. OK per directive 6.\n- **Display Overall Cost** — Tests currency formatting. OK.\n- **Edit Button Opens Edit Dialog** — Tests modal dialog, specifies fields (expected delivery, status), persistence, and history entry side effect. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n- **Print Button Triggers Print** — Tests browser print dialog. OK per directive 4.\n\n### LineItemsTable section (lines 501-546)\n\n- **Display Line Items Table with Correct Columns** — Tests column headers. OK.\n- **Display Line Item Row Data** — Tests row data with currency formatting. OK.\n- **Display Multiple Line Items** — Tests all line items. OK.\n- **Add Line Item** — Tests modal, persistence, CostBreakdown update, and history entry. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n- **Edit Line Item** — Tests modal pre-fill, persistence, CostBreakdown update, and history entry. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n- **Delete Line Item** — Tests confirmation dialog, CostBreakdown update, and history entry. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n\n### CostBreakdown section (lines 548-575)\n\n- **Display Subtotal** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Display Tax with Percentage** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Display Discount with Label** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Display Total Cost with Currency** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Cost Breakdown Updates When Line Items Change** — Tests recalculation. OK per directive 11.\n\n### OrderDocuments section (lines 577-614)\n\n- **Display Document List** — Tests document entries. OK.\n- **Display Document Details** — Tests specific document. OK.\n- **Display Multiple Documents** — Tests all documents. OK.\n- **View Button Opens Document** — Tests \"View\" button action (new tab). OK per directive 4.\n- **Download Button Downloads Document** — Tests download action. OK per directive 4.\n- **Upload Document** — Tests file upload dialog, document type entry, persistence, and history entry. OK per directives 7, 8, 11.\n\n### OrderHistory section (lines 616-650)\n\n- **Display Timeline of Events** — Tests vertical timeline. OK.\n- **Display Event Timestamp and Description** — Tests specific entry. OK.\n- **Display All History Entries** — Tests all entries in reverse chronological order. OK.\n- **Timeline Entry Icons** — Tests icon appearance per event type. OK per directive 6.\n- **History Entry Created on Status Change** — Tests \"exactly one\" entry. OK per directive 5.\n- **History Entry Created on Line Item Modification** — Tests \"exactly one\" entry. OK per directive 5.\n\nLet me check a few things more carefully. Let me review if there are any missing test entries by looking at the app spec and components.\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/docs/AppSpec.md\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/docs/AppRevisions.md\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/pages/OrderDetailsPage*\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/order*/**\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/**/*rder*\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/**/*Order*\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/*ine*\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/*Cost*\nGood. The OrderDetailsPage has these components: OrderSummary, LineItemsTable, CostBreakdown, OrderDocuments, OrderHistory. The test spec covers all of them. Let me also check if there's an AppSpec to verify completeness.\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/docs/*\n[read] /repo/apps/SupplierTracker/docs/mockup-order-details.png\nNow let me carefully compare the mockup to the test entries and check all testSpec.md directives against the OrderDetailsPage entries (lines 450-650 of docs/tests.md).\n\n### Findings for CheckTestSpecOrderDetailsPage\n\nI'll check each directive systematically:\n\n**Directive 1 (Consistent styling/navigation):** The breadcrumb description at line 452 is consistent with other pages. OK.\n\n**Directive 2 (Inventory every visible element):** The breadcrumb links (\"Dashboard\", \"Orders\") are visible clickable elements in the mockup but have NO dedicated test entries — they're only described in the section header text at line 452. This is a violation.\n\n**Directive 3 (Don't substitute easier elements):** All columns, fields, and sections from the mockup appear to be tested as shown. OK.\n\n**Directive 4 (Every clickable element specifies navigation target):** The breadcrumb links specify targets in the section description but lack actual test entries. Violation (same as directive 2).\n\n**Directive 5 (Mutations verify persistence and side effects):** Edit, Add/Edit/Delete line items, and Upload Document all mention history entry side effects. The \"exactly one\" constraint is enforced in the dedicated OrderHistory test entries (lines 642, 647). OK.\n\n**Directive 6 (Button/control appearance):** Edit button (pencil icon + \"Edit\"), Print button (printer icon + \"Print\"), status badge colors, timeline icons — all tested. OK.\n\n**Directive 7 (Completely test modal dialogs):** This is a **violation**. The DashboardPage has separate cancel and validation test entries for every dialog (lines 40-49, 62-71), but OrderDetailsPage dialogs are missing these:\n- **Edit Order dialog**: No cancel test, no validation test\n- **Add Line Item dialog**: No cancel test, no validation test\n- **Edit Line Item dialog**: No cancel test\n- **Delete Line Item confirmation**: No cancel test\n- **Upload Document dialog**: No cancel test\n\n**Directive 8 (File uploads):** Upload Document entry specifies file upload. OK.\n\n**Directive 9 (Import format docs):** Not applicable — no data import dialogs on this page.\n\n**Directive 10 (Backend integrations):** Not applicable to this page.\n\n**Directive 11 (State-changing updates across app):** Edit, Add/Edit/Delete line items all specify CostBreakdown and OrderHistory updates. OK.\n\n### Violations Summary (TestSpec)\n\n1. **Missing breadcrumb navigation test entries** — Clickable breadcrumb links lack dedicated test entries (directives 2, 4)\n2. **Missing modal cancel/validation test entries** — OrderDetailsPage dialogs lack cancel and validation tests that DashboardPage dialogs have (directive 7)\n\nLet me add fix tasks for these.\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\" --app \"SupplierTracker\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixViolation: Add missing breadcrumb navigation test entries for OrderDetailsPage in docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixViolation: Add missing modal cancel/validation test entrie...

Let me summarize what happened in each and write the analysis files. Let me process them one by one.\n\n**Log 75**: API error on first turn. Task was reviewing bug reports. No shell commands run. Retry 2/3.\n\n**Log 76**: Reviewing bug reports. Read files, ran glob patterns. Hit API error after 7 turns. Task failed 3 times and was skipped. No shell commands.\n\n**Log 77**: Check directive compliance for SupplierTracker. Ran several shell commands:\n1. `ls /repo/apps/` - list apps\n\n\n2. `cat /repo/tasks/tasks-app-building-eghui7.json | head -30` - read task file\n3. `cat /repo/tasks/tasks-app-building-knfcm0.json | head -30` - read task file\n4. `npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts ...` (4 times) - add tasks to queue\nHit API error after 12 turns.\n\n**Log 78**: CheckBackend for SupplierTracker - check writeApp.md directives. Read many files. Hit API error after 8 turns. No shell commands.\n\n**Log 79**: CheckBackend for SupplierTracker continued. Ran shell commands to check file structure and read configuration files. Hit API error after 10 turns.\n\n**Log 80**: Deploying the Accounting app. Started by listing available apps and checking environment configuration, then installed dependencies and ran the deployment command. Set up the replay browser and attempted to run deployment tests with Playwright, then checked the deployment status via HTTP request.\n\n**Log 80**: Now examining the CheckDirectives task for SupplierTracker's OrderDetailsPage. Looking through the task files and app structure to understand what needs to be checked.\n\n**Log 81**: Working through FixViolation tasks for OrderDetailsPage, reading the relevant files before hitting an API error after just a few turns.\n\n**Log 82**: Attempting the same FixViolation tasks again, but the API errors persist and the task gets skipped after three failed attempts.\n\n**Log 83**: Retrying the CheckDirectives for OrderDetailsPage, though an API error occurs immediately on the first turn.\n\nNow I'm going to write out the analysis files more carefully this time, making sure I'm thorough and comprehensive in documenting what happened across these logs.\n\nLooking at the shell command usage: Log 77 had 7 commands across 3 distinct types. Log 78 and 79 only involved file reads without any shell commands. Log 8 was heavy on commands with 9 total across 7 different types including deployment and testing tools.
