Let me check the git history to see if there's any context about how bug reports were being tracked.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1313,"cache_read_input_tokens":29505,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1313,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"03ecfdbb-d3fc-49bc-ac86-ff020039657d","uuid":"19d3faac-edad-495e-ac5d-ba89958792f8"}
