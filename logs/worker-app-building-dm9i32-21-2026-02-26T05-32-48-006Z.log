Each tag chip has a colored background to visually distinguish it.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable Tags column empty for untagged transactions**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with transactions that have no tags.\n- **Action:** User observes the Tags column for a transaction without tags.\n- **Expected:** The Tags column is empty or displays a dash/placeholder for transactions that have no tags/categories assigned.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable empty state when no transactions exist**\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to the TransactionsPage and no transactions have been recorded yet.\n- **Action:** User observes the table area.\n- **Expected:** An empty state message is displayed (e.g., \"No transactions found\") indicating that no transactions have been recorded. The NewTransactionButton is still accessible to create the first transaction.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable empty state when filters produce no results**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with filters applied that match no transactions (e.g., AccountFilter set to a newly created account with no transactions).\n- **Action:** User observes the table area.\n- **Expected:** An empty state message is displayed (e.g., \"No transactions found matching your filters\") indicating no transactions match the current filter criteria. The filter controls remain accessible so the user can adjust or clear them.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable updates after saving a new transaction**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with existing transactions listed.\n- **Action:** User clicks the NewTransactionButton, fills in the NewTransactionModal with a new transaction (date: \"Nov 1, 2023\", description: \"Office Supplies\", account: Checking Account, type: Debit, amount: $75.00), and clicks \"Save Transaction\".\n- **Expected:** After the modal closes, the TransactionsTable updates to include the new \"Office Supplies\" transaction. The new row appears in the correct position based on the current sort order (e.g., at the top if sorted by date descending). The Pagination total updates to reflect the additional transaction.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable updates after editing a transaction**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage. User clicks on the \"Grocery Store\" row to open it in the NewTransactionModal, changes the description to \"Grocery Store - Weekly\", and clicks \"Save Transaction\".\n- **Action:** User observes the TransactionsTable after the modal closes.\n- **Expected:** The \"Grocery Store\" row now displays the updated description \"Grocery Store - Weekly\". No duplicate row is created. All other columns remain unchanged.\n\n#### Component: Pagination\n\n**Test: Pagination displays below the TransactionsTable**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with more transactions than fit on a single page (e.g., more than 10 or 20 transactions depending on page size).\n- **Action:** User observes the area below the TransactionsTable.\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are displayed below the table, showing the current page number, total pages, and navigation buttons. The controls include: a previous page button (left arrow), page number indicators, and a next page button (right arrow). A label such as \"Page 1 of 5\" or \"Showing 1–20 of 95 transactions\" is displayed.\n\n**Test: Pagination navigates to the next page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1 of transactions with pagination controls visible.\n- **Action:** User clicks the next page button (right arrow).\n- **Expected:** The TransactionsTable updates to display the next set of transaction rows (page 2). The pagination label updates to reflect the current page (e.g., \"Page 2 of 5\"). The previous page button becomes enabled. The page scrolls to the top of the table.\n\n**Test: Pagination navigates to the previous page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on page 2 of the TransactionsPage table.\n- **Action:** User clicks the previous page button (left arrow).\n- **Expected:** The TransactionsTable updates to display the first set of transaction rows (page 1). The pagination label updates to reflect page 1. The previous page button becomes disabled since the user is on the first page.\n\n**Test: Pagination previous button disabled on first page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1.\n- **Action:** User observes the previous page button.\n- **Expected:** The previous page button (left arrow) is disabled/grayed out, indicating there is no previous page to navigate to.\n\n**Test: Pagination next button disabled on last page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing the last page of transactions (e.g., page 5 of 5).\n- **Action:** User observes the next page button.\n- **Expected:** The next page button (right arrow) is disabled/grayed out, indicating there is no next page to navigate to.\n\n**Test: Pagination clicking a specific page number navigates to that page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1 with page number indicators visible (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n- **Action:** User clicks the page number \"3\".\n- **Expected:** The TransactionsTable updates to display the transactions for page 3. The page number \"3\" is highlighted/active. The pagination label updates to reflect page 3.\n\n**Test: Pagination updates when filters change result count**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 3 of 5 pages of transactions.\n- **Action:** User applies a filter (e.g., selects \"Checking Account (Chase Bank)\" in the AccountFilter) that reduces the total results to a single page.\n- **Expected:** The Pagination resets to page 1. The page number indicators update to show fewer pages (e.g., \"Page 1 of 1\"). The previous and next buttons are both disabled since all filtered results fit on one page.\n\n**Test: Pagination hidden when all transactions fit on one page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with very few transactions (e.g., 5 transactions when page size is 20).\n- **Action:** User observes the area below the TransactionsTable.\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are either hidden or displayed in a minimal state (e.g., \"Page 1 of 1\") since all transactions fit on a single page. The previous and next buttons are both disabled.\n\n#### Component: NewTransactionButton\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton displays with plus icon and text**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage.\n- **Action:** User observes the top-right area of the page header, to the right of the filter bar.\n- **Expected:** A \"New Transaction\" button is displayed with a blue/primary filled style. The button shows a plus icon (+) followed by the text \"New Transaction\". The button is prominently positioned for easy access.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton opens NewTransactionModal**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"New Transaction\" button.\n- **Expected:** The NewTransactionModal dialog opens, overlaying the TransactionsPage. The modal is in new transaction mode with empty fields (date defaulting to today, empty description, default currency USD, two empty line item rows). The user can fill in the transaction details and save.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton saving transaction updates table**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage and clicks the \"New Transaction\" button. The NewTransactionModal opens. User fills in: date \"Nov 5, 2023\", description \"Monthly Subscription\", selects \"Checking Account\" with Debit type and amount $15.99, selects \"Expenses\" with Credit type and amount $15.99, adds tag \"Recurring\".\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Save Transaction\" in the modal.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. The TransactionsPage returns to view. The new \"Monthly Subscription\" transaction appears in the TransactionsTable with the correct date, description, account, type, amount, and \"Recurring\" tag. The Pagination total updates to include the new transaction.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton cancelling does not affect table**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with a known set of transactions. User clicks the \"New Transaction\" button and begins filling in fields.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Cancel\" in the NewTransactionModal.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. The TransactionsTable remains unchanged with the same transactions as before the modal was opened. No new transaction is created.\n","numLines":121,"startLine":1480,"totalLines":1600}}}

Let me systematically check the testSpec.md directives against the NewTransactionModal test entries.\n\n## Directive 1: Systematically inventory every visible element\nLet me compare all visible elements in the components against test entries:\n\n**NewTransactionModal (modal-level):**\n- Title \"New Transaction\" ✓ (Test: displays title and close button)\n- X close button ✓ (Test: X button closes modal)\n- Cancel button ✓ (Test: Cancel button closes modal without saving)\n- Save Transaction button ✓ (Test: Save Transaction button saves transaction)\n\n\n- Cancel and Save positioned at bottom right ✓ (Test: Cancel and Save buttons positioned at bottom right)\n- Edit mode ✓ (Test: opens in edit mode, editing updates existing record)\n- Saved transaction appears in affected accounts ✓\n\n**TransactionHeaderFields:**\n- Date field ✓ (Test: displays Date field with calendar icon)\n- Date picker ✓ (Test: Date picker allows selecting a date)\n- Description input ✓ (Test: displays Description input with placeholder)\n- Description accepts text ✓ (Test: Description input accepts text)\n- Currency dropdown ✓ (Test: displays Currency dropdown with available options)\n- Currency selecting ✓ (Test: Currency dropdown allows selecting other currencies)\n- Layout ✓ (Test: layout shows Date, Description, Currency in a single row)\n\n**LineItemsTable:**\n- Section heading ✓\n- Column headers ✓\n- Account dropdown shows accounts with codes ✓\n- Account dropdown placeholder ✓\n- Type dropdown has Credit and Debit ✓\n- Type dropdown defaults to Debit ✓\n- Amount input accepts numeric values ✓\n- Delete row button ✓\n- Add Line Item button ✓\n- Multiple line items ✓\n- Initial state two empty rows ✓\n- Changing account ✓\n\nNow I'm checking the balance indicator to ensure it's calculating totals correctly and showing both balanced and unbalanced states.\n\n**TagsInput:**\n- Label with optional indicator ✓\n- Existing tags as removable chips ✓\n- Add a new tag ✓\n- Remove a tag ✓\n- Multiple tags ✓\n- Optional / saves without tags ✓\n- Tags persisted ✓\n\nLooking through the test coverage more carefully, I notice the NewTransactionModal has a submitting state that disables the button and shows \"Saving...\" text, but I don't see a test covering that loading state behavior. Also, I should double-check what else might be missing.\n\nThe removeLineItem function prevents deletion when there are only 2 rows left, and the delete button reflects this with a disabled state, but there's no explicit test verifying the button is disabled at that threshold. And I'm noticing there's no test for the description validation—the code checks that description isn't empty before allowing submission, but the only validation test I see is for unbalanced transactions.\n\nLet me go through the directives systematically to see what's actually being tested. Tags are persisted correctly. I've verified the button styling matches the design system—primary blue for Save, secondary outline for Cancel, plus icons on action buttons. The modal dialog lifecycle is fully tested: opening, closing via X or Cancel, saving, and edit mode all work. I'm now checking that state changes propagate correctly across the app, particularly verifying that newly saved transactions appear in the affected account lists.\n\nI'm spotting a data inconsistency in the test spec—the initial state shows the Rent Expense line item as Debit $1,500.00, but the expected result claims it should be $1,350.00 when viewing the AccountDetailPage. That's a mismatch that needs fixing in the test specification itself.\n\nNow I'm checking the default entry types for new line items. The code initializes the first row as Debit and the second as Credit, but I need to verify what the test actually expects versus what's being set up in the initial state. The initial two rows don't specify their type defaults in the test, which might be an oversight. Looking at the delete button behavior, the code prevents deletion when there are only two rows, but there's no test covering this constraint—that's a gap in the directive to systematically test every clickable element and its different states. Now examining the BalanceIndicator test for empty line items...\n\nthe expected outcome is vague, saying it either shows \"Transaction is Balanced\" or \"a neutral state,\" which violates the principle of being precise about outcomes. The NewTransactionButton test on TransactionsPage is more specific about initial modal state than the LineItemsTable test, even though they're testing the same thing on different pages. I should also check whether there's test coverage for the overlay behavior.\n\nLooking at the modal code, clicking the overlay triggers `onClose`, but the existing tests only cover the X button and Cancel button closing the modal—there's no test for clicking outside to close, which is standard modal behavior and should be covered per the directive about thoroughly testing modal dialogs. Additionally, the `handleSubmit` function validates that the description isn't empty, but there's no test verifying this validation works, only the unbalanced transaction test exists. The Save button should be tested to ensure it actually prevents submission when the description is missing.\n\nReviewing what constitutes actual violations versus nice-to-haves, there's a clear data inconsistency in the \"NewTransactionModal saved transaction appears in affected account transaction lists\" test—the initial state shows Rent Expense Debit at $1,500.00 but the expected result shows $1,350.00, which contradicts the setup.\n\nBeyond that, there are several missing test cases: the overlay click-to-close functionality isn't covered, the delete button's disabled state when only two line items remain isn't tested, and the Save button's disabled state when the description is empty only gets partial coverage. But I need to step back—the directive is to check whether the test specification entries themselves violate the requirements, not whether the implementation has untested features. So the real question is whether the test spec is complete according to its own stated directives. whether the code is correct.\n\nLet me re-read: \"During each checking subtask you need to read the skill document and all the directives, and then go through all the documentation / code you are checking to look for violations of those directives.\"\n\nFor CheckTestSpec, I'm checking the test entries in docs/tests.md against testSpec.md directives.\n\nSo violations would be:\n1. The $1,350 vs $1,500 inconsistency in the \"saved transaction appears\" test entry - this is an internal inconsistency in the test spec itself\n2. Missing test for clicking overlay to close - the code has this behavior but the test spec doesn't cover it\n3. Missing test for delete button disabled when ≤2 rows\n4. Missing test for Save button disabled when description is empty\n\nSince the test spec was meant to drive the code rather than the other way around, I should evaluate whether the test spec itself describes complete behavior for all interactive elements. Looking at what's actually documented, the delete button is tested in some scenarios, but the minimum-row constraint and the overlay-close behavior aren't explicitly covered in the test entries. and amount '$1,350.00'. But the initial state says the Rent Expense should be Debit $1,500.00, not $1,350.00 — that's a clear data mismatch in the test specification. Let me keep looking for other gaps in the test coverage. I'm noticing the third row is described as \"empty\" but actually has a type and amount specified—just no account selected. That's a bit of a misnomer in the wording, though the test itself seems valid since it's checking what happens when you delete a row with an unfilled account field.\n\nLooking at the test coverage for mutations, the create and edit transaction tests both verify that side effects occur correctly—account balances update when transactions are saved or modified. Now I need to check whether the app has a timeline or history feature that would require tracking these mutations.\n\nScanning through the app structure, I don't see a dedicated history or timeline feature for transactions. The TransactionsTab displays a list of transactions on the account detail page, but it's not a historical timeline, so that directive may not apply here.\n\nLet me wrap up my findings. I've identified two issues: first, there's a data inconsistency in the \"saved transaction appears\" test where the initial state shows Rent Expense as a $1,500 debit but the expected result lists it as $1,350—that's a factual error. Second, the modal testing is incomplete because it doesn't cover the standard interaction of clicking the overlay to close the modal, even though the code implements this behavior.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider my approach. The CheckTestSpec task is specifically about validating the test spec against the directives, not about comparing it to the implementation. The directives emphasize that the test spec should be derived from the app spec—the mockups and requirements—not from what the code happens to do. Since there's no AppSpec.md file, I should focus on whether the test spec itself is complete and consistent according to those directives. The key ones are systematically inventorying every visible element in the mockups and ensuring every clickable element has a specified navigation target or action result.\n\nLooking at the modal testing requirements, the spec says \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\" and lists tests for opening, closing via X button, closing via Cancel, saving, and edit mode. But overlay/backdrop click behavior is a standard part of modal testing that should be included. That's a gap against the directive to completely test modals. I should also verify the NewTransactionButton test accurately describes the initial state with two empty line item rows, and check whether there's coverage for attempting to save with no data.\n\nNow examining the BalanceIndicator validation test more closely—it uses \"either...or\" language to describe the Save button behavior, which violates the requirement that every clickable element's action result must be specific and unambiguous. The code shows the button is actually disabled based on the description validation, so the test spec should be precise about that rather than leaving it open-ended.\n\nI've identified two violations in the NewTransactionModal test entries: a data inconsistency where the initial Rent Expense amount doesn't match the expected amount, and the ambiguous \"either disabled or shows error\" language for the balance validation test when the actual behavior is specifically that the button gets disabled.\n\nI also notice the test suite is missing coverage for clicking the modal overlay to close it, which the directive requires for proper modal testing. As for the Save button's disabled state with empty descriptions—I need to reconsider whether that's actually a violation since there's no AppSpec defining description validation as a feature, so the test spec directive about interactive elements might not apply here if the feature itself isn't specified. I'm also noticing the BalanceIndicator test has an either/or condition that's equally vague—it could show \"Transaction is Balanced\" or just prompt the user to add items, which leaves the expected behavior unclear. Let me compile the final list of violations and create tasks for each

Systematically inventory every visible element\n2. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements\n3. For every clickable element, specify exact action result (no ambiguity)\n4. For any data mutation, verify persistence and side effects\n5. Button/control appearance matters\n6. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n\n### Checking modal-level tests:\n\n**Test: NewTransactionModal displays title and close button** (line 334) - Specifies title text and X button position. ✓\n\n**Test: NewTransactionModal X button closes modal** (line 339) - Specifies exact action result: modal closes, no save. ✓\n\n**Test: NewTransactionModal Cancel button closes modal without saving** (line 344) - Specifies exact result. ✓\n\n**Test: NewTransactionModal Save Transaction button saves transaction** (line 349) - Specifies persistence and side effects (appears in affected accounts, balances updated). ✓\n\n**Test: NewTransactionModal saved transaction appears in affected account transaction lists** (line 354-357) - **VIOLATION FOUND**: Initial state says `\"Rent Expense\" (Debit $1,500.00)` but Expected says Rent Expense shows amount `\"$1,350.00\"`. This is an internal data inconsistency — the amounts don't match.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionModal opens in edit mode with pre-populated fields** (line 359) - ✓\n\n**Test: NewTransactionModal editing a transaction updates existing record** (line 364) - Tests mutation, persistence, no duplication. ✓\n\n**Test: NewTransactionModal Cancel and Save buttons positioned at bottom right** (line 369) - Tests appearance/styling. ✓\n\n### Checking TransactionHeaderFields tests (lines 376-409):\nAll 7 entries checked — covers Date field, date picker, Description with placeholder, Description accepts text, Currency dropdown, Currency selection, and layout. ✓\n\n### Checking LineItemsTable tests (lines 411-471):\nAll 11 entries checked — covers section heading, column headers, Account dropdown, placeholder, Type dropdown options, Type defaults to Debit, Amount input, delete row, Add Line Item, multiple line items, initial two empty rows, changing account. ✓\n\n### Checking BalanceIndicator tests (lines 473-513):\n\n**Test: BalanceIndicator validation prevents saving unbalanced transaction** (line 500-503) - **VIOLATION FOUND**: Expected says \"The 'Save Transaction' button is either disabled while the transaction is unbalanced, or clicking it shows a validation error message\". This is ambiguous — the directive says \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact... action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\" The behavior should be one or the other, not \"either/or\".\n\n**Test: BalanceIndicator shows zero totals for empty line items** (line 505-508) - **VIOLATION FOUND**: Expected says 'The indicator shows \"Transaction is Balanced\" (since $0.00 = $0.00) or a neutral state prompting the user to add line items.' This is also ambiguous — \"or\" leaves the exact behavior unspecified.\n\nOther BalanceIndicator tests (lines 475-513): ✓\n\n### Checking TagsInput tests (lines 515-550):\nAll 7 entries checked — covers label, existing tags as chips, add tag, remove tag, multiple tags, optional field, tags persisted. ✓\n\n### Checking modal dialog completeness (directive: \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\"):\n\n**VIOLATION FOUND**: Missing test for clicking the modal overlay/backdrop to close. The NewTransactionModal is a modal dialog, and clicking outside the modal content (on the overlay) to close it is a standard modal interaction pattern. The test spec tests X button close and Cancel close, but does not test overlay/backdrop click-to-close.\n\n### Summary of violations found:\n\n1. **Data inconsistency** in \"saved transaction appears\" test (line 357): Rent Expense amount mismatch ($1,500 in initial state vs $1,350 in expected)\n2. **Ambiguous behavior** in \"prevents saving unbalanced\" test (line 503): \"either disabled...or shows error\" violates \"specify exact action result\"\n3. **Ambiguous behavior** in \"shows zero totals\" test (line 508): \"or a neutral state\" violates exact specification requirement\n4. **Missing overlay close test**: No test for clicking outside modal to close, violating \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\"\n\nNow let me add fix tasks for these violations."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6311,"cache_read_input_tokens":47542,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6311,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"51d2bd5f-e0f1-41da-a28e-2e1762fcdc32","uuid":"01a5159d-1d30-4088-bb0b-aa3e7d1795ce"}

The `overflow: hidden` is only on progress bars (budget-bar-bg) which don't have children with absolute positioning. Those are fine.\n\nNow let me also check the modal CSS: `.modal-content` has `overflow-y: auto` (line 681). If any child components of the modal use absolutely positioned dropdowns, the `overflow-y: auto` might clip them. The SearchableSelect dropdown is used in the modal (for currency, account, type). Let me check how SearchableSelect renders.\n\nActually, looking at the CSS:\n- `.modal-content` has `overflow-y: auto` (line 681). If SearchableSelect dropdowns open inside the modal content, they might be clipped by the overflow. However, this isn't `overflow: hidden` — it's `overflow-y: auto` which shows scrollbars but still clips content that extends beyond. This could be an issue if dropdowns try to extend beyond the modal.\n\n\n- The directive specifically prohibits `overflow: hidden` on containers with absolutely-positioned children, not `overflow-y: auto`, so this technically doesn't violate the rule.\n\nNow let me look at the hardcoded colors. The directive requires domain-specific colors like status badge colors to be defined as CSS variables in the @theme block rather than hardcoded in component files. Looking at the rgba values in the codebase, they're all in the CSS file itself, not scattered across component files, and most are for generic hover states.\n\nBut I'm noticing some colors around lines 537-542 — `#f5e3e3` and `#e6ede8` — that look like they could be badge colors, which would be domain-specific. Let me examine what selectors these are applied to.","signature":"ErYQCkYICxgCKkAvpIKEMy535tfRccT/jpjxKnHz4vEj+p/QLcF+xP7qkJfeFW6P9EvyrvsF7nqxht54AAIb1Q3/qfkhC7ySnGcYEgxwpIjbM5A8hVmONOAaDDHEnCoxN0GxK0+OViIwKyr11ogl9i0NR/2qTD6c481PK3jfvAywp35BWp7zvKNUNXDzD1n6ASAetZbg1An+Kp0PVTriHUj/zmobigFnDBgX1akPbjq8BEjrquDsEQ9+9CZd0I/4zzQzjo2W07tIYET+P/tXgwrGuNWb73yNhigCUqxHB/mRtdmbh1atxWOIg6yhVXMYPG6K4DKjRN0MuKOPGP+XZbDwFWumg5xcpl4lgT8RuRMooXtHFMBSMV1IRXh/SP24h76bSX1SNNe0hHg+nTJgvtyJVDAlsK+i4lVEm1QP3eO/2hozJGS6sDldzt0npocj4HZ6I+3rPNLrogOr1YRjzuD0h2+QX94XidHcD1mH2bvND8q+AnFWSuJeLTtOPeg/vs0Vga7skUAZpwkEy8PnrNcGpImqfnOJ/UiAS5lNhkcawNMxVpJVrL/gTO7yGaHScRJVB4lGVlPaNIvq1G2kVdWjs2npb1ZFOY7eHKSvpnazNc+q+dahIziC8w0P+nmHE0xSCQAQTQ13O4d6nc8czIFth4fMLZXknVOy5fz1YX9IlcZWxd7+ACHZxPQBYHaBNyxpBxQ9OQXZqHoXEIJABhB6RvwHWqga1RW20rCHw1FalBfdrsWU3TyHGZ64JmO4x8CsD9NIfYh7bbS44ypXM3zzo+zan5JrQ40iVY8KVGArlVU7tvKgHSqEdhdPWrSBLInbIJsEqAGi7i8h3Lixyl2GfCjH3UZV6K87Ti3MddquocEJAxRyz0fEdLbhbgTUNMxSvFrDdkjIfpupIjOUwGxq9QgdE5XmhRjzPp7xnEE1yzvz8nFfdQutLy9fIRpVZ8ojWSeEAd15PJuamp9qr3ozJmwa0cgrdfRlTbOOUk7IFp6kYruf7eR1LnNl8Aecpfp155K88Go1M1TwBuF0V6e8IHNDULa8ExQSB8nO1WUgBx9T7G24mXvp2nGZYimTzp8/Hrsn8DDHEzOiRkew7/7T+UXaZPVm4OzT6Wafx2iZ82fBuEq7danD++7/bkMJLrknk0L3hQpxKJc1tv8GlzjAwIV2J72zIue7mCl8RKUtFQxylTWNO5DJQtcpkO4+DlqdDum/EAvBhZ+qJpitQDHgvm0j5RiPU1NUPgxVLewqG3ylj4ZrBbqyGvEUryAznNAVz4KD2b+BvdolPUkk9gbVE+wfalupk3jaZZLVgMf3KXX+MmyXmjuMKyh9SYp/W90y9BHS3oVm2zgmX9s22Pvun7gYG9ob/gNslyuq93wXYHqoRpd3V178mSb7kShUtHXaGyprESZqcQb0EfiCwWMi7NVu+1yRWyTvNhHGC8r+UV/C7N0Io9OfuRR0P9KpQUJl3pHWG4LmamdGo7/9EkrSLRggk7fbxlI33+9n1T5KM3Ewyq3ACY9BImYZJ2FYyMmNmfvSxP36wPtxuKGkXFaaQLJsWncB/vpqjlgESkPi2w8iLzlbYEShcyIbalH6ynWFqg01hEpLOmi8I/tNSN5yU3X07WEUEuIOyA28wfrHG6x1sKn+hw/bFzAUCpxGnzoEvWXxGdrMmALYPjujG3XSCI8sor0mNr7k/4BIb3C9TRWcFrjVzfUh7mQQMgx0JQ45jSz903iQWbqfLyFzBNBrEqAQT9jEC3TBgBIhWvKvKoluSOjr/zZMI+q0mxOSecw9jLkAyhi/8jkYPddb3nX1Cgx3P0dnwnVhIyVGZXCF6Hx+xL7K1LZo/uhxuARSutHbVbw9EYkf5CZXSMZy6pv/5d0gDk7osmyJsW/AQC3THE65elhC06JHo6L98qXYiZAvs3miVTp/1nqCkBiqqN00C1Tjs3ijPCT/4B7HQzeImk4RMD7KHsCiwt02AI4arlBThQFTIqhUaU0mUUqAAvSh6uE7Qt/YtsRMQy4Megcz3jsObwBHj6TI/j8aalVqR/jzeXBy2681cTEqW6MDfSj8McicxaaeKTH9h8/BlG8/ldZ/iVebmP4Pac1W4550fQ6/3NmRicQreMAVKnDabvW+UhdNKjJi/Lwz7gzyHey0uwnuiR1alDTpFylOSYVAaTbSvgl4nCD5KjTlovQ3nVVWRktLWmAszL61E700XA6W3Rquh+Fh2eZMKg8tuhFECjYq+9i9XD/+ckwFziMzqvSHmRsBbHgQw8YgEaFvSAoq3oiQy3saxsIf9rOA/uVjEzeyYHzRYv+rycwrJ/yLOlZJKAfwF9qHAk8w56jsVAuEubK4eCBkim0Izme7PqArRqodg/s/SJSQse9MO3xqHYtJZ9pCq0VMVXkDod2JC07JCYYjLcZgqCXEKririm4o9zPb96M27rVQYzcVnczi3hyNY6rVUF0Z9zu6ig1f7FdRzoL0T7VB7x9OrIZW4ACPi24Zz135njtOIZm4tiVKhbMOXk6JUQngOd0XrBD1wxqycJjKwmsUn41BgtAowbPm/WxOHZrFBd3XF5mC8cQi5s1T6K5zHuE22FjgnvDFxGGaUAjLlaQCe+O2aFeLkl3Da4nI89TynGZU2niUCoDSE9GXFez5kGH8ZXHEXkXQh9Gd/Pwk7VEjykP1rw5xAyTAAIqP18Muev8dO+QHlE6I3mU8300oymj9i7PVvEx50e4D8alwDRZ1FOrI67laZZD8mZq8yOMo2tsTAzSPkpNWlIbxoX3IrRRxOhoAA+pofAburpL//bI28HsYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1455,"cache_read_input_tokens":74524,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1455,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"51d2bd5f-e0f1-41da-a28e-2e1762fcdc32","uuid":"e6a0d57d-6173-4385-8c8a-bdb286f6ea68"}

Lines 537 and 542 have hardcoded hex colors `#f5e3e3` and `#e6ede8` for transaction direction (debit/credit) styling. These are domain-specific colors that should be defined as CSS variables per the directive.\n\nHowever, these styles are for `.transaction-direction--debit` and `.transaction-direction--credit` which are used in the TransactionsTab component on the AccountDetailPage, not in the NewTransactionModal specifically. Let me check if these are used in any NewTransactionModal components...\n\nActually, looking at the scope of my check: I'm checking \"writeApp.md directive violations in NewTransactionModal components\". \n\nThe `.transaction-direction--debit` and `.transaction-direction--credit` classes aren't actually used in any of the NewTransactionModal components—they're only in TransactionsTab for displaying transaction rows, so this isn't a violation within my scope. Now I'm looking at the modal-specific hardcoded colors, like the overlay background at line 667 which uses a generic rgba black with opacity, and checking what else might be domain-specific styling that needs to be converted to CSS variables.\n\nI realize I need to clarify which directive I'm actually checking—the writeApp.md directive about test comments in JSX, not the testSpec.md one I already reviewed. Let me look at what writeApp.md actually requires about connecting components to their test entries.\n\nNow I'm verifying that the component code satisfies each test requirement: the close button with an X SVG matches the spec, the button styles use the correct primary and secondary classes, and the date input field is properly implemented with the calendar icon. I'm working through each test case to confirm the code meets the stated requirements. The account formatting matches the expected pattern, the Type field correctly defaults to Debit for new entries, and the Add Line Item button displays with the proper icon and text. Tags are rendered as removable chips, and the optional label is present as required.\n\nNow I'm checking the delete button implementation against the test spec. The test expects a trash icon, but looking at the code, the delete button uses an X-shaped SVG icon instead of a trash icon—this is a mismatch between what the spec requires and what's currently implemented. I'm noticing a mismatch between what the tests expect and what's actually implemented—the code shows an X icon but the test spec consistently refers to a trash icon for the delete button. This violates the directive to match visual elements to the mockup and ensure test requirements are satisfied by the app code. I should also verify whether the JSX comments documenting which tests exercise each interactive element are present, since that's a separate requirement from the icon itself. a violation of the testSpec.md requirements. Since I already evaluated this in the first subtask and didn't flag it, I need to reconsider whether the JSX comment directive applies here—it's a testSpec.md requirement about what the test spec author should ensure, not a writeApp.md directive for the component code itself. the JSX comment issue is a systemic problem across the codebase rather than specific to this component, so I'll set it aside and focus on the clear, actionable violations. For the writeApp.md check, I've identified that LineItemsTable uses an X icon instead of the trash icon specified in the test entries, which violates the visual appearance requirement. I'm now compiling the remaining violations from this check. The `overflow-y: auto` on the modal content shouldn't be an issue since SearchableSelect likely handles positioning independently. I'm also reconsidering the JSX comments directive — it's actually in testSpec.md, not writeApp.md, so it may not apply here. What matters more is ensuring the component behavior matches the test requirements, so let me verify that the delete button actually removes line items as expected.\n\nI'm checking the test cases now: the delete functionality works correctly for removing rows when there are more than two, but I notice the test expects a trash icon while the code shows an X icon — that's a mismatch. I also need to verify the initial state of new transactions, which should have two empty rows with debit and credit types pre-selected, though the test description doesn't explicitly specify that the types should differ between the two rows. I think the \"empty\" description in the test probably just refers to the Account and Amount fields being blank, while the Type dropdown having a default value is expected. That makes sense — the Type field always needs a value. Let me move forward.\n\nI'm also noticing the code prevents removing line items when there are 2 or fewer, which is a reasonable constraint even though the test spec doesn't explicitly cover it. That's not a violation of the implementation itself.\n\nSo my main finding here is that the delete button uses an X icon instead of the trash icon specified in the tests, which violates the visual appearance requirement. But now I'm also checking the BalanceIndicator labels — the test expects \"Total Debits:\" and \"Total Credits:\" with colons, but the code renders them without colons, which is another mismatch with the spec. I'm noticing a mismatch between the test specifications and the actual component code — the tests expect \"Total Debits:\" and \"Total Credits:\" with colons, but the component renders them without colons. The test description explicitly states the label text should include the colon, so this is a violation of the entry requirements that needs to be fixed in the component. I've verified the other text elements match the test requirements, so I'm left with two clear violations: the delete button uses an X icon instead of a trash icon, and the \"Total Debits\" and \"Total

Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"51d2bd5f-e0f1-41da-a28e-2e1762fcdc32","uuid":"b1bcca98-a0a9-44f5-a970-dd7747050867","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

The key finding so far is that there's no dedicated test file for the NewTransactionModal page/section at all! The docs/tests.md has 30+ test entries under \"## Page: NewTransactionModal\" but only the \"NavBar New Transaction button opens NewTransactionModal\" test is implemented (in accounts-page.spec.ts), and a basic deployment test.\n\nThe NewTransactionModal section in docs/tests.md has tests for:\n- Modal-level tests (8 tests)\n- TransactionHeaderFields (7 tests)\n- LineItemsTable (11 tests)\n\n\n- BalanceIndicator (8 tests)\n- TagsInput (7 tests)\n\nNone of these tests exist as Playwright tests except the NavBar button test that just opens the modal. So my actual task is to check the existing test code against the directives in writeTests.md, and note where tests are missing or don't follow the documented requirements.\n\nLooking at the directives: tests must verify navigation targets precisely by asserting URLs or page content, avoid getByText() with common words, keep data-testid values consistent across files, never put Playwright locators with auto-wait inside .toPass() blocks, and skip unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach hooks. Let me scan through the test files to see which directives are being violated.\n\nThe NavBar test checks modal visibility but doesn't test actual navigation, which is fine since it's a modal. The test titles match their entries in the documentation. Timeouts are generous at 30000 for page loads and 10000 for modals. But here's the critical issue: there are no Playwright tests at all for the 41 test entries listed under \"Page: NewTransactionModal\" in the docs, and the TransactionsPage references NewTransactionModal in several entries without corresponding test coverage.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1255,"cache_read_input_tokens":94981,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1255,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"51d2bd5f-e0f1-41da-a28e-2e1762fcdc32","uuid":"4fe3d8dc-ce91-4d66-878f-913d2bb91590"}

The existing tests follow the directives well.\n\nThe main issue is that there are no Playwright tests at all for the NewTransactionModal page section. The docs/tests.md has 41 test entries under \"Page: NewTransactionModal\" (modal-level tests, TransactionHeaderFields, LineItemsTable, BalanceIndicator, TagsInput) and none of them have corresponding Playwright tests.\n\nAlso, looking at the TransactionsPage section in docs/tests.md, many of its test entries reference NewTransactionModal (e.g., row click opens NewTransactionModal, NewTransactionButton opens NewTransactionModal, etc.) - and there are no TransactionsPage tests either.\n\n\nThe real question is whether missing tests constitute a directive violation. The writeTests.md guidelines focus on how to write tests correctly - avoiding anti-patterns, verifying navigation precisely, etc. - but if no tests exist yet, there's nothing to violate. However, the core requirement is that all test entries in docs/tests.md should have corresponding Playwright tests, so the absence itself is the violation.\n\nLooking at the deployment test that does interact with NewTransactionModal, it properly uses data-testid selectors throughout and includes appropriate timeouts, so there are no directive violations in the existing code. The real gap is that the entire NewTransactionModal test suite is missing.\n\nI should flag this missing test coverage as a finding and create fix tasks to address it, rather than treating it as a directive violation since the few tests that do exist follow the rules correctly.\n\nNow looking at the NavBar button test more carefully - it's properly using data-testids throughout and includes appropriate visibility checks with timeouts.\n\nThere's a potential gap though: the test spec mentions the button should display both a plus icon and text, but the test only verifies the text content. Checking for the icon specifically might be overly granular for a Playwright test, though the writeTests directive does emphasize testing exact field interactions described in specs. Since this is testing the NavBar component itself rather than the NewTransaction modal, the text verification probably captures the essential behavior adequately.\n\nThe real issue is that there are no Playwright tests at all for the 41 test entries listed under \"Page: NewTransactionModal\" — they all need to be written from
