These are logs of previous analysis tasks, not the logs I need to analyze for shell commands. The logs I need to analyze are:\n\n1. logs/worker-app-building-0f55gu-12-2026-02-28T20-49-52-972Z.log\n2. logs/worker-app-building-0f55gu-13-2026-02-28T20-52-52-354Z.log\n3. logs/worker-app-building-0f55gu-14-2026-02-28T20-55-14-100Z.log\n\n\n4. logs/worker-app-building-0f55gu-15-2026-02-28T20-56-55-053Z.log\n5. logs/worker-app-building-0f55gu-16-2026-02-28T20-58-46-855Z.log\n\nThese are all AnalyzeGroup tasks that run `npm run read-log` on various other logs and generate analysis files. I need to extract the shell commands from each one, then read through the remaining logs while starting to write out the analysis files for the first batch.\n\nLooking at log 12 specifically, I can see it creates the reports directory, runs multiple read-log commands to analyze different worker logs, and then writes the analysis output files. The key is distinguishing between the actual shell commands executed versus the tool calls the assistant made. Reading through more worker logs to gather the test failure data... I see the distinction now—the read-log commands are showing me the contents of those inner logs, but the actual commands executed in this outer session are separate. I need to extract only the shell commands that the agent itself ran, not the commands displayed within the logs it was reading. So for this session, the real command is just the mkdir operation to create the reports directory. Looking at logs 12 through 14, I'm seeing a consistent pattern where the agent runs an AnalyzeGroup command for the testFailures report, creates the reports directory, then reads through 10 different log files. Each of these sessions completed without any issues. The agent is continuing through the remaining test failure logs, running the same directory creation and log reading commands for another batch. Once these final five logs are processed, I'll be ready to compile all the analysis

Let me summarize the shell commands from each log and write the analysis files.\n\n**Log 12 (0f55gu-12)**: AnalyzeGroup for testFailures report (analyzed 10 inner logs)\nShell commands run by the agent in this session:\n1. `mkdir -p /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-analysis`\n2-11. `npm run read-log <log>` x10 (with `2>/dev/null` suffix)\nTotal: 11 shell commands, all successful, no difficulty.\n\n\n**Log 13 (0f55gu-13)**: Same pattern—created the reports directory and ran 10 log reads, all completing without issues. **Log 14 (0f55gu-14)**: Following the same AnalyzeGroup workflow for the testFailures report with another batch of 10 inner logs being processed. The agent continues processing the testFailures report through additional analysis groups, running the same directory creation and log-reading commands with slightly different output filtering options to capture up to 3000 lines per log file. Now I'm looking at the next phase where the agent is unpacking the test failures report—it's listing the log files in the repository, creating the reports directory, counting how many logs exist, and then building a file list to process.\n\nThe agent ran into trouble with a shell script that was supposed to group the logs together; it created a lot of empty groups, so there was a cleanup step using Node to filter out the invalid tasks and keep only the ones with actual content. That took some debugging.\n\nThen it moved into analyzing individual groups of logs from the test failures report, starting with the directory setup for storing the results.","signature":"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
