Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n    25→\n    26→4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n    27→   test data.\n    28→\n    29→5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n    30→   prior runs.\n    31→\n    32→6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n    33→   specified test file.

Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n    38→      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n    39→      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n    40→   b.

On success, log `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n    51→      On failure, log the exit code.\n    52→\n    53→8. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch.

This is the single entry point for running\ntests during development and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n   previous runs.\n\n2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n\n3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n\n4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n   test data.\n\n5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n   prior runs.\n\n6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n   `DATABASE_URL`. Capture the exit code.\n\n7. **On failure** (non-zero exit code):\n   a. Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n   b. Log full metadata for every recording that has test metadata in a delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, log `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n      On failure, log the exit code.\n\n8. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n9. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: Playwright test output, recording metadata block, upload confirmations.\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON. The\n  `addMetadata` entries contain `metadata.test.result` which indicates pass/fail.\n- The Playwright config must use the Replay browser via `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n  from `@replayio/playwright` and include `replayReporter` with `upload: false`.\n- The HTML reporter must use `open: 'never'` to suppress the interactive \"Serving HTML report\"\n  prompt that blocks the script from exiting.\n- Run Playwright with `--retries 0` — no retries. Failures must be analyzed via Replay.\n- Use `child_process.execSync` or `execFileSync` for subprocess calls, inheriting stdio for\n  Playwright output.\n- The `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` env var is already set in the container.\n","numLines":99,"startLine":1,"totalLines":99}}}

Let me also check if there's a `seed-db.md` design doc - it seems it doesn't exist. The seed-db subtask tells me to implement it. Let me check the app's types to understand what seed data to create, and check the Accounting seed-db for the pattern.\n\nLooking at the schema, I need to seed:\n1. `accounts` - stock, input, output accounts\n2. `material_categories` - categories like Raw Materials, Finished Goods, Packaging\n3. `materials` - items in inventory\n4. `batches` - material subdivisions within accounts\n\n\n5. `transactions` - double-entry transactions\n6. `quantity_transfers` - line items\n7. `batches_created` - batches produced by transactions\n8. `batch_lineage` - source batches used to create new batches\n9. `dismissed_alerts` - dismissed low inventory alerts\n\nNow I'm checking if InventoryTracker has a `vite.config.ts` to understand the build settings, and I'll reference the Accounting app's configuration for sourcemap and React dev build patterns. I also need to see if there's a `migrate-db.ts` file in InventoryTracker.\n\nFor the seed-db script, there's no design doc in skills/scripts/, so I'll need to follow the pattern from the Accounting app's seed-db.ts, which takes a DATABASE_URL, clears existing data, inserts seed data, and exits. Looking at the AppSpec.md for InventoryTracker will help me understand what seed data makes sense for the domain.\n\nThe writeScript skill mentions reading `skills/scripts/<script-name>.md` for each script's purpose, but seed-db doesn't have one, so I'll need to infer the requirements from the schema and existing patterns.","signature":"EssRCkYICxgCKkCX4wej1vCsmvSrr4PbfkNXVfLPQdHP7jLotal6lV3UnyWIiqJzd9w6eooKiM+2VLrmrFDIJdJpDJw1Fyz1NqLNEgy2an+Ch/SF6z52amwaDIUj9hJNU9am3w74/iIw1sJ0VZJe13qq7qPuzPxHt2gedub80n6wJz3EzJm4WQKgZjjsag1XOjCpAfL2DJYKKrIQq6uCyqoPHSv6FQbRmtSHi4KNzX6AhaArc/FY440PcIXqbR5VyqUG/o3n/qqz97zao/gmygiftmiFUk0Kajc7mDKPZk3ImVjQpZ4eCzOVvuv/yhGYDPi235s9U+proTgQCZw3vTnlUd/xSufD+4/AiJTRZ6sSJcZsLUyBDIOTVSq++TkGhVgmCZulKqz6+iaf+ZGSsq8P9Sa4gFO2vQUU871p2DHjcmckadgFNU8o3bmmrvpqHvLChYZexp7cnGE/5Io54uM5ZIeiWvT9IG+tSWF+t0YDppah37CqezFglph6kIZATz+TfOioCm47aPxqGCtDLQEz1K9f8rZJP3GgA/kzT6gei7smVYvWj9ysw/UptNlXN4/+taLH1f01svIs4pJdfhbucWbbvkAiTZVwH1uPmB6+aJ3A3LcIvK7YBwjlfwlvGe4US4ODmEhm5fSEUSeSJ90MaVDXJ9pYeMwPboAk4NZMA5B+Jge9/Ad09G9ijKtRHEHMhn/a81oPJg21YI3qaBWXPZ3H5BQzAsPWkFSCngCBVgk2h+i7Kz4yCTjeqIlDgLdHq/01Hio1K1auq+rSkaUdY3KRR2yYR8vYpTY5C4ZXKEBSm/GGUgt6dwDBXC19bW19EdYHD/gK2QsCnczEzYdXHpltaiMCjD30wKuOY0J1vrIJhdEiHozZMVc5W05VyhEisV5SVNKukrH1QIL5PZAqu25Le48l9uaYsSda5ME3ZurzwUqU4szu4+JBce7ROtSGGylf53TbvaHk3UBiXPHmacJei1yNNXdWw3sj9ZAWky9FMoN96g+NXg7rVCDQj3Vhm4D74scUqsOG9KA/KEo5m5cC914m8dDjizjdnXZt8dp2f2tGfHDBTZYHgyOZ5RctVzOfLvLhG9KQAz8MZWmvydYwX+YrPw3fDR4jyNzJ/qbvVyiIVOgcrXWpZSefRI4hU+8lytXDkptEVCHPCRhN6ss8Du1w3AgH7qPTw3RyD+XeZzsqg0R9k3iBXGY+XluCiWkLFtSrT/lIMDOoe2b+mYrrmQpRbMct/HZqpLRSTGggwyALcxdXOjrWCCAf3rwlA0zXNY9SQOvHvm4jLxe85rFc2BY0XlSXKe3PqCGBe16MQAu6rd4V0brPz7V9vMdRc6nySV/iBg1rE8Og4qAWRMtc0m21q1HxFBPLevF7W0AtqAH3KM0ig13h3zaK+UyqIM7SPMUFZFHhfLLWJvY2rb3ALDM7u2It/j8x0c1q7gO3EG6mJTey79yWGHI5tsmQHc0gpiXU671UL9dM1/9t2GcpfCOIl5qb9g8FTPHDlAhNykzgRTiBcr16ml8DuqPtTO9tYY2//Gq5VDNd9FGuosmArezJSvlw1P2AcELqp/ISDCD4oLfJGl4cwRojqVlVWAs3KdDymHTvqJydQdJz2wchO7L0GAQMC5knduG+flMrP7Azg/ok7s1s84nOEL17nH2GO7RfkwrgFikFw5BhlWFYSEtkLRkIxc4JrLCRQVe/znyLU0FDU4PMMJcTt/vgFJzYRnaB7P/ByzE+YsV7laAOzCyj2HyamALa9f3zpy/ZNjufDPuCD6bKETXlsoKzC5nqxkHq0VSggRCuOUs9lef5sH6Aqljx19kkay7cG3VqPrX600ptX4d+UaDL+MBk/akjiTBKE1siZKgIXiIOjfYSBCp16BG0KO64ENGC3FifSI6jZaE+cgm/P7dC+JlWYBdCeRLetxE1CG+ETz0ApDmTw45ovxy081ZU+Euaj66tn2pcJ1d0Wr32JWUAuXhR+pg7EVHEE9e1f8c9Dsy0h83ipQO6ZghtytFB4/Krw3xp8ltpjVhW07SncBrtqTl1qtkOw+GK8wQ9Xo/F14DVVb1hiaMa4vPnyKA69il73TtN9u2uCw1pmnzn4C4dcwrVhUR3+K08zVtTb2x8YxygcFc0kDmaSQJCcHOzk5aplD3nqEiaMlCFp/2E1Z1Vhuv7kkp4yvIMTCyVtsfJYnjKunnweNq3IIw8Cts9MYFoP2li3XjbynQoAU1edmpUBU1mIasO3ay1v0irKO6o92zioVNK0B7N8lO31GoYijzXUJ+avQesT4rgL6JsbjqbLrhY97KlYb1eUy/0rOx5nAgq/WZjpJDhilXrxZZehnnwta2f+mo8yreQhOKtRGCHOFP+Uf2T5hEq6Gaksa0MxO65ZCSayNiAYg314WYZmpLAQp6ur/MATeZPtngW4SMNlILoJlyD07NCOFEwCpzrEz6BcVfvqRBdXFy/6dD5trkNAEvs3Pa0xZrzHGZWqyhNE+U7hozKG3hgA5lYZRYotZBClHtyN7kjGJO9YKvMDEo7+amcTCNjZjMY0BspQGqR5GUPqhAAL/+kCo1RsZfeOZGF0PnNW/A7yeOdYo/ZC+b6xx5xdfo4X9Yd5LSp2w01cOfVNB4w6mkXoapTFa80c8liHV1O8WfDaZeH4uQ5saoSIPjurvk+mbh5a60o+r3lLyxPG8o+XZBKNaOWoWLUhgOnKgV19XWDIintIqrllj6cc8Ig7DmzvpeqEc7JoEkeN50BL7BRk4Sg9IpEIzUdP5Nngu2BxDcknLd7A1oI4Mcc1zBaXSmmh68P731jJOcbftfwWOroWCWDmMuT+qu7zJ90X5B8M2kyJsYPlxBmUWWcRJiSOJAGTdRoF55H63iErYqzxA20Siwh870fINwdTGbFMMqKnwwog631+h1WaTwDWApg9qFAQgIk/ESBsVfb3P7xY7pnaGStjEoqSEBsgWmofifiqIrII8EgEyPBISINL6q+i/WJJRr5sk0+4hgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11722,"cache_read_input_tokens":33520,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11722,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1e17377c-83b6-4f84-a020-7b5a29c4dde2","uuid":"c31e198d-7372-47ce-a80d-530986d0830c"}

The deploy script still needs to reference the functions directory though. Let me also check Accounting's Netlify functions directory for reference to see the pattern they use.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully, the netlify.toml mentions `functions = \"netlify/functions\"`, so the deploy command should still reference `--functions ./netlify/functions` but it might not have any functions yet. That's fine - the directory just might not exist or be empty.\n\nNow I have everything I need. Let me implement the three scripts:\n\n1. **deploy.ts** - Based on the deploy.md skill and the Accounting deploy.ts reference\n\n\n2. **seed-db.ts** - Based on the Accounting seed-db.ts pattern, adapted for InventoryTracker schema\n3. **test.ts** - Based on the test.md skill and the Accounting test.ts reference\n\nThe deploy and test scripts will be straightforward adaptations from Accounting with just the app name changed. For seed-db, I need to tailor it to the InventoryTracker schema, populating accounts with stock/input/output types, material categories, materials that reference those categories, and batches that reference materials.\n\nI need to be careful about foreign key ordering—categories before materials, accounts and materials before batches, then transactions and quantity transfers. Let me write all three scripts now, starting with deploy.ts which uses `runMigrations` from schema.ts rather than a separate migration file.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":78,"cache_read_input_tokens":48221,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":78,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1e17377c-83b6-4f84-a020-7b5a29c4dde2","uuid":"bddab7ba-a9dc-46fd-b63b-cc978f5c43c9"}
