detail page\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\" which is associated with client \"Acme Corp\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"View Details\"\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for \"Acme Corp\"\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Edit\" opens task edit dialog\n- **Given** the action menu is open for a task\n- **When** the user clicks \"Edit\"\n- **Then** an edit dialog opens pre-populated with the task's current data (name, due date, priority, assignee, client, deal)\n- **When** the user changes the priority from

For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

Let me analyze what I see:\n\n**PersonHeader:**\n- Name: \"Dr. Anya Sharma\" (large, bold)\n- Title: \"Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\" \n- Associations: \"Innovate Solutions Inc. & FutureTech Corp.\"\n- Email: \"anya.sharma@example.com\" (with email icon)\n- Phone: \"+1 (555) 123-4567\" (with phone icon)\n- Location: \"San Francisco, CA\" (with location pin icon)\n- Associated Clients: \"Innovate Solutions Inc., FutureTech Corp.\" (as clickable links)\n\n\n- Below that is a relationships section with toggle options between graph and list views, plus filtering and add entry capabilities. The list shows her connections—colleagues, decision makers, and influencers—each with their role and affiliated organization.\n\nNow I'm looking at the contact history section, which tracks interactions chronologically with timestamps, interaction types like video calls and emails, brief summaries of what was discussed, and which team member was involved. The entries span from late October, showing various touchpoints with different team members handling different aspects of the relationship.\n\nI'm also seeing the associated clients section below that, displaying client cards with their current status and industry information, along with quick links to view more details about each client.\n\nLet me cross-reference this against the component structure from the tests to make sure I'm capturing the right sections and their elements accurately.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the test cases I need to write for each component, starting with the PersonHeader which should verify that the name displays prominently, the title and associations are shown, and all the contact information icons render correctly with their respective data. I also need to test that the associated clients links are functional and navigate to the right detail pages.\n\nFor the RelationshipsSection, I'm planning tests to confirm the heading appears, both view tabs are available, and List View is the default active state.  I need to verify each relationship entry displays the person's name in bold along with the relationship type, title, and client information, plus test that the Filter and Add Entry buttons work as expected. I should also cover the Graph View functionality and the ability to switch between views seamlessly.\n\nFor the ContactHistorySection, I'm checking that the heading displays correctly and entries appear in reverse chronological order with date/time and interaction type visible. I'm finishing up the Associated Clients section tests, then moving on to detail the PersonHeader component—I need to capture all the visual elements like the name styling, job title, contact information with icons, and the client links displayed below. Now I'm identifying the key testing requirements—making sure every interactive element, navigation link, dialog action, and state change is covered with proper verification of side
