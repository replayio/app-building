A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout.

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    99→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   100→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   101→\n   102→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   103→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   104→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   105→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   106→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   107→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   108→\n   109→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   110→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   111→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   112→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   113→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   114→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   115→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

So the only tests defined so far are for the DashboardPage.\n\nLooking at the tests.md file, I need to unpack the tests into subtasks. The skill says to add one task per page containing all test entries for that page. Since only the DashboardPage has defined tests, I need to create subtasks for those.\n\nLet me group the test entries by component/section within the DashboardPage:\n\n1. NavigationHeader (7 tests)\n2. LowInventoryAlerts (6 tests)\n\n\n3. MaterialsCategoriesOverview (6 tests)\n4. RecentTransactionsTable (7 tests)\n5. DateRangeFilter (3 tests)\n6. CategoryFilter (4 tests)\n7. NewTransactionButton (2 tests)\n\nThe skill says to add one task per page with all test entries, but that's 35 tests for the Dashboard alone. Let me reconsider whether I should break these down by component instead, since that would make each task more manageable. I see the example shows each test entry becomes its own subtask. Looking at the DashboardPage test entries, I need to create a subtask for each of the 13 test cases listed, from the navigation header display through the low inventory alerts functionality.\n\nNow I'm continuing with the remaining test cases: the materials categories overview section with its category columns, material samples, and navigation links, plus the recent transactions table with its headers, data rows, and filtering capabilities, along with the date range filter display.\n\nLooking at the next batch of tests, I need to cover the interactive elements—the date picker calendar, category dropdown filter with its default and reset behavior, and the prominent New Transaction button that navigates to the transaction creation page. That brings the total to 35 test cases for the Dashboard, which aligns with the skill requirement of one task per page with all its subtasks included.\n\nNow I'm working through how to structure these as subtasks. The skill is clear about the format, so I'll create identifiers for each test and follow the pattern of \"WriteTest[Name]: Write test for [description]\". I'm starting with the navigation header tests and will continue through all the Dashboard interactions systematically. Now I'm mapping out the remaining test cases for the low inventory alerts—dismissing alerts, triggering reorders with pre-filled data, and handling the empty state—followed by tests for the materials categories overview section that verify the display of category summaries, item counts, and navigation to individual materials.\n\nContinuing with the categories overview, I need to test the View All link navigation and how the section updates when filters are applied, then move into the recent transactions table tests covering headers, data display, chronological ordering, and the various navigation links to detail and full transaction pages.\n\nNow I'm mapping out tests for the date range and category filters themselves—checking that the date picker opens correctly and updates all widgets when a new range is selected, and verifying the category dropdown displays all available options and properly filters the dashboard content.\n\nI realize this is getting unwieldy with 35 subtasks total for just the Dashboard page. The instructions say one task per page, so I should bundle all of these as subtasks under a single Dashboard test task, even though it'll be a lengthy command to
