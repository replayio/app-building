Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    97→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    98→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    99→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   100→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   101→\n   102→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   103→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   104→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   105→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   106→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   107→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   108→\n   109→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   110→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   111→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   112→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   113→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   114→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   115→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   116→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   117→\n   118→## Parallel Test Design\n   119→\n   120→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   121→Write tests with this in mind:\n   122→\n   123→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   124→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   125→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   126→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   127→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   128→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   129→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   130→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   131→  being unmodified.\n   132→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   133→  you need to interact with.\n   134→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   135→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   136→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   137→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   138→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   139→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   140→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load.
