There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    80→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    81→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01Cdvdc7U8CnSWD6cE325W3W","session_id":"3952cd7d-7856-4a9b-a1db-02583339dc3e","uuid":"87a83c34-2234-48e7-a85c-9c79dded501f"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01Cdvdc7U8CnSWD6cE325W3W","session_id":"3952cd7d-7856-4a9b-a1db-02583339dc3e","uuid":"b25b4ba2-9168-45f3-b8dd-54c6bf226699"}

Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    52→\n    53→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    54→  ```ts\n    55→  await expect(async () => {\n    56→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    57→    const count = await cards.count();\n    58→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    59→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    60→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    61→    }\n    62→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    63→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    64→  ```\n    65→\n    66→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    67→  ```ts\n    68→  await expect(\n    69→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    70→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    71→  ```\n    72→\n    73→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    74→  calls that can block indefinitely.

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n    96→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n    97→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n    98→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n    99→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   100→  being unmodified.\n   101→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests.

Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3952cd7d-7856-4a9b-a1db-02583339dc3e","uuid":"edf17f7d-eaa0-47ea-9d4d-827987e8994c","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

Let me focus on the TasksListPage section (section 6). I need to:\n\n1. **CheckTestSpecTasksListPage**: Check testSpec.md directive violations in TasksListPage test entries\n2. **CheckComponentsTasksListPage**: Check writeApp.md directive violations in TasksListPage components\n3. **CheckTestsTasksListPage**: Check writeTests.md directive violations in TasksListPage tests\n\nLet me start with Job 1: checking the test entries in tests.md for the TasksListPage against testSpec.md directives.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n\n1. Ensure visual consistency across all page mockups, especially styling and navigation\n2. Inventory every visible element in each mockup—columns, filters, buttons, icons, badges, sections—and write a test for each\n3. Don't substitute simpler elements for what's actually shown in the mockup\n4. Every clickable element needs a test specifying its exact navigation target or action result\n5. For data mutations, verify persistence and side effects like history entries\n6. Test button and control appearance, not just their existence\n7. Modal dialogs must be tested for proper functionality\n8. Attachment features should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise\n9. Import and upload dialogs need to specify expected data formats\n10. Backend integrations require complete setup instructions visible in the UI\n11. State-changing actions need tests confirming cross-app updates\n\nNow I'm mapping out the TasksListPage test structure with its key components—the page header with title and action button, filter controls, task cards showing priority and metadata, and navigation—then creating specific test entries for each element like verifying the header displays correctly and the New Task button triggers the creation modal.\n\nContinuing through the test cases for task creation persistence, CSV import functionality with format specifications, filter operations across priority and assignee fields, and task card rendering with proper ordering and styling.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the remaining card interaction tests—navigating to detail pages, managing the action menu, marking tasks complete, editing with persistence, and deletion with confirmation prompts. I'm also checking for coverage gaps, particularly around navigation elements on this page, though that may already be addressed in other test sections. CLP-NAV-02) and cross-cutting tests. The testSpec says \"each page\" so this could be a gap.\n\n3. **Don't substitute easier elements**: Need to check against the mockup, but I don't have the mockup. I'll check the components.\n\n4. **Clickable element navigation**: TLP-CRD-04 specifies navigation to /tasks/:taskId. TLP-CRD-05/06/07/09 specify actions. Looks OK.\n\n5. **Mutation data persistence**: There's a potential gap here—TLP-HDR-03 tests task creation but doesn't explicitly mention whether a timeline entry gets created on the associated client. The ClientDetailPage tests do verify this behavior, but it's unclear if the Tasks list page creation flow also triggers that timeline entry.\n\n6. **Button appearance**: TLP-HDR-01 covers the New Task button styling and TLP-CRD-02 covers priority badge colors, so that seems fine.\n\n7. **Modal dialogs**: TLP-HDR-02 and TLP-CRD-07/08 cover the modal fields and editing, but I should verify there's a test for the cancel action.\n\n8. **Attachment**: Not directly applicable to the Tasks list page.\n\n9. **Import dialogs**: TLP-HDR-04 covers CSV format information.\n\n10. **Backend integrations**: Not applicable to the Tasks list page.\n\n11. **State-changing actions across the app**: TLP-CRD-06 confirms timeline entries are created on the associated client, and TLP-CRD-09 confirms deletion removes the task from both client and deal views. However, TLP-HDR-03 doesn't explicitly mention the timeline entry creation, which could be a gap.\n\nI should also check whether there's a test for the Export functionality—the SettingsPage has an

Let me also check the FilterSelect component to understand what's being used for filter dropdowns, and check whether native `<select>` elements are being used.\n\nLooking at the TasksFilterBar, it uses `FilterSelect` component (not native `<select>`). But the test file at line 231 uses `assigneeSelect.locator('option')` and `assigneeSelect.selectOption(assigneeValue!)` - these are patterns for native `<select>` elements. Let me check the FilterSelect component.\n\nAlso, the test TLP-FLT-04 at line 230 references `page.getByTestId('tasks-filter-assignee')` and uses `.locator('option')` and `.selectOption()` - this pattern suggests the test expects a native `<select>`, but the component uses `FilterSelect`. Let me check what `FilterSelect` renders.\n \nI'm noticing a disconnect here—the tests are using native `<select>` patterns like `.locator('option')` and `.selectOption()` for the assignee and client filters, but the actual component is using `FilterSelect`. The priority filter test might reveal whether this is a consistent issue across all filter tests.","signature":"EoUQCkYICxgCKkA3egrf8D4YvfZ5DPHmYQXtF2PtovC2Ns/KGE2c1lSk+uqks9MgPbNezLKeaSUysNxUK7lrOhO+JAF2KxykIIdQEgw3zcnc/aLW/itqwooaDNoB1UNHWKjzyDWn9SIwK8/Sb/n5I24t1AFHYaip4nC7awrzLkkkVk0qXo/VCaOzFKWJTM/7N0Fo5Frr4laaKuwOAgzWggQoCR0Rk3j1GfJnsoLcPZm1D8BF/gOXuIzjA4tQExNVG66jq2AJSenafU732vRRP3g7Vb9QD3D+/Y/5bh7o23HggQtTwOkvfPnZDxQjyLFRM/+Dvq7hX+l8MbEMlculAfZ3gehKjISD5qaUsFCkb5qDHu7rpKFERqJjpXlrC5Vr7Maipnd7s5kyAoY6O9OF8waZMYuJu32YDazbZxT/cmApkAqnp4x18vlU/Ctd5YbXaw6Yx9IdAamWpwAxuiMyl8ojnl94333v1GgaM2zqvOrB1aCkTd6TXU3ThiLQg0cNA4lAsXS4JpLLppXrqnEYFWX7dcqAuxVQie4yvmQlxnD9Elb4+D0NJtA6vRU+M05y51K6aST1kPWJIQulZDeP0Jv/qSQRmV7gdNBuYm/rDDmePQobVCe8Kr+KeMqAlbhly6WgJy0pUWtaOR78JuBkJdfaswxxpeWtNvscPMpkrAZTrL+5xeqg22Y8bYiP8Xm5nOCEE0Ft+luFzTO4CQtLRPy4jzGkk1nAyg/DrFflAvLJzJd+Qzmir7kcbvGRBunMCecxQoz2gOmCnebjRjv7dLIoOu+SUuYVVUg8I5RasBrNSrzugsoKWBcAf/SqvCzlOtrDOf2EZbiCVjIKXDjFfpjTzwPQw+1J4Ct+kYYjiVEqoMPgO5z7V557nwpMAkpEoHRbVkk3FC03K/SpaOC8L/pzpcw8QrCb8vX8HLghaK0O36mVmMuEjtaB458QwKJsy/cQLh165crLZh2nc4UihxYi6j3pwqvHokoLre5vFNohsN0yRhaQrFapRWj5uHa2ncWxwUpH6JPbSKp+a0i6jbEkY+CQa5qrwDGECtaCoSmMy7EwTWTXksfj2OuxMDpVEEcNfKh37d/8Yxd79IAbYTDAhI1WQ/PKhwqYUmdPdAIe9PG9PcyZG3gakrK/Q6zXvyjr2t8DmiymSZvKmpIlexTuGKOyjz+8TKlhyklTjMTB9pK4lctYid7ca0dypGSnyMjsKL7tOWeZlrtd4qDaK7Xr1Koo0P0UquXYssxViK91165W7npGtso3aSJOfGgKsbZIng5WE84gL1tT/bbENv2LPcYeQ4Op9xdbqZEiZfKxMqIzHuSEBlw8Smj7YesAUI5uu8yUP1VdFDQs232Otl7eoVbDpj847Dhm6xM8ZbzZ9NooA8axE2ijZy6l7Ii2OrffSafr5ebSjeHhGS9AGeP7jCHI4GnMPzXKPELlKKQRVhcfaSvuQNKEabsX/e4Wp32AcCY4sQk6HL6wtdQXeykx/XsYAbiagJwGvsyztpcgPNIL85YVfBiE1pfA0/vcD826GSjNxzgYuZHsgRZO3xHCG3kFPtZjl5r7cfU5AdqqsvDS3G5zUrBvx7d4PJHbTYy7uTTgbqbczeTNGbiK1LXFBY8RnhSz9ikyjKHQ9nxRid/HbwTbet7gOPf+mUVOez6i0HqD4m4wUNFBWs00XzqMQo8dE44u2y/PG3F8bEWONJHmxAKhBHxzEZZBFPIXULR/Q67Q9pE48skms6JcEVvbOzUjx/0JxinS5eDEUC1KTeUCtzMM6gEWOUUnag6Yv6/wksdh04HeszK2vT7+nnaGoBa0UvTT2TiKbbMwg/yVDcD7TSqYv/AxLaOjyaaoTN1l7P9jfNHWX8BSq2fa5xb1bp5OGuoIplgL/RNQqM8pC1DI5B7Etlp/bA9x8KqAkXTiSkM6A7PnD/BNNhJ3Z9b91RUbZzYW3cGopT9c0HLuTiuQSP3jJwIYBBaGTt/yV75I0LHcXA94j+I5bchN/9sRSOMo433u8chYEW7+ceB9X8zlpKh9cUDsTjLgPuGGNXx1TE6hGiT3FpFa1scNR0/RGncutUZ4/O0qD+J2/K9ykyb6FEuXkv115wPHgv4tA2FHmoaGWpqWcVKti+oDEd2Mod8gbBv0X7pnKIIaMs9mtUp5UCNxzLdFqQgUfOJWD7LdgXv2NI6qBYddoX9kEvunD23BPMPT3NkkajLb/LZrEXWzxQF6GBb+FMkrYdfs7QAIUBxiCNN0P7VVa6IabFhwaUrnF3gCjpc+hJ65/SWl72xwLTil9L8JqadloweLDyO0KVQGLGH5muC/YNCsQpeVCIG7TL2OU8xnM/sDnTVrLUxG5Pd1lEJISq/DDUlRHLRTP4WC/vjjRLRR1XC+IVmX+fQ67wP2M5O6X4ASWEvqSwZ/u6IfTX229Gx4NJdcoKkbVLESnBfRVOH9aYlQf08yMx1Y9rY358UfqeKNwGqVbJ0Ao9ZtXm+KFdinIH88tNW2TejQT7J1UMW0KuzvQiSudnr9L2d/9fs5h2PiMKOOZuQZJVhrkWQ+yTJonDO36OeMhlYIPqqsCC/Mm1JL3TqHIRAxe549g2GGn3zT/KB/aayNVTbS3DWx7iBtQtVlpjJm7uKkyIevwwFOV11oh/X4A6M3oEWbRWkpPBpNmI0Ih+LHwDCPFp4GBlecfzFaE7h3VVt9ZFLYnpUSGJX4+YaM88OmgANHCFf77vshRTY2FpbrW3KMzhgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11936,"cache_read_input_tokens":74096,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11936,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3952cd7d-7856-4a9b-a1db-02583339dc3e","uuid":"8f688f89-90fa-4fbd-aadf-a747cd5769e8"}

[2026-02-20T08:31:08.753Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_018BeeR11noh5VF2f7n7KBuZ","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Good. So `FilterSelect` is a custom dropdown component (NOT a native `<select>`). It renders buttons, not `<option>` elements.\n\nNow looking at the tests:\n\n**TLP-FLT-04** (line 230-246): Uses `page.getByTestId('tasks-filter-assignee')` then `.locator('option')` and `.selectOption()`. This is the pattern for a native `<select>`. But the actual component uses `FilterSelect`, which renders buttons and a custom dropdown. **This is a bug in the test** - it will find 0 `option` elements and the `if (options.length > 1)` check will be false, making the test a no-op.\n\n\n**TLP-FLT-05** (line 258-271): Same problem - it's trying to select from native `<option>` elements on the client filter, but `FilterSelect` doesn't render those at all.\n\nNow I need to systematically check all three jobs against the test directives.\n\nFor Job 1, I'm verifying the TasksListPage tests against testSpec.md. Navigation testing is already covered in the sidebar tests, so skipping that here is acceptable. The component inventory looks solid with good coverage across PageHeader, FilterBar, and TaskCards. The clickable elements are specifying their exact navigation targets, like TLP-CRD-04 pointing to `/tasks/:id`.\n\nNow I'm checking data mutations and persistence. TLP-HDR-03 covers task creation and verifies the task persists with correct priority, title, due date, and assignee, but it's missing verification that a timeline entry gets created on the associated client—that's a gap in the test specification.\n\nTLP-CRD-06 properly documents that marking complete creates a timeline entry, while TLP-CRD-08 for editing only mentions the change persists without specifying whether edits should trigger timeline entries, which might be intentional depending on the spec. TLP-CRD-09 correctly confirms deleted tasks disappear from both the client and deal.\n\nFor button and control appearance, the \"New Task\" button is described as blue/accent colored and the card layout shows all required elements like priority badge, title, due date, assignee, and menu button.\n\nLooking at modal dialog testing, I notice the create and edit task modals both have tests for opening and saving, but neither has a cancel button test documented, which seems like a gap given the spec requires complete modal testing. The import dialog is covered for both opening and actual import, and I'm checking what's documented for the delete confirmation dialog.\n\nFor state-changing actions, the create task test doesn't verify that the new task propagates to the associated client's task section or that a timeline entry gets created, which should happen when a task is created with a client association. I'm realizing the testSpec directive requires each mutation action to verify its own side effects—like timeline entry creation—rather than relying solely on cross-cutting tests to cover these. Looking at TLP-HDR-03 more carefully, it doesn't explicitly verify that a timeline entry is created when a task is added, which seems like a gap. But stepping back, the cross-cutting tests might already be handling these broader data persistence checks, so the violations here are probably minor.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the TasksListPage components against the writeApp.md directives, starting with verifying that interactive elements have the required data-testid attributes across the header, filter bar, and other interactive sections. I've verified comprehensive test ID coverage across all components, ensured all JSX is properly abstracted into React components with only minimal inline loading and empty states, and confirmed that custom FilterSelect components are used throughout instead of native HTML selects. Now I'm checking the tagged template literal syntax for internationalization...\n\nNot applicable to frontend components. Moving on to verify that searchable selects are implemented for modals that reference other entities like clients and deals, which they are. Duplicate navigation links aren't relevant here, and for layout composition, the page-level padding is appropriate while internal components use margins for spacing rather than outer padding that would conflict with parent layouts.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the priority badges and other status indicators are using Tailwind utilities or CSS variables as specified in the directive. The Tailwind approach isn't technically hardcoding rgba values, so it's not a clear violation of the directive, though centralizing domain-specific colors would align better with the spirit of it. Let me move past this minor concern and focus on the major issues. I'm checking the test entries now—the TaskCard does implement an assignee avatar with a User icon, which satisfies that requirement.\n\nLooking at the test file against the writeTests.md directives, I can see the navigation tests are verifying URLs precisely with regex patterns. The components appear to meet all the test entry requirements without significant violations of the code directives.\n\nHowever, there's a gap in the side effects verification—the test that marks a task complete and checks it disappears from the list doesn't actually verify that a timeline entry was created on the associated client, which the test description claims should happen. The test suite also relies on `getByTestId` appropriately, though there are some `getByText` calls within modal scopes that are reasonably scoped to avoid ambiguity.\n\nLooking at the file upload mechanics, the CSV import test correctly uses `setInputFiles` to handle actual file uploads. But I'm noticing a critical violation in one of the filter tests—it's using `.toPass()` with locator calls that have auto-wait built in, which directly contradicts the directive against doing this.\n\nThere's also a broken test for the assignee filter that's trying to interact with native `<select>` option elements, but the component actually uses a custom FilterSelect component, so those locators won't find anything and the test becomes a no-op. I've identified the key violations in the TasksListPage tests: TLP-FLT-02 has a deadlock issue with auto-waiting calls inside `.toPass()`, while TLP-FLT-04 and TLP-FLT-05 are testing against native select patterns when the component actually uses a custom FilterSelect, making those tests ineffective.\n\nNow I'm grouping these violations by fix priority and determining which ones need immediate attention versus which are lower-impact

Uses `page.textContent('body')` for verification — acceptable. ✓\n\n**TLP-HDR-04** (line 95-122): Uses `getByTestId` throughout. ✓\n\n**TLP-HDR-05** (line 124-156): Uses `setInputFiles` for file upload (directive: must use actual file upload). ✓\n\n**TLP-FLT-01** (line 160-169): Uses `getByTestId`. ✓\n\n**TLP-FLT-02** (line 171-191): **VIOLATION** — Uses `.toPass()` block with `await cards.count()` and `await highBadges.count()` inside (lines 183-190). The directive explicitly prohibits auto-waiting locator calls inside `.toPass()` blocks because they can deadlock. Should use atomic assertions like `.toHaveCount()` instead.\n\n**TLP-FLT-03** (line 193-219): Uses `isVisible().catch(() => false)` — acceptable pattern. ✓\n\n**TLP-FLT-04** (line 221-247): **VIOLATION** — Uses `assigneeSelect.locator('option').all()` (line 231) and `assigneeSelect.selectOption()` (line 237). These are native `<select>` patterns. But the component uses `FilterSelect` (custom dropdown with buttons, not `<option>` elements). **This test is a no-op** — `options.length` will always be 0, so the `if` block never executes.\n\n**TLP-FLT-05** (line 249-272): **VIOLATION** — Same issue as TLP-FLT-04. Uses `.locator('option').all()` and `.selectOption()` on a custom `FilterSelect` component. Test is a no-op.\n\n**TLP-FLT-06** (line 274-301): Properly uses `selectFilterOption` helper for FilterSelect. ✓\n\n**TLP-CRD-01** (line 305-334): Uses `getByTestId` throughout. ✓\n\n**TLP-CRD-02** (line 336-367): Uses `isVisible().catch(() => false)` — acceptable. ✓\n\n**TLP-CRD-03** (line 369-394): No auto-wait inside loops (iterates over already-retrieved text). ✓\n\n**TLP-CRD-04** (line 396-414): Verifies URL after click with `toHaveURL`. ✓\n\n**TLP-CRD-05** (line 416-442): Uses `getByTestId` for menu options. ✓\n\n**TLP-CRD-06** (line 444-465): Marks complete and verifies task disappears. Test entry says \"Timeline entry created on associated client\" but **test does not verify this**. However, this is also covered by cross-cutting ATOM tests, so this is a minor gap.\n\n**TLP-CRD-07** (line 467-496): Opens edit modal and verifies pre-filled data. ✓\n\n**TLP-CRD-08** (line 498-529): Edits and verifies persistence. ✓\n\n**TLP-CRD-09** (line 531-559): Deletes with confirmation. Uses `getByTestId('confirm-dialog')` and `getByTestId('confirm-ok')`. ✓\n\n### Violations found:\n\n1. **TLP-FLT-02** (line 183-190): Auto-waiting calls inside `.toPass()` — deadlock risk\n2. **TLP-FLT-04** (lines 230-237): Uses native `<select>` patterns on custom FilterSelect — test is a no-op\n3. **TLP-FLT-05** (lines 258-261): Same as TLP-FLT-04 — test is a no-op\n\nNow let me add fix groups for these violations."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":808,"cache_read_input_tokens":93803,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":808,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3952cd7d-7856-4a9b-a1db-02583339dc3e","uuid":"ac22cc85-55c1-45c2-8853-3a7766304b1f"}
