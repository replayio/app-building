button\n- **Then** the dialog closes\n- **And** the new client \"New Corp\" appears in the clients table with the correct Type, Status, Tags, and Source\n- **And** a success message is shown (e.g., \"Client created successfully\")\n\n#### Test: Add New Client dialog can be cancelled\n- **Given** the Add New Client dialog is open and the user has entered partial data\n- **When** the user clicks the Cancel button or closes the dialog\n- **Then** the dialog closes without creating a client\n- **And** no new client appears in the table\n\n### ClientsTable\n\n#### Test: Table displays all column headers\n- **Given** the Clients List Page is loaded\n- **Then** the table shows column headers: Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, Open Deals, Next Task\n- **And** each row has a \"...\" action menu on the right side\n\n#### Test: Client Name column displays client names as clickable links\n- **Given** the table shows clients\n- **Then** each client name is displayed as a clickable link\n- **When** the user clicks on a client name (e.g., \"Acme Corp\")\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for that client\n\n#### Test: Type column displays Organization or Individual\n- **Given** the table shows clients of both types\n- **Then** organization clients display \"Organization\" in the Type column\n- **And** individual clients display \"Individual\" in the Type column\n\n#### Test: Status column shows color-coded badges\n- **Given** the table shows clients with different statuses\n- **Then** \"Active\" status is shown as a green badge\n- **And** \"Inactive\" status is shown as a grey badge\n- **And** \"Prospect\" status is shown as a yellow/orange badge\n- **And** \"Churned\" status is shown as a red badge\n\n#### Test: Tags column displays multiple tags as chips\n- **Given** a client has multiple tags (e.g., \"SaaS\", \"Enterprise\", \"Q3-Target\")\n- **Then** all tags are displayed as individual chip/badge elements in the Tags column\n- **And** each tag is visually distinct and readable\n\n#### Test: Primary Contact column shows name and role\n- **Given** a client has a primary contact (e.g., \"Sarah Jenkins\" with role \"CEO\")\n- **Then** the Primary Contact column shows \"Sarah Jenkins (CEO)\"\n- **Given** an individual client where the person is the primary contact\n- **Then** the Primary Contact column shows the individual's name with \"(Self)\"\n\n#### Test: Open Deals column shows count and total value\n- **Given** a client has 3 open deals worth a total of $150k\n- **Then** the Open Deals column displays \"3 (Value: $150k)\"\n- **Given** a client has 0 open deals\n- **Then** the Open Deals column displays \"0\"\n\n#### Test: Next Task column shows upcoming task description and date\n- **Given** a client has an upcoming task (e.g., \"Follow-up call\" due \"Today, 2pm\")\n- **Then** the Next Task column displays \"Follow-up call - Today, 2pm\"\n- **Given** a client has no upcoming tasks\n- **Then** the Next Task column displays \"No task scheduled\" or \"N/A\"\n\n#### Test: Row action menu opens with options\n- **Given** the table shows clients\n- **When** the user clicks the \"...\" action menu on a client row\n- **Then** a dropdown menu appears with options such as \"View Details\", \"Edit\", \"Delete\"\n\n#### Test: Row action menu \"View Details\" navigates to client detail\n- **Given** the row action menu is open for client \"Acme Corp\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"View Details\"\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for \"Acme Corp\"\n\n#### Test: Row action menu \"Edit\" opens edit dialog\n- **Given** the row action menu is open for a client\n- **When** the user clicks \"Edit\"\n- **Then** an edit dialog opens pre-populated with the client's current data\n- **When** the user changes the client name and saves\n- **Then** the updated name is reflected in the clients table\n\n#### Test: Row action menu \"Delete\" with confirmation\n- **Given** the row action menu is open for client \"Globex Solutions\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"Delete\"\n- **Then** a confirmation dialog appears (e.g., \"Are you sure you want to delete Globex Solutions?\")\n- **When** the user confirms deletion\n- **Then** the client is removed from the table\n- **And** the pagination count updates accordingly\n- **When** the user cancels deletion\n- **Then** the client remains in the table\n\n#### Test: Table shows empty state when no clients exist\n- **Given** there are no clients in the system\n- **Then** the table

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input).

Let me start systematically working through each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientsListPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in ClientsListPage test entries\n\nI need to check all the ClientsListPage test entries in `docs/tests.md` (which is at `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`) against the directives in `testSpec.md`.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images of different pages - prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup - write test entry for each one\n\n\n3. Don't substitute easier-to-implement elements\n4. Every clickable element needs a test entry specifying exact navigation target or action result\n5. User actions that mutate data must verify the change persists and side effects occur exactly once\n6. Button and control appearance matters\n7. Modal dialogs need complete testing\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations need complete setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must test that other parts of the app update appropriately, including timeline, history, and symmetrical relationships\n\nI should also check if there's an AppSpec.md to understand what the application is supposed to do.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test entries for ClientsListPage against these directives. I have the test entries from the tests.md file covering lines 1-298 for the ClientsListPage section. Let me work through each directive systematically.\n\nFor the first directive about consistent navigation and styling, I can't directly verify images from the text spec, so no violation there. For the second directive about inventorying every visible element, I'm checking the Components section which includes the Sidebar Navigation with logo, nav links, and user profile avatar dropdown, the ClientsSearchAndFilters with search bar and various dropdowns, the ClientsActions with Import, Export, and Add New Client buttons, and the ClientsTable with its columns.\n\nLooking at the actual tests, they appear comprehensive—the Sidebar Navigation tests cover links with icons and routing, the ClientsSearchAndFilters tests cover search functionality and all filter combinations, the ClientsActions tests cover the import dialog with CSV processing, export with filtering, and the add new client flow, and the ClientsTable tests cover column headers, clickable names, status badges, tags chips, and other row elements.\n\nNow I'm verifying that every clickable element has a specific navigation target or action result. The sidebar nav links all point to exact routes, client names navigate to the detail page, and the import/export buttons trigger their respective dialogs and downloads. I need to finish checking the Add New Client flow and make sure all the remaining interactive elements are accounted for.\n\nThe row action menu items each have clear outcomes—View Details goes to the client detail page, Edit opens a dialog, and Delete shows a confirmation. Pagination controls are all specified. Everything checks out so far.\n\nFor data mutations, I'm verifying that the tests confirm persistence and side effects. Import CSV, Add New Client, Edit, and Delete all have tests that verify the changes appear in the table and trigger appropriate messages. But I'm noticing the ClientDetailPage has a TimelineSection that might need to be updated when clients are created, edited, or deleted from the main list.\n\nLooking at the testSpec directive about state-changing actions updating other parts of the app, I should check whether creating or editing a client generates timeline entries on the detail page. The current tests don't seem to verify this—they only check that the client appears in the table. The timeline tracks events like task creation and note additions, so client creation and edits should probably create entries there too. The visual elements all check out—icons, button styling, badges, and chips are properly tested. For the modals, the import dialog is missing a test for the cancel/close action without uploading, which could be a gap, while the Add New Client dialog covers the full flow including cancellation. The edit dialog from row actions appears to be cut off mid-check.\n\nLooking at the remaining directives, the import dialog properly documents the expected CSV format with required and optional columns, which covers the data format requirement. There's no backend integration on this page, so that's not applicable.\n\nFor the state-changing actions directive, the timeline on ClientDetailPage tracks specific events like task creation and note additions, but doesn't appear to include client creation from the list page itself. The delete action's pagination update is tested though. The directive asks whether every field that can change needs history tracking, which makes me reconsider whether client edits from the list should generate timeline entries—but since the timeline doesn't currently track those mutations, it's not a violation of what the app is designed to do.\n\nLooking at the actual test violations, the import dialog is missing a cancel test, and the edit dialog from the row action menu also lacks a test for closing without saving. Both of these fall under the directive about thoroughly testing modal dialogs. The pagination component lists ellipsis as a visible element, but there's no test verifying it appears when there are many pages—that's a potential gap under Directive 2. I should also verify the sidebar doesn't mention responsive or collapsing behavior that's untested, though the current tests seem to cover the main elements like logo, nav links, active states, and the user profile dropdown.\n\nFor the TestSpecClientsListPage violations, I'm seeing two clear gaps with modal dialogs: the Import dialog lacks a cancel/close test, and the Edit dialog doesn't test cancelling without saving—both violations of Directive 7's requirement to completely test modals. The pagination ellipsis is trickier to justify as a separate test since it's more of an implementation detail than a distinct user-facing feature.\n\nLooking at the state-changing actions more carefully, I'm questioning whether the directive really requires testing downstream effects like deal counts or associated records. The current tests verify the immediate table updates and pagination changes, which seems to satisfy the core requirement that \"other parts of the app update appropriately\" in the context of this list view. Testing backend cascades or detail page impacts would be beyond the scope of a list page test. I think these are OK for the list page context.\n\nLet me also check: the \"Add New Client form creates a client successfully\" test says the user \"adds tags 'SaaS' and 'Startup'\". But there's no test verifying that new tags typed by the user are actually created (if they don't already exist) vs selecting from existing tags. This might be a minor gap but I'm not sure it's a directive violation.\n\nActually, I want to re-examine Directive 5 more carefully: \"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur.\"\n\nThe Add New Client test verifies the new client appears in the table with correct fields and shows a success message. This covers persistence. Side effects: for a new client, there aren't many expected side effects beyond appearing in the table.\n\nThe Delete test verifies the client is removed and pagination updates, covering both persistence and side effects. The Edit test only verifies the name change, which satisfies the persistence requirement even though it doesn't test all editable fields—the directive doesn't mandate testing every possible change.\n\nFor Directive 4 on external flows, the Log Out action correctly specifies the result: the user is logged out and redirected to the login page.\n\nSo my actual violations are the missing cancel/close tests for the Import and Edit dialogs. I'm reconsidering whether the edit dialog test is actually incomplete. It only verifies changing the name field, but the create dialog tests all fields—Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source. The edit test should probably validate editing multiple fields, not just the name, to be consistent with the create dialog coverage.\n\nBut looking at the directives more carefully, they're about mockup elements and substitutions, not test comprehensiveness. The real violations I can pin down are the missing cancel/close button tests for both the Import and Edit dialogs.\n\nLet me shift focus to Jobs 2 and 3 now and locate the actual component files for

Identify test entries relevant to component, make sure entry requirements are satisfied\n2. Match visual appearance to mockup: button variants, icons, badge/tag styling, layouts, field sets\n3. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything E2E tests need\n4. Monorepo `base` in netlify.toml + `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n5. Neon tagged template literal syntax only\n6. DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID: convert empty strings to null with `value || null`\n\n\n7. Netlify Functions use path indexing with function name at index 2 and resource ID at index 3\n8. Modals referencing other entities should use searchable selects instead of plain text inputs for IDs\n9. Navigation links must be unique with no duplicates\n10. Filter controls and dropdowns should never use native `<select>` elements\n11. Attachments need file-type-specific icons or thumbnails, plus actual file upload functionality\n12. Every page requires consistent padding of `p-6 max-sm:p-3`, while components themselves should be layout-agnostic without outer padding\n13. Avoid using `overflow: hidden` on containers with absolutely positioned children; action menu wrappers need `position: relative` and `z-index` for proper layering\n\nNow I'm going through the components to verify they follow these directives. ClientsListPage has the correct padding and test IDs. Sidebar uses custom buttons for navigation instead of native selects and has all the necessary test IDs. ClientsSearchAndFilters uses a custom FilterDropdown component rather than native selects and is structured to be layout-agnostic.\n\nFor ClientsActions, the import dialog properly uses a file input with drag-and-drop support, and the buttons have the right icons. ClientsTable has test IDs throughout, uses CSS class mapping for status badges, and implements a custom dropdown for row actions. I need to verify the RowActionMenu has the correct overflow and z-index handling for the dropdown positioning.\n\nIn ClientFormModal, all form elements have test IDs, and it uses custom components like StatusDropdown and TypeSelector instead of native HTML elements. Now I'm checking what the Source field looks like—whether it's a dropdown or text input.\n\nThe Source field is implemented as a text input, which aligns with the spec's requirement of \"dropdown or text input.\" Now let me review the CSS to see if there are any

[2026-02-24T01:33:53.930Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_012Z6YPUXH8KCoV21NQKgLnB","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me systematically check each writeApp.md directive against the ClientsListPage components:\n\n**Directive 1: Identify test entries relevant to component, satisfy them**\nI'll check this holistically. The components seem to implement what the tests require.\n\n**Directive 2: Match visual appearance to mockup**\nCan't check against mockup images, but the styling seems comprehensive with proper badges, icons, and layouts.\n\n**Directive 3: All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items**\nLet me check each component:\n\n- ClientsListPage.tsx: `data-testid=\"clients-list-page\"` ✓\n\n\n- Sidebar.tsx: testids on sidebar, logo, nav, each link, profile button, avatar, dropdown, options ✓\n- ClientsSearchAndFilters.tsx: testids on wrapper, search input, clear button, each filter dropdown (trigger, menu, options) ✓\n- ClientsActions.tsx: testids on container, import/export/add buttons, import modal and its elements, cancel/confirm ✓\n- ClientsTable.tsx: testids on table, loading, empty state, each row, each cell (name, type, status, tags, contact, deals, task), action menu buttons, delete confirm modal ✓\n- Pagination.tsx: testids on container, info, prev/next buttons, page numbers, ellipsis ✓\n- ClientFormModal.tsx: testids on modal, content, close, form fields (name, type, status, tags, source), cancel, submit ✓\n\nThat covers the test IDs comprehensively. Now I need to verify the netlify.toml has the correct base directory set for the monorepo. I'm also checking that all database queries in clients.ts use the sql tagged template literal syntax consistently, which they do. For the empty string to null conversions on date and timestamp columns, I can see the source field is being handled properly in both the create and update handlers with appropriate null coalescing logic.\n\nThe import handler also correctly converts empty source values to null. The Netlify function is properly extracting the resource ID from the URL segments at index 3. The ClientsListPage modals don't need searchable selects since they're not referencing other entities. The sidebar navigation routes are all unique, and the form components are using custom dropdown components instead of native select elements.\n\nFor attachments, the import dialog handles actual file uploads with drag-and-drop support. The page itself has the required padding classes applied. Now I'm checking whether the component roots have the correct layout-agnostic structure without outer padding...\n\nClientsSearchAndFilters, ClientsActions, and ClientsTable all have clean root elements with no padding. But I'm noticing the Pagination component has a margin-top applied directly to it, which seems to violate the directive about keeping components layout-agnostic. The parent container should be controlling that spacing instead. I see these margin classes are defined in the shared CSS file, so while they technically violate the layout-agnostic principle, it's more of an organizational issue since everything's centralized and easily controlled. I'll flag it as a minor violation.\n\nNow checking the overflow directive—`.table-cell` has `overflow: hidden` but properly overrides it with `overflow: visible` for the action menu, which is correct. Moving on to `.app-layout` which also uses `overflow: hidden` with absolutely-positioned children...\n\nthe sidebar dropdown is positioned relative to `.sidebar-footer` rather than the layout itself, and it opens upward from the bottom. I need to verify whether the sidebar's own `overflow-y: auto` would clip the dropdown when it extends above the footer. the sidebar has `overflow-y: auto` and the dropdown opens upward from the footer, so it could get clipped if it extends beyond the visible area. But since the sidebar is full-height and there are only 6 nav items, the dropdown should stay within bounds. The `.app-layout` with `overflow: hidden` is the real concern—it could clip absolutely-positioned elements that extend beyond its container, though the sidebar dropdown should be contained within the sidebar itself.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The directive specifically warns against `overflow: hidden` on containers with absolutely-positioned children, and `.app-layout` does have children (sidebar and app-main) that contain absolutely-positioned elements like dropdowns. But since those absolutely-positioned elements are nested within their own containers rather than direct children of `.app-layout`, it might not technically violate the directive.\n\nLooking at the table styling, the `.table-cell` has `overflow: hidden` but the action cell properly oversets it to `overflow: visible`, which is the right approach. The `.table-cell-tags` class also has `overflow: hidden` which is fine since tags don't need absolutely-positioned children. The `.clients-table` container itself doesn't have `overflow: hidden`, so the table structure looks solid overall.\n\nNow I'm checking the actual violations against the directive. The Pagination and ClientsSearchAndFilters components both have outer margins on their root elements, which violates the layout-agnostic principle. But I need to reconsider whether these are actually worth flagging—the directive says components shouldn't include outer spacing, but I should verify if these margins are truly problematic or if they're acceptable in context.\n\nLooking at how ClientsListPage uses these components, the spacing is currently handled by the components themselves rather than the parent layout. Removing these margins would require refactoring the page to manage spacing instead. This feels like a valid but lower-priority issue to flag.\n\nNow I'm examining the `.app-layout` overflow property and how it interacts with descendant dropdown and action menus. I'm realizing I need to distinguish between the writeApp.md and testSpec.md directives—the comment requirement is from testSpec.md, not writeApp.md. Let me focus on what writeApp.md actually requires: ensuring the app code satisfies the test entry requirements from testSpec. I should check whether testSpec mentions JSX comments as a requirement for the app code itself. The testSpec clearly requires JSX comments next to every interactive element listing the test titles that exercise it, and since writeApp is supposed to implement what testSpec requires, this missing requirement counts as a violation in both places. Adding these comments across all components would be a substantial undertaking, so I should flag this as an issue.\n\nNow I'm working through which job should catch this violation—the testSpec directive about JSX comments is really a cross-cutting requirement that applies during component development, so it belongs in the writeApp check even though it originates from testSpec.\n\nmd. For Job 2, I'm systematically going through the writeApp directives to see which ones apply and which ones are satisfied, checking things like data-testid attributes, Neon syntax, null conversions, and path indexing.\n\nI've found a couple of issues: the pagination and filters components aren't layout-agnostic since they have outer padding, and there's a minor overflow:hidden risk with the app layout container that could clip absolutely-positioned children. Now I need to verify the netlify.toml configuration for the monorepo base

The main issue I'm seeing is those component margins breaking the layout-agnostic pattern, though I should double-check whether these are actually violations or if there's context I'm missing.\n\nActually, thinking about this more carefully—even though the margins are defined in a shared CSS file rather than inline in the component, the component's root element still ends up with margin applied to it. That violates the directive regardless of where the CSS lives. The parent page should be controlling spacing, not the component itself. I'll count this as a violation.\n\nI also need to check the `testSpec.md` requirements about comments next to interactive elements.  This is a testSpec directive, not a writeApp one, so it's technically outside my Job 2 scope of checking components against writeApp directives. But since it's about code that should exist in the components, I should flag it as a testSpec violation that I missed during Job 1.","signature":"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

Also assert side effect happens exactly once.**4. \n\nI should also avoid using `getByText()` with common words since that's unreliable — `getByTestId` or `getByRole` are better choices, and I need to make sure all `data-testid` values stay consistent across test files. File upload tests need to actually exercise Playwright's file upload mechanics, and I should never put locator calls with auto-wait inside `.toPass()` blocks. Strategy files belong in `/repo/strategies/jobs/`, not the app directory, and tests must cover the exact fields described in the spec. Auth flow tests would run against a real backend, though that's not applicable for this client-side work.\n\nNow I'm going through the test files one by one. For the sidebar tests, I'm checking that the first test properly validates all six navigation links are visible with their correct SVG icons, and that the Clients link shows as active along with the profile button and avatar. The second test is starting to verify that clicking each navigation link routes to the correct page — I can see it's checking Dashboard routes to `/dashboard` and appears to be continuing through the other links. Logs out successfully and redirects to login ✓. Now moving into the search and filters tests—I'm verifying that the search bar correctly filters clients by name, tag, and contact name using specific data-testid selectors to ensure only matching results display.\n\nThe empty state test confirms that searching for a non-existent value shows the empty state with \"0 of 0 clients\" pagination. For the status dropdown, I'm checking that selecting \"Active\" filters the results and displays the correct status badge text, then verifying all visible badges match the selected status before resetting back to \"All\". The test iterates through the status badges...\n\nChecking status badges across results...\n\nThe tags and source dropdowns follow similar filtering patterns. For sorting, I'm verifying that the Name A-Z and Name Z-A options actually reorder the table correctly, though using `allTextContents()` could be fragile if the DOM shifts during the check.\n\nThe multiple filters test applies Status, Tags, and search together and confirms all visible rows satisfy every condition. The clearing test uses relative assertions comparing counts before and after, which aligns with the parallel test design approach.\n\nNow I'm moving into the actions spec file and checking the import button test—it clicks the button and verifies the modal appears.\n\nContinuing through the import tests: the valid CSV test creates a file on disk, uploads it via the file input, previews the data with a count check, confirms the import, and then verifies the success message, modal closure, and the new client appearing in the table. The invalid file test uploads a CSV missing a required column and confirms the error message displays while the import button stays hidden. The export button test is starting... all fields including name, type, status, tags, and source ✓\n- Submits the form and confirms the dialog closes ✓\n- Verifies the new client appears in the table ✓\n\nBut I'm noticing the test doesn't actually check for the success message that the spec mentions—\"Client created successfully\". Looking at the component code, `ClientFormModal` just closes without showing any toast notification, and `handleCreate` only refetches the data. So there's a gap between what the spec says should happen and what the app actually does.\n\nFor the cancel test, it's straightforward—partial data entry, clicking cancel, and verifying both the modal closes and no new client gets added.\n\nNow looking at the table tests, the header verification checks all seven column headers and the action menu button, but it's using CSS class selectors instead of test IDs. The directive prefers `getByTestId`, but these header cells don't have test IDs in the app, so the test is working with what's available. This is really an app implementation gap rather than a test issue.\n\nThe client name column test extracts the client ID from the test ID and verifies the navigation works correctly. The type column test validates that cells contain either Organization or Individual values, limited to the first ten rows to keep things performant. The status column checks that the color-coded badge classes are applied correctly, also limited to ten rows. For the tags column, it searches for a specific client and verifies that tag chips are displayed with a count of at least two.\n\nNow checking the primary contact column to ensure it displays the contact name and role correctly, with fallback handling for cases where the role might not be visible. The open deals column test verifies both the deal count and total value are shown, including a zero count scenario. The next task column confirms that upcoming task descriptions and dates appear, along with a \"No task scheduled\" message when applicable. Finally, the row action menu test opens the menu and validates that View Details, Edit, and Delete options are all present.\n\nFor the View Details action, I'm verifying that clicking it navigates to the client detail page by checking the URL. The Edit action test opens the edit dialog, confirms the client name is pre-populated, changes it, saves the changes, and then verifies the updated name appears in the table. However, I'm noticing the spec mentions changing both the client name and something else, but the test only covers the name change. I need to reconsider whether this fully satisfies the directive that requires testing all described interactions.\n\nFor the Delete action, I'm creating a unique client to avoid test data dependencies, then testing both the cancel and confirm paths of the deletion confirmation dialog. But looking back at the spec, it says the pagination count should update after deletion, and the test doesn't verify that assertion.\n\nFor the empty state test, the spec mentions \"no clients in the system\" but the test uses search filtering to achieve empty results instead, which is a practical approach for parallel test execution.\n\nNow checking the pagination tests—the first one verifies the count display format, and the second one is setting up clients as needed before testing the Next page functionality.\n\nThe Next page test confirms the pagination text updates when navigating, and the Previous button becomes enabled on page 2, though it only checks that the text changed rather than verifying the exact range of clients displayed. The Previous page test then navigates back and confirms the text reflects the first page range.\n\nNow I'm checking the remaining pagination tests—verifying the Next button disables on the last page, that clicking specific page numbers navigates correctly, and that the current page is visually highlighted. I'm also looking at the pagination reset behavior when filters are applied, which should return users to page 1. I'm examining the `.toPass()` directive in the test file to see how auto-wait calls are being handled within the expect blocks.\n\nI found a violation in the pagination test around line 185—it's using `textContent()` inside a `.toPass()` retry block, which breaks the directive against putting Playwright auto-wait methods inside retry blocks. The test should use a more atomic assertion like `toContainText()` instead, though matching multiple patterns like \"Showing 1-\" or \"Showing 0 of 0\" requires a different approach.\n\nI'm also noticing the \"Next button is disabled on last page\" test uses `isDisabled()` in a while loop, which technically isn't inside `.toPass()` but could still be problematic since the loop might run indefinitely if the button never becomes disabled, and `waitForTimeout()` is discouraged anyway.\n\nFor Directive 4, I'm checking uses of `getByText()` with common words—the specific company names like \"Acme Corp\" and \"Globex Solutions\" are fine, and while \"Type\" is generic, it's scoped within the table header so it's not a major issue.\n\nActually, I realize the tests are using `.filter({ hasText })` with CSS selectors, not `getByText()` directly, so this doesn't violate the directive at all. Let me scan through all the test files to confirm none of them actually use `getByText()`—checking sidebar, search-and-filters, actions, table, and pagination specs, and none of them do.\n\nNow I'm verifying the consistent testid naming across all files—the patterns like `client-row-`, `client-name-`, `client-status-` are used uniformly, and the sidebar and pagination testids follow the same convention. For parallel test design, I'm seeing that tests use timestamped unique names to avoid conflicts, though the import test's hardcoded names could potentially clash if tests run simultaneously with the same seed.\n\nThe `.first()` usage I'm seeing isn't actually a workaround for ambiguity—it's intentional selection of the first row when the test needs to interact with any client, which is appropriate. Now I'm looking more closely at the \"Pagination resets when filters change\" test to understand the `.toPass()` implementation...\n\nExamining the async expectation...\n\nThe issue is that calling `.textContent()` directly inside the async block can cause staleness or hanging if the DOM is updating. Instead, I should use a matcher like `toHaveText()` or `toContainText()` that handles the waiting and retrying automatically, which would be cleaner and more reliable.\n\nLooking at the test violations in the codebase, there's the pagination assertion issue in pagination.spec.ts that uses `.textContent()` inside `.toPass()`, which breaks the directive. There's also the delete test in table.spec.ts that claims to verify pagination count updates but doesn't actually assert it—the test spec says it should check this, so I need to add that assertion to match what's documented. I'm consolidating my findings across all three test jobs to see the full picture of what needs to be
