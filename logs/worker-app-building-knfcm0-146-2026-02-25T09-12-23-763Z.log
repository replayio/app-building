This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"20dd06ca-9916-4e95-99e2-6242a9e6f0be","uuid":"1612c8a1-0142-4c09-8eb4-f4b016f00198","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links.

FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match.

Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"20dd06ca-9916-4e95-99e2-6242a9e6f0be","uuid":"39af79ad-3005-4872-b57b-030debdda3ee","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

Let me now look at the existing reference implementations - specifically to see how other apps do detail pages, and understand the backend pattern for detail endpoints. I need to:\n\n1. Create backend API endpoints for client detail data (tasks, deals, attachments, people, timeline, update client)\n2. Create a Redux slice for the client detail page\n3. Create all the components\n4. Wire everything together in the page\n\nLet me look at how other apps handle this. Let me check SupplierTracker's SupplierDetailsPage since it's likely a good reference.\n\nActually, I have enough context now. Let me plan out the work:\n\n\nI need to build out several backend endpoints - the clients endpoint already handles fetching a single client, but I'm missing the update endpoint and all the related resource endpoints for tasks, deals, and attachments tied to that client, plus the ability to create and delete those resources.\n\nLooking at the existing codebase, there are only auth and clients functions, so I'll need to create new backend functions. I could either build a single enriched endpoint that returns all client data together, or create separate endpoints for each resource type. Given the task focus, I should concentrate on building the ClientHeader and QuickActions components first rather than getting bogged down in backend architecture decisions right now. I'm realizing I should check what endpoints already exist in the codebase before creating duplicates. Since only `auth.ts` and `clients.ts` are currently there, I'll need to create the rest, but I can consolidate some of them—like combining follow functionality into the clients endpoint rather than a separate file. I need to map out the implementation order more carefully—starting with the backend endpoints and Redux slice, then tackling components. Before I dive into coding, I should verify how UploadThing is configured since file uploads are part of the

Now let me plan my work and start building.\n\nI need to install `uploadthing` as a dependency in the SalesCRM package.json.\n\nLet me now plan the complete implementation:\n\n### Backend endpoints needed:\n1. **Extend `clients.ts`** - Add PUT for updating client details\n2. **`tasks.ts`** - GET by client, POST create, PUT update status (complete)\n3. **`deals.ts`** - GET by client, POST create\n4. **`attachments.ts`** - GET by client, POST create (file upload + link), DELETE\n\n\n5. **`individuals.ts`** - GET by client, POST create+associate\n6. **`timeline.ts`** - GET by client, POST create\n7. **`client-follow.ts`** - GET check, POST toggle\n8. **`users.ts`** - GET list\n\nI also need to create a Redux slice for managing the client detail state with all the necessary async thunks, and build out the UI components including the client header with badges, quick action buttons, and source information section.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the remaining components—task, deal, attachment, and people sections with their respective modals, plus a timeline feed and follow button. Let me start implementing the backend infrastructure first, beginning with the necessary dependencies.\n\nI'll work through this systematically: setting up the backend endpoints for all the features, creating the Redux slice to manage the client detail state, then building out each component piece by piece.","signature":"EtsTCkYICxgCKkDLiBjKt4CWdqJfI2GKeIBqWcvMHFq2E9uesCaTkhcjd9lj+iCTCc2ClfUSDEO/2RJ5gZab5jO0di59sng1S5qyEgw4Lxt0a91YQRAt9RoaDLnDm6ymnfALwJV9TyIw62OpV2636+6yqa32Vna3V9mO2qeHYSjj2aIw1PPHVRXOis5XMz50fmXC0i8KB6HUKsISknkiDdjpxmQwC+uGqxYiNDRUXVtvcuGaNSK2D2mhW82St2ipxA+yfmYvrd1q/9JrFQob+deExZf28co4RtCy1W0nV/JchZpv1CdN7xbKxRDGXXqiAYvWuIoQ+1GC2uCK3hiCJ8Zy1BbhjoY8gBWMAigPZYMIE4SLz+W6gQVggCT+ATqwzUiVtGdHlfsvWGM1mO3++sJ9B0iUCaC4rdBfOesyofcwNduu3OgqMABeDFfRgtTWoj2Ir6Lv6UnzQ2vE/6HSHvfOJcJvK7vYjyJLoPE/zYRekFDvCl/swe1EBkWb/xlKbWTx7zEaETLCCHysreeoPZFLLGA9X+hVJTvxGlO6zdutfzzN6atqtNgso1RXaIkEKhrdUs+952s/XT0hSY6fFmUj8njUlrAUPbMM2IRgo3/O+y6/UlZzkVrF/4z5BokgKc/YI4uKZZilTjIcG7iMmMjxEdPWh82VYX6vOynMxJAmgKXyJG4mr+7vVwLZzrIhfGUqKjR6vLYuU8KzGf/tiaeafvx+JHq7J2EsKQzWBwF0q5nZHLpslyzzF9bVt88O+BHYdgSBojJZL+yVGt0SvCa0sb5tV2himCinYn1UgxSyxfnoBCY+E4YdGHYU+crJOjNzGW37cgF97ozFaUYg286Ot+ZkymVDguitWsLBg4zNSis5cAyRke3Vf+mWGcu03k7UcT5TmJmouz2YyY9vtOoqWjcNBfLYep/obk6wHy2yRoqYsPxI0hQg0EYE67CYpTRWmVtg/bTIRlDt5cF1o2JFlP2+iCqZe4Wn+H1+VTBiyqRkyuns+GIL7zzLmTkaz+xaSsZ/swHcvje/zheLm6C+ZJWzRneQd/kcFniepHALzI5osPlvjGJct1DR0NDNAUOijZXqzco+1uj1h8iiBLApwY/B7I1GBdwQhbhMpJ9JUGaDBaWRHwIJWjkK0yLioaKHoJzEPSlo5yFjhYFxm3qC5EeNIWh+huNW7UKpL7724etiNFzir70wNFRNIa6OGL1+8YgedtRJVwFB/0EDSfeChjvnOYyupudAEd65IQDGbQj4bY+t4509avFg6P+YrRprJV7/ZzPQu7t77gyF5JF3iVbnN4dveG0l12mVdIbDQmQI9uSSvUBNk9atEfSI14+vWNUDCHwT0rJjlSBPb7OQ4z5fsvuMFnhHJI+TPIl/tAfvdsDna8BH0O/fakoGZEWVJh3W9iXLoHyuZt0rIpNJn8WXgPQgRXUNkJ7zWWDhrW7hbCGvX/jhIDveX8gfhSIxJFVHU57gKsMLDqlgZscoRkkhNOKtmag15ZtexJuS4n4009bRS6l1RYpBPcm69MYhwlRjFpua0QdwZSaU6QFM7sCdZPwiIq0fTvbIfoJ0KbyjdoNOglRDrpod7Z68qfCIyEmH8ptm+ejPjOE6UjuDqJvuRbT+HojALxg1tXH0URxG2IyBt+9PTdWsJ1LJLVCEPiyAMwXvK3AxL+3rrXk75YxPiHVLRxp0Pz8rF22SpnFtpwGH67b1gpv0ADm4dIlx/ggi8akp4GyvqEvJ8VKN5uWxgT3A6o9e+MnY8T4AsC2V9IrD1a9j0Mx7eyyD6vu4Tsv+389fW3mC1m7XW0wfFmGpAHDztBCAMPtnPejBo+8B7vegFpBWp/FIDC+HCMmjsPevWwIDvpgw2nuFAh6vmgZnspQVpIPVFg7GoJSYSGRbrkREEiboyQBD7kbuM5L/qUuSIipqOdl8wuFuSTZu/8cBrwh7WHYb9/SOKTWWhNvm6xvkZ6KfJXTKhnsLDr9XHUY7EYuj9aTAQO1L12AvnIUMdMHnEdRuFTmqUAWib5MThhoRcJuzJiIIDrMFrGLhif/bF38jNHjPhNjh2+QQOyZ6CICWr1hMCQbLPW6zj8RMrxq1kLDIuPtyg0xb57ej3cgR71er2VQkEvbnQCqCjvIDGEyGEd3ac0DCGuxwm3VvkUKEJ+w8PkyOzdip2o73kwgi+axG9Pr6GsYNs5ZV2kwqTdPjtHG8Fi9bk0k0ca2SAOhWeyRbLPbu2LsOQnPQDD7DS/ZtVUwwT8orBYJB68p98bPLJAB5IqpIfxIrnV8bXMOPnnT6Wv6ElBhkanWCD4R2bQw6No5MTzjDjZIJUMwFniNgVkMl6ysyD/xv9YhigM1aBnk9tPvR+f1iFpru0M64D7potI6nWk5T5u1sB6okJ8O9ZV96ANzeI/emJBuozNw+lNNamJWCope9hPux3Kokqw/JPI4akmExzKUPA/uqfGQEGbpWXl/K5SqRNfR4MyfdXrBHlTZXB4uMmxmK7p/e9PtArZP+nUZIAfdiEQUMIwFJU8qxKuA03lODSzrFXY5toe9uqlP6K7mgRFwNMF3H2fWiy599m5YdCVHfFpqCho/PFc7powQ8hGFM5WFL507ua0eGmAZMI1gVXe0tjzUUCh8464zrp8tBGBs91vbQv+tzupyEcXugAI61G9H8uXIGS3ImOSTo9Xd0w5am4B5PqlwjTiDSiByI6jAeZr4emadE7Oh7eumafkJMCSX3wvH3ib6QO8nIMXJYk5sxBHN3XHckE9oXAxpwhLg/rrw+JQOIPxE/aIMTOdawBqH+Cfj4BZYAOUuApZmCDlWf50j9pz4ZENikJIeypsJ3QqHvDHtsZx0GngIzBSWBftKPoKaeWWsOOPIt99yZBM3Ie8hUxaqvjWTZEERnm5CL9t6GtzX3PADICb/mp9nf2iuEh+92ypPO6BKXlIHz/JZ3USY4/AAGDtVxKOJ/iX8qcid5qo5aiXdyuSKjEo9wQUNEICY97idawwOI36xD8VKeTOnUjEsHCD9vOr8QQNuqFUOpT+PdIe7cWMn0MJyFg7ZeB2QXjY4De2lNAvLfOWa81vo/R4eoi6oQMOtsM4py1XSVLTYTfubomeLdRhHQ4YU8oieE0rZAZ4RWrNK9tYhVqMRliDivi2iU0KrN/WbKF+FTzM5/U0+FuxM56uWCrlT54b8xnZNMNp0Dp3Z95zljnw9uXqEoo6DqcwTmKaU7B4M+iECCjn88nzMQHLUMht7XwzZwBbmXn7SPP85T+8jNqjWUQHnBJ5ULXWm2tGI4RqxPl5izDWDnpE80hbqdFiMF5KB8Xz6Qo8PArC0EjRT3vBbunCRp5AXUNTJz5EIf4SCij5Odu605bpI+GAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1693,"cache_read_input_tokens":91151,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1693,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"20dd06ca-9916-4e95-99e2-6242a9e6f0be","uuid":"23930ec3-7d54-486e-9e8a-c9c7abe1fc8a"}
