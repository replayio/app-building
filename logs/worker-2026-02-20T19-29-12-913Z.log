This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n    16→- Before: 6d387c9\n    17→- After: (this commit)\n    18→- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n    19→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n    20→- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n    21→\n    22→2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    23→- Before: e4b5f26\n    24→- After: (this commit)\n    25→- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n    26→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n    27→\n    28→2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    29→- Before: 837fc7f\n    30→- After: 366203c\n    31→- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n    32→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n    33→\n    34→2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n    35→- Before: edc5279\n    36→- After: (this commit)\n    37→- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n    38→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n    39→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n    40→\n    41→2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n    42→- Before: 1e5a771\n    43→- After: (this commit)\n    44→- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    45→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n    46→\n    47→2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n    48→- Before: 1e5a771\n    49→- After: (this commit)\n    50→- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    51→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n    52→\n    53→2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n    54→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    55→- After: (this commit)\n    56→- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    57→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    58→\n    59→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    60→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    61→- After: (this commit)\n    62→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    63→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    64→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    65→\n    66→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    67→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    68→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    69→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    70→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    71→\n    72→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    73→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    74→\n    75→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    76→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    77→\n    78→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    79→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    80→\n    81→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    82→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    83→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    84→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    85→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    86→\n    87→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    88→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    89→- Before: df7222c\n    90→- After: c0847d0\n    91→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    92→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n    93→\n    94→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n    95→- Before: ef67c9a\n    96→- After: (this commit)\n    97→- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n    98→- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n    99→- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n   100→\n   101→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n   102→- Before: 4e63501\n   103→- After: (this commit)\n   104→- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n   105→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n   106→\n   107→2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n   108→- Before: fbafcda\n   109→- After: (this commit)\n   110→- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n   111→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n   112→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n   113→\n   114→\n   115→\n   116→2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n   117→- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n   118→- Before: fc47dd2\n   119→- After: 8b82e35\n   120→- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n   121→- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n   122→\n   123→2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n   124→- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n   125→- Before: 78daa0a\n   126→- After: fc47dd2\n   127→- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n   128→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n   129→- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n   130→\n   131→2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n   132→- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n   133→- Before: 78daa0a\n   134→- After: fc47dd2\n   135→- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n   136→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n   137→- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n   138→\n   139→2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n   140→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n   141→- Before: 78daa0a\n   142→- After: fc47dd2\n   143→- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n   144→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n   145→- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n   146→\n   147→2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n   148→- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n   149→- Before: 0cd095c\n   150→- After: 78daa0a\n   151→- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior. Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n   152→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n   153→- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n   154→\n   155→2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n   156→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n   157→- Before: 0301f38\n   158→- After: 0cd095c\n   159→- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n   160→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n   161→- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n   162→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_016rTx5qp7sifa6RB37Vdhp5","session_id":"69bee6e2-1718-4474-922c-3858056f4594","uuid":"54d2e570-f976-46db-94c9-93f0b1268235"}

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence.

This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n    16→- Before: 6d387c9\n    17→- After: (this commit)\n    18→- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n    19→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n    20→- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n    21→\n    22→2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    23→- Before: e4b5f26\n    24→- After: (this commit)\n    25→- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n    26→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n    27→\n    28→2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    29→- Before: 837fc7f\n    30→- After: 366203c\n    31→- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n    32→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n    33→\n    34→2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n    35→- Before: edc5279\n    36→- After: (this commit)\n    37→- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n    38→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n    39→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n    40→\n    41→2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n    42→- Before: 1e5a771\n    43→- After: (this commit)\n    44→- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    45→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n    46→\n    47→2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n    48→- Before: 1e5a771\n    49→- After: (this commit)\n    50→- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    51→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n    52→\n    53→2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n    54→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    55→- After: (this commit)\n    56→- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    57→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    58→\n    59→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    60→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    61→- After: (this commit)\n    62→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    63→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    64→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    65→\n    66→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    67→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    68→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    69→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    70→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    71→\n    72→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    73→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    74→\n    75→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    76→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    77→\n    78→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    79→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    80→\n    81→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    82→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    83→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    84→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    85→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    86→\n    87→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    88→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    89→- Before: df7222c\n    90→- After: c0847d0\n    91→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright.

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n\n## Finished\n\n2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: e4b5f26\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n\n2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: 837fc7f\n- After: 366203c\n- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n\n2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n- Before: edc5279\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation.
