Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"858002b9-b6f5-432f-a8ba-9a6c988c24b2","uuid":"9b2cd6d5-2aa7-4c23-b9ee-29afdb2c1c29","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports. Budget information is visible or accessible for each account, including an overall budget for the account and budgets for specific items (for example, big or notable expenses), potentially displayed as inline indicators or links to more detailed budget views.\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdjq4Pw1UektSnylW57BEZobPcKpDY4LHifIMz\n     9→\n    10→2.

The layout consists of the account name and category (asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense) at the top, followed by a transaction list or ledger. Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n    15→   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01E6CmqegNNbSDSmoQuTzA6d","session_id":"858002b9-b6f5-432f-a8ba-9a6c988c24b2","uuid":"3f075bcc-9b3a-4f73-9857-77879a33ed45"}

Directory Structure\n\n```\n/repo/apps/Accounting/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/          # All React components\n│   ├── pages/               # Page components (AccountsPage, ReportListPage, etc.)\n│   ├── slices/              # Redux slices (accounts, transactions, reports, budgets)\n│   ├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions\n│   ├── App.tsx              # Main app component with routing\n│   ├── store.ts             # Redux store setup\n│   ├── hooks.ts             # Custom hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector)\n│   ├── index.css            # All app styling\n│   └── main.tsx             # Entry point\n├── netlify/functions/       # Serverless functions (accounts, transactions, reports)\n├── tests/                   # Playwright E2E tests\n├── docs/                    # Documentation (tests.md, bugs/)\n├── AppSpec.md              # Feature specifications\n├── netlify.toml            # Netlify deployment config\n├── playwright.config.ts    # Test configuration\n└── package.json            # Dependencies\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Types & Data Models\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/types/index.ts`\n\n```typescript\n// Main domain types\nAccount         // id, name, code, category, balance, budget fields\nTransaction     // id, date, description, currency, entries, tags\nTransactionEntry // debit/credit entries for a transaction\nBudget          // account-specific budgets with actual vs planned\nReport          // report metadata: type, date_range, filters\nReportItem      // line items in a report with variance calculations\n\n// Account categories: \"assets\" | \"liabilities\" | \"equity\" | \"revenue\" | \"expenses\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Redux Store Setup\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/store.ts`\n\n- Store combines 5 reducers:\n  - `auth` (shared auth reducer)\n  - `accounts` - fetches/manages accounts\n  - `transactions` - manages transaction entries\n  - `reports` - manages report list and details\n  - `budgets` - manages budget data\n\n**Custom Hooks** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/hooks.ts`):\n- `useAppDispatch()` - typed dispatch\n- `useAppSelector()` - typed selector with RootState\n\n---\n\n## 4. Report System Components\n\n### 4.1 ReportTypeSelector\n**File**: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/ReportTypeSelector.tsx`\n\n```typescript\ninterface ReportTypeSelectorProps {\n  value: \"summary\" | \"detailed\" | \"budget_vs_actual\"\n  onChange: (type) => void\n}\n\n// Renders 3 tab buttons with icons for each report type\n// Uses CSS Grid (1fr 1fr 1fr)\n// Active state: .report-type-tab--active (green border + background)\n```\n\n**CSS Classes**:\n- `.report-type-tabs` - grid container\n- `.report-type-tab` - individual tab button\n- `.report-type-tab--active` - active state\n- `.report-type-tab-label` - text label inside tab\n\n---\n\n### 4.2 DateRangeSelector\n**File**: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/DateRangeSelector.tsx`\n\n```typescript\ninterface DateRangeSelectorProps {\n  startDate: string\n  endDate: string\n  onStartDateChange: (date) => void\n  onEndDateChange: (date) => void\n}\n\n// Two date inputs + 3 preset buttons (This Month, Last Quarter, YTD)\n// Date formatting: YYYY-MM-DD ISO format\n// Helper functions: getThisMonthRange(), getLastQuarterRange(), getYTDRange()\n```\n\n**CSS Classes**:\n- `.date-range-row` - grid with 2 columns\n- `.date-range-field` - relative container for date input + icon\n- `.date-range-presets` - flex container for preset buttons\n- `.date-range-preset-btn` - individual preset button\n\n---\n\n### 4.3 AccountCategoryFilter\n**File**: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/AccountCategoryFilter.tsx`\n\n```typescript\ninterface AccountCategoryFilterProps {\n  subCategoryState: Record<string, boolean>  // checkbox states\n  onSubCategoryChange: (newState) => void\n  includeZeroBalance: boolean\n  onIncludeZeroBalanceChange: (value) => void\n}\n\n// Hierarchical category tree: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Expenses\n// Each has 2-3 subcategories (Current Assets, Fixed Assets, etc.)\n// Indeterminate checkbox state for \"select all\" behavior\n// Toggle switch for \"Include Zero Balance Accounts\"\n```\n\n**Category Tree** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/categoryTree.ts`):\n```typescript\nCATEGORY_TREE: CategoryNode[] // 5 main categories\nbuildDefaultCategoryState()    // All subcategories checked\ngetSelectedCategories()        // Return active main categories\n```\n\n**CSS Classes**:\n- `.category-filter-tree` -

Existing Related Components (Already Written)\n\n- `ReportListHeader.tsx` - search input + \"Generate New Report\" button\n- `ReportHeader.tsx` - title, breadcrumb, export PDF/CSV buttons\n- `ReportTable.tsx` - paginated table of reports with refresh/download/view actions\n- `VarianceSummary.tsx` - total variance metric display + sparkline\n- `VarianceChart.tsx` - chart visualization\n- `DetailedReportTable.tsx` - full table of report items\n- `NavBar.tsx` - navigation\n- `AccountHeader.tsx` - account detail page header\n\n---\n\n## 14. Data Flow for Report Creation\n\n```\nUser clicks \"Generate New Report\"\n  ↓\nReportListHeader opens CreateReportDialog\n  ↓\nUser selects type (ReportTypeSelector)\nUser selects dates (DateRangeSelector)\nUser selects categories (AccountCategoryFilter)\n  ↓\nReportPreview shows real-time preview\n  ↓\nUser clicks \"Generate Report\"\n  ↓\ncreateReport() Redux thunk fires\n  ↓\nPOST /.netlify/functions/reports with params\n  ↓\nBackend: creates report + report_items\n  ↓\nResponse dispatches to Redux (items list updated)\n  ↓\nDialog closes\n  ↓\nReportListPage re-renders with new report in list\n```\n\n---\n\n## 15. Key Implementation Notes\n\n1. **No Existing AppStyle.md in Accounting app** - Use `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md` (shared style guide)\n2. **Forms use shared base classes** - Build on `.form-label`, `.form-input`, `.form-group`\n3. **Modal pattern is established** - Follow `.modal-overlay`, `.modal-content` structure\n4. **CSS Grid for layouts** - Report type tabs use `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr`\n5. **Date format**: ISO string YYYY-MM-DD for all inputs\n6. **Category state management**: Uses `Record<string, boolean>` for checkbox states\n7. **Redux async operations**: Use thunks, handle pending/fulfilled/rejected states\n8. **Test IDs required**: All interactive elements need `data-testid` attributes\n9. **Color system**: Use CSS custom properties, never hardcode colors\n10. **Accessibility**: Include `aria-label`, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation support\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive exploration covers the full context needed to implement Report-related components while maintaining consistency with existing patterns in the Accounting app."}],"totalDurationMs":79302,"totalTokens":76106,"totalToolUseCount":44,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":312,"cache_read_input_tokens":71051,"output_tokens":4738,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":312},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

The layout consists of the account name and category (asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense) at the top, followed by a transaction list or ledger. Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n\n3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n\n4. CreateReportDialog (N/A)\n   Description: A dialog to specify a report based on the accounts and their transactions.

The page also provides functionality to refresh or regenerate reports based on new parameters and may link back to specific account detail pages when users click on report items. Budget versus actual comparisons are a core feature of these reports.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdH0QZwUJBicXIxYl7ANfnRyzLoKQCwtb1e8Wj\n\n5. ReportDetails (/reports/:id)\n   Description: Details about the contents of a generated report.  The page displays reports that compare actual results to budgeted amounts, both at the account level and potentially at the specific-item level (e.g., big expenses). Reports may be shown as tables, charts, or both, highlighting variances between actual and budgeted figures.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KduvOBXPH0NlcrvAhaRjg7E2zVpwb9xeY8LoBG\n\n6.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills.

Now I'm checking if the CSS classes are properly defined in index.css and verifying that the shared utilities are actually available in the codebase.","signature":"Ep4RCkYICxgCKkAIkBE8ZGJlGYSeqRE2tpWhpveDKqEbTi0HwK3ZHDOabsQPMhHzKa12+b2Gr2ADwXtfZdMgowvI+4cdOJj7O4NmEgwRM4RV74y0ycySYWsaDJxcAYvfpWFO+r0OAiIwjj/GyGr9+rH+xLbu5jDndy8a0TfyICwHXevgi0Q6Ne4lzi5RBvYyDUp4wm881ABOKoUQNnmeMIyg3UP859szQcRh8rUpePwP5iXmVdlTwixEAYGtH5oU133MmFcy8Ap4kuajAybBF5kaDjwIUF3xhW/fJhDTBt3JzPFNRoEFSvDGEoPdZis2b+pSUUM9DTyKPomA61IJn+ksTxsw5cRMb5gZ79O0YUDgncZUrVjOyzuU/KCI+ZSvMQdPWRHNPtqTSFlpCbn5b2Bp1A8c74Bnpocxk8Ujj7514yiRlZcj8wr5GIn7Ut7g4tvbXPJhOfvGJwPpGW6DteRVeoGb/yL1vADiGSXuQ49LOIDtCq+Migf4gi0FeTSkq0v3rpNcervjkziMY8efSkklqM1H9M5yWBJwR1UsqFuEenYn7xU+Kolkq/Ed6pK3SJNtka1kA738BH+rN+oOmzYKalCFfpaiPVIENVY9tZdfEwkQjiIgx9bBHYFLiaDA/K1dA2WYfjV/8+jY8NaOdMzuVxYKiLX3L/zAEXUXw8Vqw6mq9iKYMw7HK8AktlbiCAO+vbmZZMd5MPOaMXg/8rmKZujTDU7TqbINeKYJqWMMr/dHYi3ir0eNqb/+ph9tCFUDVDAhlXrdIB3bvBfsvx0q89btbkFlo2Vhsm9bciUDv/InCmJouCG0JY99JzYGyf1C3iCdsU4IYHmIrXZVOw6SiWCUYP8iMASsFZkmWg9XnRf8zAud91EM9GI9JaBXizVC230fGFPP83NvvUuiqf2tZisKkXrrpc3bQbvQnv9e4tj1m2KIWHVlZ0NS9/ZYuQzhcyoLdGKrCsfE0ZY/6ltyG/Hl4cGfKOLUrLEPsdQTc3A2N9bqMFRio1AbBMUAphyNCDteONlWi9B6p5SOtwHeBfUjdSnSHyUCYjTxATOfcSTYknwgiM9Q5WjcPcQi5d6EC3azfbJ95p3Htbj27xEtTNRVH+XTtUBwJPDbM6pTrkTjWMqzzCloYDCU2I8JQ7OHgMMm+J77eLECU9vkkah1DDkpKE3XrBfevLbpj21iocdn8S3ifleyaCZLBJA3XO9Zerxrl3i+h2OGmPAVc7YIMPSmTX3n5nAxvwpiKDjBB4mM3Cx659hJSKVh8aYUUCuZ0aDXz/ipzjjcZpFZqXFkYTWkjBIBxB0mPyJDUUKRwArzQgSeBmrk0QIel0HPVTt1x+++UrB5A9LvrGkpcqwOYsNBLyCmzEilCPvTBNilTlBF8GTn/Dw/0pWBSHMLps3DMisKmyHG2SmPj45reI/CestSEB6eQSgXGiJ0OiDuO8I50twyNscq8CpQp+1cA3gKuVRFENnMIikBWaTd2cyCmx5ORxu8M0vH0r02/i+r3g6ITNoPNthgSkbf2w7p36121V0mcZNvkfKCyUJRB/nY3HjNqOyh4H1KFNcMHEgPounaoY+8pK/VhWnAUWJTSIUippib9W6HqI2VyfRN3jedabC6AwXDBqXKBRFGuyFq8QZIOP7eLXpL67DDzIfClyMSMtMDXrUGyfx2yJ8NFlH/an1PWeAYny6YCs4xl3hgbGVkp3YOpVLB6gGxTTbm+4g/Ata+URNuxjH7uLNH7rfddGIQpPOSiOpk3zvIdoxVOONo8q0jjN5veKrzTdV8Bv2sVVqIApQkenN/SmJqpb3aNkVrUWvdOR2H6FsFABK1PDEK6gwFMAJ6awhRkkisvnmZkLJiZC5Oj5jz1oSlFKJ1N9+mz++CVfpxDXr/lY8MgL3XCV68looisP5QbZYjC+o7jhgEcKrMOj6CTYhDYY0rc8BO/NwrfbZt3SFYC4dnO0mVlV0eScGDikktW1bgNaToK6v5o2p5gEuF1Frko7YC5VPR4oFo5vq6XJRSZmtHHOP+j8bYqqktqseBaJIE3vCmnKJFQRr/PDfnKjLKdf0PSnJFqds2MW9ZblFK5VT5PoKkyl9rEqABGGiGj+o/3TTnBYoUImDM+uknmiadwQvzDyy52w7tdManOQTXYlCOkEnnRypmZzVkXjnFaqOZM6UanQoflEz1QerSkKIV+RV9QSdRqmY/RbAuiyJ6A8MpRAu2bq5VJEt29POdAiomoUO5YvNiPzWhDw554q0nJXoJCIYtnnpTVDKmtZ47yAcfCsNWILZsF6QBAVzPWSHLbW0vIvgjk4SOEMzIybUDfLwXrMjIYYEjtcpHaXue01Ny/Yp90JlAldE9V3LN6h08OXtaSooVHx3b+ZEQ7ktwOSKekXU+oHA4Yn99y5LXdvd4dATtDEj45lZdPyEydYj9YuZomLVKgbHWCH9VkPyWpPURgBeoQnmDtTDZ5LIVefR707ZJVFbqrca7y35z76Ls59cx5ZLjdidVN3H5s/xM6fjaiYGls6iX4ksRF8OnSADSAYf37ojBUg2SyWtfMly7DCTTTieRDdXtpPxVoAx2WiGOPpHhl7xgj+++1fo26XsSC2/UQzbGQJiRukG0CcwuLUi38uwQ081X87tVrmbNT/G8c6U3cDv9EFpbWc+20XH+2Es1uUOIWR+qatU2CDNEJDH6o5hejII4b3Wxtw9Ib9cEOQyJ8MmM25bm0y5kOf8sd+KduPLDdkY2pMBGPZe8irIWcnsI5tgZckEZNAPagvjwrahx6M3WhHQU50jqkC0bAXQ7Pq6M/ihZ8EgvO2+SWSIhDd3d5q3N0d3If57t40V5MOYAIa6gwbl0ZyHB8LmEjlqHeghePh8J8dGwqM1AMg9Fj4Iig3py5ho0ma/zBQPh7tjhyIn76GRj8pHejQb5N6UyP6yJQqcNrbBauHSblBgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6247,"cache_read_input_tokens":97844,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6247,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"858002b9-b6f5-432f-a8ba-9a6c988c24b2","uuid":"1d7ec97b-9817-4574-80f4-5e38a0c149c5"}

Let me also check the shared utils to make sure they exist.\n\nLet me also double-check the mockup. Wait, I can't load external mockup URLs directly. Let me just focus on verifying the implementation is correct against the test specs.\n\nLet me go through each test case carefully:\n\n### ReportTypeSelector Tests:\n1. ✅ Three report type tabs displayed\n2. ✅ Summary Overview tab has document icon \n3. ✅ Detailed Transactions tab has list icon\n4. ✅ Budget vs Actual tab has comparison icon\n5. ✅ Default selection is \"summary\"\n\n\n6. ✅ Clicking selects a tab \n7. ✅ Selection updates preview (handled by parent)\n8. ✅ Selection persists until changed\n\n### DateRangeSelector Tests:\n1. ✅ Date Range heading\n2. ✅ Start Date and End Date pickers side by side\n3. ✅ Start Date picker allows selecting\n4. ✅ End Date picker allows selecting\n5. ✅ Three preset buttons\n6. ✅ This Month button sets dates\n7. ✅ Last Quarter button sets dates  \n8. ✅ YTD button sets dates\n9. ✅ Manual date entry overrides preset\n10. ✅ Date changes update preview\n11. ✅ Calendar icon displayed\n\n### AccountCategoryFilter Tests:\n1. ✅ Section heading\n2. ✅ Five top-level category checkboxes\n3. ✅ All categories checked by default\n4. ✅ Expand reveals sub-categories\n5. ✅ Collapse hides sub-categories\n6. ✅ Sub-category checkboxes independently selectable\n7. ✅ Unchecking parent unchecks all sub-categories\n8. ✅ Checking parent checks all sub-categories\n9. ✅ Checking all sub-categories fills parent\n10. ✅ Include Zero Balance toggle displayed\n11. ✅ Toggle off by default\n12. ✅ Toggle can be turned on/off\n\nNow I'm verifying the ReportPreview component handles dynamic titles, refresh functionality, proper column headers for different report types, expandable rows with navigation links, and variance formatting. I'm also checking the CreateReportDialog validates required fields, manages the two-panel layout, and properly enables/disables the generate button based on input state.\n\nLooking back at the git history, I can see these components were already implemented in a previous commit, so all the subtasks here are actually complete—the components exist, tests are passing, and everything is functioning as expected.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2312,"cache_read_input_tokens":104842,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2312,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"858002b9-b6f5-432f-a8ba-9a6c988c24b2","uuid":"1718295b-8050-45ab-b730-2e5947674b98"}
