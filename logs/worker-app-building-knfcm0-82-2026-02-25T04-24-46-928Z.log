You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Breadcrumb: Home > Suppliers > Apex Global Logistics > Supplier Details.\n\n2. **SupplierOverview section**:\n   - \"Supplier Overview\" heading\n   - \"Back to Dashboard\" button (top right)\n   - Status badge: \"Status: Active\" (green dot)\n   - Supplier Name: \"Apex Global Logistics\"\n   - Address: 123 Commerce Way, Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98101\n   - Contact: John Smith, (206) 555-0123\n   - Description: \"Leading provider of integrated logistics solutions and supply chain management. Specializing in international freight and warehousing.\"\n\n3. **Tabbed sections**: Documents, Comments, Orders tabs\n\n4. **DocumentsTab** (currently active): Search bar for documents, upload button, and document cards displaying contracts like the Service Agreement 2024.pdf with metadata showing type, upload date, and action icons for viewing and downloading.\n\n5. **CommentsSection**: A collapsible comments area with three existing notes from team members about shipment projections, payment terms, and onboarding, plus an input field for adding new notes.\n\n6. **OrdersSection**: Orders tab available.\n\nNow I'm laying out the orders section with two tabs—one showing upcoming orders with search and status filtering, displaying pending, in-transit, and processing orders with their delivery dates and costs, and another tab for historical orders with a similar search interface showing past deliveries.\n\nI need to work through the component planning tasks: setting up the SupplierDetailsPage structure, then adding test entries for each of the sub-components like SupplierOverview, DocumentsTab, CommentsSection, and OrdersSection, building on what's already documented. Looking at the mockup more carefully, I see \"Documents | Comments | Orders\" styled like tab navigation, but all three sections appear visible simultaneously rather than being exclusive tabs—so they're likely sectioned content areas with navigation anchors rather than a true tabbed interface. Looking at the mockup more carefully, the tabs for Documents, Comments, and Orders seem to be section headers with all content flowing continuously below them rather than a traditional tabbed interface. I'll test them as navigational anchors that users can click to jump between sections. Now I'm reviewing the specific fields I need to validate for the SupplierOverview component—name, address, contact information, description, and status badge.\n\nI also notice the subtask calls for edit and delete functionality for suppliers, which isn't explicitly shown in the mockup. Given that the spec allows for adding necessary features to make the app functional, I should include those actions. For the Documents tab, I need to test the search functionality, document upload capability, and the view/download actions on individual document cards. The Comments section requires testing the input field for adding new comments and verifying that existing comments display with their timestamps and authors. For Orders, I'll need to validate the upcoming and historical tabs, search and filter capabilities by status, and that the order tables contain proper links.\n\nLet me start mapping out the test cases for each component systematically. with Count\n2. Display Comment List - shows comments with dates, text, authors\n3. Add Comment - type in input, submit, appears in list\n4. Expand/Collapse Comments\n\n### OrdersSection:\n1. Display Upcoming/Historical Tabs\n2. Display Upcoming Orders Table - columns: Order ID, Expected Delivery, Status, Total Cost\n3. Display Historical Orders Table - columns: Order ID, Delivery Date, Status, Final Cost\n4. Order ID Links - clicking navigates to order details\n5. Search Upcoming Orders\n6. Search Historical Orders\n7. Filter Upcoming Orders by Status\n8. Status Badges in Order Tables\n\nNow I'm moving into BDD format to write out the test scenarios thoroughly. I'll start with the supplier details page setup, then work through each component's behavior.\n\nWriting BDD test
