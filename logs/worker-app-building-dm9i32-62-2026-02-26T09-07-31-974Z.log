Let me list the relevant directives for backend functions:\n\n1. **Neon tagged template literals**: \"When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal syntax for queries: `sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}```. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\"\n\n2. **Empty string to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns**: \"For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\"\n\n\n3. **Path index for resource ID**: \"Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments). Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\"\n\nNow I'm going through each file to verify compliance. Starting with equipment-notes.ts, I can see the Neon queries are using the correct tagged template syntax, and I need to check whether empty strings are being properly converted to null for UUID and timestamp columns.\n\nFor the equipment ID on line 29, it comes from URL search params which returns string or null, so that's safe. Line 60 has an equipment ID from the request body that could be empty, but there's a guard clause checking for empty values before it gets used. The note ID on line 92 also has proper null checking in place. The path index on line 83 correctly uses index 3 for the resource ID.\n\nNow checking equipment.ts...\n\nall the queries use the Neon tagged template syntax correctly. For date and UUID columns, I'm verifying they handle empty strings properly—installation_date uses the `|| null` pattern in both the POST and PUT operations, which is correct. Photo URL doesn't need this treatment since it's not a date or UUID type.\n\nLooking at the path indices, equipment and recipe IDs are both extracted correctly with fallback to null. Now checking recipes.ts to confirm it follows the same patterns—the recipe materials insert properly casts recipeId as UUID and doesn't have any user-input date columns that could be empty strings. Moving into runs.ts to verify the same standards apply there. I'm spotting a violation in the PUT section—lines 187-189 use nullish coalescing (`??`) for date and UUID columns when they should use logical OR (`||`) to properly convert empty strings to null. so the violations are specifically for DATE, TIMESTAMP, and UUID types where `??` should be replaced with `||`. For other column types like numbers and strings, the nullish coalescing operator is actually the right choice since `||` would incorrectly treat `0` and empty strings as falsy. The only issues I've found so far are in runs.ts lines 187-189 where `start_date`, `end_date`, and `recipe_id` need to use `||` instead of `??`.\n\nLet me verify the path parsing directives across all the functions. The equipment-notes DELETE handler correctly extracts the note ID from index 3 after splitting and filtering the pathname, and I should double-check the equipment.ts comment to make sure the path parsing is consistent there too. I found violations in runs.ts where the PUT handler uses nullish coalescing (`?? null`) instead of logical OR (`|| null`) for DATE and UUID columns—specifically for `start_date`, `end_date`, and `recipe_id`. I should flag this as a directive violation and create a fix task. Let me also check if there are other backend files I haven't reviewed yet, and verify whether the schema directive appears elsewhere in the
