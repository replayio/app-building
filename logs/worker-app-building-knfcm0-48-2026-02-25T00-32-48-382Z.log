Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root.

Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e31e799d-63d1-4d44-9a10-85942a0da33a","uuid":"02b7b2c9-bf31-4a2a-958a-2ca226d7b0af","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    25→   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    26→\n    27→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    28→matching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    29→\n    30→## Worker Execution\n    31→\n    32→The worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    39→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    40→\n    41→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    42→\n    43→## Task System\n    44→\n    45→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→and a `timestamp`:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    60→    }\n    61→  ]\n    62→}\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    66→\n    67→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\"`**:\n    68→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    69→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    70→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    71→\n    72→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    73→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    74→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    75→\n    76→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    77→\n    78→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    79→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    80→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    81→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    82→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    83→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    84→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    85→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    86→\n    87→## Tech Stack\n    88→\n    89→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    90→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    91→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    92→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    93→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    94→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    95→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    96→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    97→\n    98→## Database\n    99→\n   100→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   101→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   102→frontend components.\n   103→\n   104→## Quality Gates\n   105→\n   106→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`).

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_014dzqjrFYGVNa7eAUVGRPLn","session_id":"e31e799d-63d1-4d44-9a10-85942a0da33a","uuid":"9ca2c2f1-00fb-466d-82e2-475ad92d3e8f"}

The software needs separate pages to track recipes, a calendar to schedule production runs, view information about each production run including the recipe / amounts of raw materials used, and track equipment that is available and required by different recipes.  There must be a calendar page.  There must be a run details page.  The app connects to separate apps for tracking inventory and scheduling deliveries so that the the production runs show forecasts for the amounts of materials which will be available.\n\nPages:\n\n1. RecipesPage (/recipes)\n   Description: Page for managing manufacturing recipes. Layout likely includes a table or list of recipes with columns such as recipe name, product, version, and status. There should be controls to add, edit, and delete recipes. Selecting a recipe opens its detailed view (either inline, separate page, or modal). Each recipe contains a breakdown of raw materials and quantities required per production unit, plus possible notes or instructions. Filtering and search for recipes by name or product should be available. This page is focused on defining and maintaining the standard recipes used in production runs.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdlrMSeznvLlgzebcKqNs0DmihQTtVZ9rv61UO\n\n2. CalendarPage (/calendar)\n   Description: Calendar view to schedule and visualize production runs over time. The main layout is a calendar (daily/weekly/monthly views) showing each scheduled production run as an event or block. Users can click on a date to create a new production run or select an existing run to open its details page or modal. Each event shows key info such as product/recipe name, quantity, and status. The page includes navigation controls to move between weeks/months, and may integrate data from external inventory and delivery scheduling apps to visually indicate availability constraints (e.g., color coding runs with material shortages). Drag-and-drop or editing of events may be used to reschedule runs. This page is the central hub for planning when production runs occur.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdTvUTHD7IfSRxAhcbzPKXQNjVd4MGOspvJ9t0\n\n3. RunDetailsPage (/runs/:runId)\n   Description: Detailed view for a specific production run. The layout includes sections for: (1) High-level run info (run ID, date/time, product, associated recipe, planned quantity, status). (2) Recipe and raw materials section listing each material required, the amount needed for the planned quantity, and units. (3) Forecast/availability section showing projected inventory levels for each material at the time of the run, based on data from the separate inventory tracking and delivery scheduling apps. This may include columns like required amount, forecast available amount, shortage/excess, and any pending delivery details. (4) equipment the run will require and availability. Users can adjust quantities, confirm or cancel the run, and view links to related records in the external apps. All information about the selected production run, including recipe and material usage, is visible here.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdBdqSYEMnmAIsi8awdrfjCvQq9WMFZL56Dg2e\n\n4.

The `RootState` is `ReturnType<typeof store.getState>` which should work, but the generic `Record<string, Reducer>` may cause all state slices to be typed as `any`. Let me check what the actual TypeScript error looks like more carefully.\n\nThe errors are:\n- `src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx(250,6): error TS7006: Parameter 'r' implicitly has an 'any' type.`\n- Line 250 is the `(r) =>` in `recipes.filter((r) => ...)`\n\n\n- This means `recipes` is typed as `any[]` because the store's reducer map uses `Record<string, Reducer>`, which loses the specific types of each slice. Even though `RootState` is derived from `store.getState()`, the generic reducer type prevents TypeScript from inferring the actual shape of the state. I need to either cast the state or properly type the reducer map to preserve the individual slice types.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":299,"cache_read_input_tokens":100965,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":299,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e31e799d-63d1-4d44-9a10-85942a0da33a","uuid":"289348fb-fdaf-475e-903a-54f6d9583bd6"}
