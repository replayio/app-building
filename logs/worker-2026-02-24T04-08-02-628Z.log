Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"153a936e-0d54-49fa-831b-17cb1d17bf08","uuid":"51a6fdd5-6a29-45a0-9b2a-4a4c1bb291fb","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":144,"startLine":1,"totalLines":144}}}

Now let me also check the schema file to understand the database structure.\n\nLet me now systematically check each backend function against the writeApp.md directives. The relevant directives for backend are:\n\n1. **Tagged template literal syntax**: \"When using the neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax for queries: `sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}```. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\"\n\n2. **Empty string to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID**: \"For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`.\"\n\n\n3. **Resource ID path index**: \"Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments). Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\"\n\n4. **initSchema**: \"The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module.\"\n\n5. **Clean, working code**: \"Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data.\"\n\nNow I'll go through each function file and verify it follows these directives.\n\nIn clients.ts, all queries use tagged template literals correctly, the empty string to null conversion for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID fields is handled properly with the `|| null` pattern, the resource ID is correctly extracted at index 3, and there are no TODOs or placeholder code.\n\nFor tasks.ts, I'm checking the same criteria—tagged template literals, proper null handling for date fields, correct resource ID indexing, and clean implementation without placeholders.\n\nNow moving through individuals.ts to verify the same patterns are applied consistently across contact history operations.\n\nI'm noticing a potential issue with how COALESCE is being used in the update handler—when contact_date comes in as an empty string, it gets converted to null, but then COALESCE preserves the old value instead of actually clearing it. This means users can't actually delete a date field, which is a business logic problem rather than a directive violation, but worth flagging.\n\nThe directive itself is being followed correctly with `|| null` instead of `?? null`, and I'm verifying the resource ID extraction and checking that all database operations are properly isolated to backend functions.","signature":"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

Let me check the schema for deals, attachments, and timeline_events tables — there seem to be backend functions missing for these. But the directive check is about the existing backend functions, not about missing ones. Let me also check if there are deals-related backend functions that should exist.\n\nActually, let me re-read the directive about DELETE:\n\"If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions. Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\"\n\nThis is actually a frontend directive, not a backend one. But it mentions that we should check that the backend supports all the operations needed. \n\nNow I'm systematically going through each directive from writeApp.md to verify the backend functions. Starting with the tagged template literal syntax requirement for the neon serverless driver — I need to confirm that all query files are using the correct `sql` tagged template syntax rather than the function call approach.\n\nChecking the second directive about converting empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns, I'm verifying each file's handling of these conversions and noting where the `||` operator is appropriately applied versus where it's used on TEXT fields where it's less critical. Finishing up the contact history handler with the COALESCE pattern for updates, then verifying that all the Netlify functions are correctly extracting resource IDs from path index 3, with individuals also handling a sub-resource at index 4.\n\nNow I'm checking the `initSchema` function — it's exported and accepts the database URL as a parameter, uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency, but there's a potential issue: it drops all tables first before recreating them, which technically works but might not align with the \"safe to re-run\" requirement since re-running would wipe existing data. The DROP TABLE statements make this function destructive on re-run, which violates the idempotency requirement, even though the comment suggests this is intentional for ephemeral test branches. I'm torn between flagging this as a directive violation versus accepting it as a deliberate design choice for their testing strategy, but I think I should flag it since the deployment script might rely on safe re-execution.\n\nNow I'm scanning through the backend functions and noticing a gap — there are only three function files covering clients, tasks, and individuals, but the schema includes tables for deals, deal_stage_history, deal_writeups, and deal_contacts that don't have corresponding backend functions.\n\nI need to refocus though. My task is specifically to check for writeApp.md directive violations in the existing backend functions, not to identify missing ones. The directive about database access being centralized in Netlify functions is what I should be validating against the three functions that do exist.\n\nLooking at what I've actually found so far: the backend functions are using tagged template literals correctly, handling null conversions properly, and using the right path indices. The main potential issue is whether the schema's destructive DROP TABLE statements on re-runs align with the idempotent safety requirement, though that might be intentional design.\n\nThe bigger question is whether missing backend functions for deals, attachments, and timeline_events constitutes a directive violation—the schema defines these tables, but there's no corresponding API layer to serve them, which could be problematic if the frontend expects them.\n\nLet me refocus on the actual scope: checking existing backend functions against writeApp.md directives specifically. Looking at the directive list, I need to verify the Neon tagged template literal syntax and the null conversion rules for date/timestamp fields.\n\nChecking clients.ts against these requirements...\n\nFor directive 5, all the queries are using tagged template literals correctly. For directive 6, I need to verify that empty strings are converted to null for date and timestamp fields — looking at the create, import, and update handlers, the UUID is auto-generated, date_acquired isn't being set in the insert, and updated_at uses the database now() function, so there's no issue with unhandled empty strings on temporal or UUID columns. ✓\n\nNow checking the tasks table, which has UUID and TIMESTAMPTZ columns — I need to verify the same pattern holds for how those fields are handled in the handlers. Checking the `contact_history` table in individuals.ts — the `contact_date` field properly uses `|| null` for TIMESTAMPTZ values in both create and update handlers, including the COALESCE pattern for updates.\n\nMoving to schema.ts now, where I'm verifying that `initSchema` is properly exported, accepts a database URL parameter without reading from environment variables, and uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements to ensure idempotency.\n\nI'm noticing the DROP TABLE statements at the beginning are problematic—they destroy existing data on each run, which contradicts the requirement for safe re-execution. While the subsequent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` makes the operation technically idempotent in terms of schema structure, the DROP statements mean the function isn't truly safe to re-run since it wipes all data. This is a violation of the stated requirement.\n\nHowever, I'm realizing the DROPs might be intentional for the ephemeral branch testing strategy, where starting with a clean slate is desirable. But if this same initSchema is used in deployment, dropping all tables would be catastrophic. I need to check whether the deploy script actually calls this function and what the intended behavior should be in that context.\n\nThe directive is explicit though: initSchema must be idempotent and safe to re-run. DROP TABLE statements directly contradict that requirement, so this is a violation I should flag regardless of the testing context.\n\nI've also reviewed the rest of the code for other potential violations—checking for any raw SQL query calls instead of tagged template literals—and everything else appears to follow the required patterns correctly.\n\nSo my main finding is the DROP TABLE statements in schema.ts violating the idempotency requirement. I should just flag this issue and move on to let the fix job handle it. Let me scan through the rest of the code for other violations. I'm noticing something in the clients.ts file—the handleUpdate function has asymmetric logic for the source field compared to the others, where undefined values get converted to null without the COALESCE protection that name, type, and status have, which could accidentally clear existing source values. I'm realizing the COALESCE pattern for name/type/status preserves old values when null is passed, but source lacks that protection—undefined becomes null and overwrites the existing value. This might be intentional if the frontend always sends complete payloads, so it's not necessarily a directive violation. The real issue seems to be the DROP TABLE in schema.ts, though I should verify whether that script counts as a \"backend function\" under the writeApp.md scope, since the directive specifically mentions the Netlify functions directory. I need to be systematic about this and check every backend-related file, including configuration files like netlify.toml and the Playwright config since the directives explicitly reference them in the context of backend setup. Let me identify what else I might have missed and finalize my

Now let me systematically report my findings for each file.\n\n## Systematic Check: writeApp.md Directives vs. Backend Functions\n\nI'm checking all backend files against the writeApp.md directives. The relevant backend directives are:\n\n1. **Neon tagged template literals only** (line 67) — NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`\n2. **Empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID** (line 70) — Use `value || null` not `value ?? null`\n3. **Resource ID at path index 3** (line 74-75) — segments[3] for resource ID\n4. **initSchema requirements** (lines 34-47) — idempotent, safe to re-run, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`\n5. **Monorepo base setting** (line 59) — `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` in netlify.toml\n6. **Clean code** (line 26) — No TODOs, placeholders, or mock data\n\n---\n\n### Checking: `netlify/functions/clients.ts`\n- **Tagged template literals**: All queries use tagged template literal syntax. No `sql()` calls. **PASS**\n- **Empty strings to null**: `source || null` used correctly. UUID ids are auto-generated. **PASS**\n- **Resource ID path index**: `segments[3]` on line 31. **PASS**\n- **No TODOs/placeholders**: None found. **PASS**\n\n### Checking: `netlify/functions/tasks.ts`\n- **Tagged template literals**: All queries use tagged template literal syntax. No `sql()` calls. **PASS**\n- **Empty strings to null**: `client_id || null` (UUID), `deal_id || null` (UUID), `due_date || null` (TIMESTAMPTZ) — all use `|| null`. **PASS**\n- **Resource ID path index**: `segments[3]` on line 33. **PASS**\n- **No TODOs/placeholders**: None found. **PASS**\n\n### Checking: `netlify/functions/individuals.ts`\n- **Tagged template literals**: All queries use tagged template literal syntax. No `sql()` calls. **PASS**\n- **Empty strings to null**: `contact_date || null` (TIMESTAMPTZ) used in both create and update. **PASS**\n- **Resource ID path index**: `segments[3]` on line 33, `segments[4]` on line 34, `segments[5]` on lines 65/74. **PASS**\n- **No TODOs/placeholders**: None found. **PASS**\n\n### Checking: `scripts/schema.ts`\n- **Tagged template literals**: All queries use tagged template literal syntax. **PASS**\n- **initSchema requirements**:\n  - Exported function accepting database URL string: **PASS**\n  - Does not read `DATABASE_URL` from env: **PASS**\n  - Uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables: **PASS**\n  - **Idempotent and safe to re-run**: Lines 7-20 contain `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` for every table before recreating them. This makes the function destructive on re-run — all data is lost. The directive says initSchema must be \"idempotent and safe to re-run\" using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. The DROP statements undermine this, especially since the deploy script uses the same initSchema. **FAIL**\n\n### Checking: `netlify.toml`\n- **Monorepo base setting**: `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` present on line 2. **PASS**\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**1 violation found**: `scripts/schema.ts` contains `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` statements (lines 7-20) that violate the initSchema requirement to be \"idempotent and safe to re-run.\" The `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` pattern is meant to allow re-running without data loss, but the DROP statements destroy all tables and data first.\n\nLet me add a fix job for this violation."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":199,"cache_read_input_tokens":58727,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":199,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"153a936e-0d54-49fa-831b-17cb1d17bf08","uuid":"00a64c5c-a5ec-4394-8828-43c3fbbf31d9"}
