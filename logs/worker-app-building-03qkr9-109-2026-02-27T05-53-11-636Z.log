No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips).

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend.

Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`.

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Now let me start **Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage**. I need to check all SupplierDetailsPage test entries in `docs/tests.md` against the testSpec.md directives. Let me re-read the directives carefully and then systematically check each entry.\n\nThe **testSpec.md directives** are:\n1. Images of different pages might not have consistent styling/navigation — prioritize consistency over exact adherence\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — write a test entry for each one\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows\n4. For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result\n5. For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying change is persisted and side effects occur (exactly one, no duplicates)\n6. Button and control appearance matters — test entry should verify appearance\n7. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions visible in configuration UI\n11. State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update appropriately\n\nNow let me systematically go through each SupplierDetailsPage test entry section by section.\n\n## Checking SupplierDetailsPage test entries in tests.md\n\nThe SupplierDetailsPage section starts at line 336 and covers these subsections:\n- SectionTabLinks (lines 342-363)\n- SupplierOverview (lines 364-413)\n- DocumentsTab (lines 424-473)\n- CommentsSection (lines 475-514)\n- OrdersSection (lines 516-597)\n\nLet me check each one systematically.\n\n### Checking: SectionTabLinks (lines 342-363)\n\nEntries:\n- **Display Section Tab Links** - Tests presence of three tab link buttons. ✅ Specifies exact text.\n- **Click Documents Tab Scrolls to Documents Section** - ✅ Specifies action result (scrolls to Documents).\n- **Click Comments Tab Scrolls to Comments Section** - ✅ Specifies action result.\n- **Click Orders Tab Scrolls to Orders Section** - ✅ Specifies action result.\n\nNo violations found in SectionTabLinks.\n\n### Checking: SupplierOverview (lines 364-413)\n\nEntries:\n- **Display Supplier Name** - ✅ Tests display of heading \"Supplier Overview\" and label/value.\n- **Display Supplier Address** - ✅ Tests multi-line address display.\n- **Display Contact Information** - ✅ Tests contact name, phone, email.\n- **Display Supplier Description** - ✅ Tests description text.\n- **Display Status Badge** - ✅ Tests color-coded badges for all statuses.\n- **Back to Dashboard Button Navigates to Dashboard** - ✅ Specifies exact navigation target /.\n- **Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog** - ✅ Tests modal opens pre-filled, saves changes, persists.\n- **Edit Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Modify Supplier** - ✅ Tests cancel behavior.\n- **Edit Supplier Dialog Validation** - ✅ Tests validation on Supplier Name field.\n- **Delete Supplier with Confirmation** - ✅ Tests confirmation dialog, deletion, navigation to /, removal from SuppliersList.\n\nChecking directive 5 (mutation side effects): The Edit Supplier entry tests persistence. The Delete entry tests navigation and removal from Dashboard. \n\nChecking directive 7 (modal dialog testing): Edit dialog has save, cancel, and validation tests. Delete has confirmation and action tests. ✅\n\nNo violations found in SupplierOverview.\n\n### Checking: DocumentsTab (lines 424-473)\n\nEntries:\n- **Display Document Cards with Details** - ✅ Tests file name, type, date, action icons.\n- **Display Multiple Document Cards** - ✅ Lists all three documents with details.\n- **Search Documents by Name** - ✅ Tests search filtering.\n- **Search Documents Clears Results** - ✅ Tests clearing search.\n- **Upload Document Button Opens Upload Dialog** - ✅ Tests file upload with type field. \n- **Upload Document Dialog Cancel Does Not Upload** - ✅ Tests cancel behavior.\n- **View Document Action** - ✅ Specifies action (opens in new tab).\n- **Download Document Action** - ✅ Specifies action (downloads file).\n\nChecking directive 8 (file uploads): The Upload Document entry mentions \"file upload dialog opens allowing the user to select a file from their device\" — ✅ supports file uploads.\n\nChecking directive 9 (import/upload dialogs format documentation): The Upload Document entry specifies the dialog includes a field for document type with examples \"Contract\", \"Certification\", \"Agreement\". However, it does NOT mention format documentation being visible to the user. But this is a document upload, not an import dialog with specific data format requirements — the user is uploading arbitrary files, not importing structured data. This directive is more about CSV/data imports. ✅ No violation.\n\nChecking directive 7 (modal dialogs): Upload dialog has save, cancel tests. ✅\n\nNo violations found in DocumentsTab.\n\n### Checking: CommentsSection (lines 475-514)\n\nEntries:\n- **Display Comments Header with Count** - ✅ Tests heading with count and toggle icon.\n- **Display Comment List with Timestamps and Authors** - ✅ Tests all three comments in reverse chronological order.\n- **Add Comment via Input Field** - ✅ Tests adding comment, appearance at top, count increment, field cleared.\n- **Add Comment Persists After Reload** - ✅ Tests persistence (directive 5).\n- **Collapse and Expand Comments Section** - ✅ Tests toggle behavior.\n- **Empty Comment Validation** - ✅ Tests empty submission prevention.\n\nNo violations found in CommentsSection.\n\n### Checking: OrdersSection (lines 516-597)\n\nEntries:\n- **Display Upcoming and Historical Order Tabs** - ✅ Tests heading and two tabs.\n- **Display Upcoming Orders Table with Correct Columns** - ✅ Tests columns.\n- **Display Upcoming Orders Data** - ✅ Lists all three orders with details. Order IDs are clickable links.\n- **Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details** - ✅ Specifies exact navigation target /orders/PO-78901.\n- **Display Historical Orders Table with Correct Columns** - ✅ Tests columns.\n- **Display Historical Orders Data** - ✅ Lists all three orders with details.\n- **Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details** - ✅ Specifies exact navigation target.\n- **Search Upcoming Orders** - ✅ Tests search filtering.\n- **Search Historical Orders** - ✅ Tests search filtering.\n- **Filter Upcoming Orders by Status** - ✅ Tests status filter with clear.\n- **Status Badges in Upcoming Orders** - ✅ Tests color-coded badges.\n- **Status Badges in Historical Orders** - ✅ Tests color-coded badges.\n- **Switch Between Tabs** - ✅ Tests tab switching behavior.\n\nNo violations found in OrdersSection.\n\n**Subtask 1 Summary**: I've systematically checked all SupplierDetailsPage test entries (SectionTabLinks: 4 entries, SupplierOverview: 10 entries, DocumentsTab: 8 entries, CommentsSection: 6 entries, OrdersSection: 13 entries) against all testSpec.md directives.

N/A for code review.\n\n**Directive 2: Test entry requirements satisfied by app code** - Need to check each component against its test entries. Let me go through them:\n\nSupplierOverview:\n- \"Display Supplier Name\" - ✅ Shows supplier.name\n- \"Display Supplier Address\" - ✅ Shows multi-line address (split by comma)\n\n\n- \"Display Contact Information\" - ✅ Shows contact_name, phone, email\n- \"Display Supplier Description\" - ✅ Shows description\n- \"Display Status Badge\" - ✅ Shows color-coded status badge with Active (green), Inactive (gray), On Hold (yellow), Suspended (red)\n- \"Back to Dashboard Button\" - ✅ navigate(\"/\")\n- \"Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog\" - ✅ EditSupplierModal with pre-filled form\n- \"Edit Supplier Dialog Cancel\" - ✅ Cancel button closes modal\n- \"Edit Supplier Dialog Validation\" - ✅ Validates name is required\n- \"Delete Supplier with Confirmation\" - ✅ ConfirmDialog with correct message\n\nNow checking the DocumentsTab component—it displays document cards with file name, type, date, and action icons, supports searching by file name, and handles uploading, viewing, and downloading documents through appropriate dialogs and handlers. The SupplierCommentsSection renders a header showing the comment count.\n\nFor the comments, I'm verifying the list displays in chronological order from the backend, the input field accepts new comments via Enter or a Post button, empty submissions are blocked, and the section can collapse and expand. The OrdersSection has two tabs for upcoming and historical orders, with the upcoming tab showing Order ID, Expected Delivery, Status, and Total Cost columns that map the order data correctly, and order IDs link to the detail pages.\n\nThe historical orders tab displays Order ID, Delivery Date, Status, and Final Cost with the same linking behavior. Both tabs support searching by order ID and filtering upcoming orders by status with color-coded badges. Tab switching works via state management, and all interactive elements have the proper data-testid attributes for testing.\n\nNow I'm verifying the remaining directives: the netlify.toml configuration has the correct base path set, all three Netlify functions use the tagged template literal syntax for database queries, and I'm checking whether empty strings are being converted to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns—so far the POST endpoints are handling text fields correctly, though I need to verify the UUID handling in the supplier-comments function. supplierId is correctly extracted from the fourth segment of the URL path after splitting. The same pattern holds for the other supplier-related endpoints. For the modal directives, there's no need for searchable dropdowns since we're only editing the supplier's own fields, and the breadcrumb and tab navigation don't have duplicates. All custom components are being used instead of native HTML selects.\n\nDocumentsTab implements file-type-specific icons for different formats and uses a hidden file input pattern for uploads. The page applies the correct padding classes across all root elements.

This is a scroll action, not navigation. ✅\n- Same for Comments and Orders tabs. ✅\n\n**Directive 4: Avoid getByText() with common words**\n- No `getByText()` calls found. Uses `getByTestId()` throughout. ✅\n\n\n- The test IDs match the component source (`supplier-detail-tabs`, `tab-documents`, `tab-comments`, `tab-orders`), there are no `.toPass()` calls, no unnecessary `beforeEach` cleanup, and the 30000ms timeout handles backend round-trips appropriately. ✅\n\nLooking at the supplier-details-overview spec, the navigation tests properly verify URL changes to the dashboard, and the side effects are checked exactly once—the edit test confirms the phone update in the overview, and the delete test verifies both the navigation and that the supplier no longer appears. ✅ The file avoids getByText with common words, uses atomic assertions instead of `.toPass()`, applies generous timeouts for backend operations, and marks multi-step flows with `test.slow()`. ✅\n\nNow checking the document upload tests — they're using `setInputFiles()` correctly for file handling, relying on `getTestId` selectors, and the assertions look solid so far. I'm continuing through the test files, checking supplier-details-orders.spec.ts for navigation verification and other directives. The upcoming order ID links properly navigate to order details pages with the correct URL patterns, and I'm verifying the historical orders section follows the same navigation standards.\n\nNow I'm examining the \"Filter Upcoming Orders by Status\" test more closely to ensure it's correctly validating that filtered rows match the expected status. The count could shift between when it's captured and when the loop runs, but since there's no `.toPass()` block wrapping this, it doesn't violate the directive—just not the most robust approach. The timeouts look generous at 30 seconds for loads and 15 seconds for filters, and the test IDs are all consistent with the component source. Now I'm checking whether any tests are using `getByText()` with common words that could cause flakiness. me look again...\n- supplier-details-tab-links.spec.ts: No `getByText()` usage. ✅\n- supplier-details-overview.spec.ts: No `getByText()` usage. ✅\n- supplier-details-documents.spec.ts: No `getByText()` usage. ✅\n- supplier-details-comments.spec.ts: No `getByText()` usage. ✅\n- supplier-details-orders.spec.ts: No `getByText()` usage. ✅\n\nAll good. No violations found in any of the test files.\n\nLet me double-check a few more things:\n- **Directive 8: No unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach** - None of the test files have `beforeEach` hooks.
