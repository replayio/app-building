You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

The form remains visible and the password is not reset.\n\n#### Successful password reset navigates to /clients\n- **Initial state:** The reset password form is displayed.\n- **Action:** User enters \"newpassword123\" in both the password input and confirm password input, then clicks \"Reset Password\".\n- **Expected:** The form submits the new password to the backend. On success, the browser navigates to /clients, displaying the ClientsListPage.\n\n#### Submit button shows loading state during submission\n- **Initial state:** The reset password form is displayed.\n- **Action:** User enters matching passwords and clicks \"Reset Password\".\n- **Expected:** While the request is in progress, the submit button text changes to \"Resetting...\" and the button is disabled to prevent duplicate submissions.\n\n#### Error message displayed on server error\n- **Initial state:** The reset password form is displayed.\n- **Action:** User enters matching passwords and clicks \"Reset Password\", but the server returns an error response (e.g., invalid or expired token).\n- **Expected:** An error message is displayed below the inputs (e.g., \"Invalid or expired token\"). The form remains visible so the user can retry.\n\n#### Error message displayed on network failure\n- **Initial state:** The reset password form is displayed.\n- **Action:** User enters matching passwords and clicks \"Reset Password\", but a network error occurs.\n- **Expected:** An error message \"Network error\" is displayed below the inputs. The form remains visible so the user can retry.\n\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n\nComponents: ConfirmEmailPage\n\n### ConfirmEmailPage\n\n#### Loading state displayed while confirming email with token\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=somevalidtoken. The API request to confirm the email is in progress.\n- **Expected:** The page displays a loading message \"Confirming your email...\" in muted text while the confirmation request is being processed.\n\n#### Successful confirmation shows success message and redirects to /clients\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=somevalidtoken.\n- **Expected:** After the API returns a successful response, the loading message is replaced by a success message \"Email confirmed! Redirecting...\" in primary text. After a brief delay (approximately 2 seconds), the browser automatically navigates to /clients, displaying the ClientsListPage.\n\n#### Missing token shows error message\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email without a token query parameter (no ?token=...).\n- **Expected:** The page immediately displays an error message \"No confirmation token provided\" in red text. No API request is made. The page does not redirect.\n\n#### Invalid or expired token shows error message\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=invalidtoken where the token does not exist, has already been used, or has expired.\n- **Expected:** After the API returns an error response, the page displays an error message \"Invalid or expired token\" in red text. The page does not redirect.\n\n#### Network error shows error message\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=sometoken but a network error occurs during the API request.\n- **Expected:** The page displays an error message \"Network error\" in red text. The page does not redirect.\n\n#### Auto-login after successful confirmation stores auth token\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=somevalidtoken and the API returns a successful response that includes an auth token.\n- **Expected:** The auth token from the response is stored in localStorage. The user is automatically logged in — after redirecting to /clients, the sidebar user area shows the user's avatar, display name, and sign-out button instead of the \"Sign In\" button.\n","numLines":1078,"startLine":1,"totalLines":1078}}}

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d554f755-b1e2-470d-a469-fc65a862c321","uuid":"e951c2a4-7410-4031-82c5-97b54ffb824e","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

Let me create my todo list and work through each job.\n\nFrom the mockup, I can see the ClientsListPage has:\n1. A heading \"Clients\" at the top\n2. Import, Export, and \"Add New Client\" buttons in the top right\n3. Search bar: \"Search clients by name, tag, or contact...\"\n4. Filter dropdowns: Status: All, Tags: All, Source: All\n5.

Each row includes a three-dot action menu, and pagination shows \"Showing 1-50 of 324 clients\" with navigation controls\n\nI'm also noting the visual details: status badges use color coding (green for active, gray for inactive, yellow for prospects, red/orange for churned), tags appear as comma-separated badges, primary contacts display as \"Name (Title)\", deal counts show the number with total value, and next tasks include descriptions with dates.\n\nNow I'm breaking down the component structure I need to build: a main ClientsTable component, separate components for search/filters, pagination, an add client modal, import/export functionality, and a wrapper for the overall page layout. Let me map out which planning jobs correspond to each of these pieces.\n\nI notice the mockup sidebar doesn't match the revised version in AppRevisions.md, so I'll go with the updated navigation structure that includes Contacts and Team instead of Dashboard and Reports. Now I'll work through each planning job systematically to set up the tests and documentation.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3860,"cache_read_input_tokens":52940,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3860,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d554f755-b1e2-470d-a469-fc65a862c321","uuid":"5540e81f-e43d-45c9-930a-1f6a4cda5892"}
