[2026-02-26T14:21:52.085Z] Running task: 2 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md)
[2026-02-26T14:21:52.085Z]   - FixViolationNavDuplicateLinks: Fix TopNavBar.tsx where all 4 nav link onClick handlers call navigate('/'), making them duplicate links to the same URL. The directive says 'Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL.' The nav items have different href paths (/, /#suppliers, /#orders, /#inventory) but the onClick ignores these. Fix the onClick handlers to use hash-based scrolling so Suppliers scrolls to the suppliers section, Orders scrolls to orders section, etc. on the dashboard page.
[2026-02-26T14:21:52.085Z]   - RunTests: Verify tests pass after fix

The test spec says:\n- Click Suppliers Nav Link → navigated to / (the DashboardPage)\n- Click Orders Nav Link → navigated to / (the DashboardPage)\n- Click Inventory Nav Link → navigated to / (the DashboardPage)\n\nBut the issue is that the directive says \"Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL.\" The nav items have different `href` paths (`/`, `/#suppliers`, `/#orders`, `/#inventory`) but the onClick ignores these and all navigate to `/`.\n \nI need to update the onClick handlers to use the actual item paths for navigation, then implement hash-based scrolling to the relevant dashboard sections. This means adding id attributes to each section and updating the test specs to reflect that clicking a nav link navigates to the dashboard and scrolls to the corresponding section. - `<UpcomingOrdersTable orders={orders} />` - `#orders`\n- `<SuppliersList suppliers={suppliers} />` - `#suppliers`\n- There's no inventory component, but the nav has an `#inventory` item. Since there's no inventory section, I should perhaps just add the id to a placeholder or skip it.\n\nActually, re-reading the directive: \"Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL.\" The key issue is that all 4 links point to the same URL (`/`) because the onClick overrides them all with `navigate(\"/\")`. The fix is to make each link navigate to its unique path.\n\nThe href values are already unique (`/`, `/#suppliers`, `/#orders`, `/#inventory`), so the fix is to make the onClick use the `item.path` instead of hardcoding `/`.\n\nNow I need to implement the fix by updating the onClick handler to extract the hash from the path and navigate there, then scroll to the corresponding element with a setTimeout to ensure the DOM is ready.\n\nWriting navigation handler... Writing the click handler...\n\nNow I need to add `id` attributes to the dashboard sections so the navigation can scroll to them. I'm looking at the existing components—the suppliers list and upcoming orders table need IDs added to their root elements, but there's no inventory section even though it's in the navigation, so I need to decide whether to create that component or remove the nav item.\n\nActually, since the task is just to make the onClick handlers work with hash-based scrolling, I can leave the inventory link as-is—it'll navigate to `/#inventory` even if there's no matching element to scroll to, which keeps the URLs unique. Let me add the IDs to the existing sections and update the handlers, then check if there are any existing tests for this behavior.","signature":"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

dialog,\nThen the dialog closes,\nAnd no document is added to the document list,\nAnd the document count remains unchanged.\n\n### OrderHistory\n\n**Display Timeline of Events**\nGiven the order has history entries,\nWhen the OrderDetailsPage loads,\nThen the \"Order History\" section displays a vertical timeline of events in reverse chronological order (newest first).\n\n**Display Event Timestamp and Description**\nGiven a history entry for \"Oct 30, 2024, 10:30 AM\" with description \"Status changed to 'Shipped' by System.\",\nWhen the OrderDetailsPage loads,\nThen that timeline entry shows the date \"Oct 30, 2024, 10:30 AM\" and the text \"Status changed to 'Shipped' by System.\".\n\n**Display All History Entries**\nGiven the order has four history entries,\nWhen the OrderDetailsPage loads,\nThen all four entries are displayed in reverse chronological order:\n- Oct 30, 2024, 10:30 AM — Status changed to 'Shipped' by System.\n- Oct 28, 2024, 2:15 PM — Invoice received and linked.\n- Oct 26, 2024, 4:00 PM — Order Approved by Jane Doe.\n- Oct 26, 2024, 9:00 AM — Order Created by John Smith.\n\n**Timeline Entry Icons**\nGiven history entries have different event types,\nWhen the OrderDetailsPage loads,\nThen each timeline entry displays a distinct icon based on event type: status change icon for status changes, document icon for document events, approval/checkmark icon for approvals, and plus icon for creation.\n\n**History Entry Created on Status Change**\nGiven the user edits the order status via the Edit dialog in OrderSummary,\nWhen the user changes the status from \"Approved\" to \"Shipped\" and saves,\nThen exactly one new history entry is added to OrderHistory with the timestamp of the change, the description of what changed (e.g. \"Status changed to 'Shipped'\"), and the actor who made the change.\n\n**History Entry Created on Line Item Modification**\nGiven the user adds, edits, or deletes a line item,\nWhen the modification is saved,\nThen exactly one new history entry is added to OrderHistory describing the line item change (e.g. \"Line item SKU-A101 quantity changed from 20 to 25\" or \"Line item SKU-D404 added\") with the timestamp and actor.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":29,"oldLines":30,"newStart":29,"newLines":30,"lines":[" When the page loads,"," Then the top navigation bar displays a \"Suppliers\" link.","

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker.
