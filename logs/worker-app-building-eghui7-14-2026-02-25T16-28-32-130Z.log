This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

The app is tracking the inventory held of a variety of categorized materials and is broadly similar to an accounting platform.  There is a global set of accounts (inventory, consumer, producer) which can be customized, and within each account there are a variety of materials and their quantity (in customizable units).  Each account / material can be further subdivided into batches where the amount of material in each batch is tracked separately.  Transactions can be recorded and use a double entry system where credits / debits must balance.  Transactions can either reuse batches or create new ones.  newly created batches remember the lineage of batches they were created from.\n\nPages:\n\n1.

[2026-02-25T16:24:43.526Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01DUNbaCBuuga4s5Z95HJgLs","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have all the files I need. Let me systematically go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecNewTransactionPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations\n\nLet me review the testSpec.md directives and check each test entry against them:\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n1. Images of different pages might not have consistent styling or navigation. Prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements. Test all columns including joins/computed values.\n\n\n4. For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\n5. For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects (e.g., history/timeline entries).\n6. Button and control appearance matters: verify appearance, not just existence.\n7. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions.\n11. State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of app update.\n\nNow let me check the NewTransactionPage test entries to see how well they align with these requirements.\n\nLooking at the components involved—BasicInfoForm, QuantityTransfersSection, BatchAllocationSection, PostButton, CancelButton—I'm going through the existing test coverage. The BasicInfoForm tests cover the date picker with calendar icon and format verification, reference ID input with placeholder, multi-line description textarea, and transaction type dropdown with chevron and available options. The user interaction tests verify that dates can be changed, reference IDs can be typed, descriptions accept multi-line input, and transaction types can be selected.\n\nFor QuantityTransfersSection, I'm checking that the section displays with proper column headers and starts empty, then verifies the inline add row controls work correctly. The tests confirm that clicking to add a transfer creates a new row, both source and destination account dropdowns populate with available accounts, amount fields accept numeric input, source batch ID is optional free text, and the unit selector functions properly. There's also coverage for pre-filled transfer data coming from navigation and delete functionality for removing rows.\n\nNow moving into BatchAllocationSection, I'm verifying the section heading and column headers display, the section starts empty, and the inline add row appears with the create new batch button. - Cancel with unsaved data shows confirmation dialog - OK\n- Confirming cancel discards and navigates - OK\n- Clicking Stay returns to form - OK\n- Page header displays \"New Transaction\" title - OK\n- Sidebar highlights Transactions as active - OK\n\nNow I'm checking these against the spec more carefully. The mockup specifies the layout should have a header with title and buttons, form sections for basic info like date and reference ID, the quantity transfers list, and batch allocation. These test cases seem to cover all the main visible elements pretty well.\n\nFor the interactive elements, I need to verify each one works as expected: the Post button should navigate to the transaction detail page, Cancel goes back to the transactions list, the add buttons create new rows in their respective tables, delete icons remove rows, and all dropdowns display their options. I'm also checking that posting a transaction updates the listing and account balances, and that batch allocations actually create new batches in the system. Finally, I should confirm the Post button has prominent styling while the Cancel button needs to be checked.\n\nLooking at the modal dialogs and state-changing actions, the cancel confirmation should have Confirm and Stay buttons, and I need to verify that transactions properly update account balances and create batches with the right lineage. I couldn't access the mockup image directly, but based on the spec it seems fairly complete. I'm double-checking the double-entry balance validation test exists—it does—though the wording around source and destination amounts could be clearer.\n\nLet me reconsider what might be missing by looking more carefully at directive 2 about inventorying every visible element. I should try downloading that NewTransactionPage mockup from the utfs.io link using curl to actually see what's there.\n\nWait, I'm getting ahead of myself — the task is to check against the directives themselves, not to independently verify against the mockup. Let me focus on what those three directives are actually asking for: consistency across pages, comprehensive element coverage in tests, and not substituting simpler implementations for what the spec requires.\n\nNow looking at the remaining directives, I need to ensure tests cover exact navigation targets for clickable elements, verify data mutations persist correctly with proper side effects, check that button appearance matches the mockup precisely, and thoroughly test modal behavior.\n\nFor the systematic verification approach, I should focus on what I can actually assess from the spec itself rather than trying to download additional resources.\n\nLooking at the test entries more carefully, I notice a potential issue with directive 5 around side effects—the balance validation test doesn't fully specify how the balance determination works in the double-entry system, though the description about source and destination amounts seems reasonable enough.\n\nScanning through the component list in the test spec, I'm noticing the page claims to have BasicInfoForm, QuantityTransfersSection, BatchAllocationSection, PostButton, and CancelButton, but the test entries don't seem to cover all of these components equally.\n\nThe test entries themselves look fairly solid overall—the pre-filled transfer data test is more about state verification than navigation targeting, so it doesn't violate directive 4. I think I can move forward with the remaining subtasks.\n\nI need to download the mockup image to systematically verify that the test entries cover all visible elements as directive 2 requires. Let me work through this methodically, checking each test entry against what's actually in the mockup.\n\nFor the component and test directives, I'm noticing there's no dedicated new-transaction test file—only dashboard.spec.ts and deployment.spec.ts exist. That's a potential gap I need to investigate further as I proceed with my

Let me analyze it carefully and compare against the test entries.\n\nFrom the mockup I can see:\n1. **Header**: \"New Transaction\" title on the left, \"Cancel\" button (secondary/outline) and \"Post\" button (primary/blue) on the right\n2. **Section 1: Basic Info** - with numbered heading \"1. Basic Info\"\n   - Date field with calendar icon showing \"2024-05-23\"\n   - Reference ID field showing \"TRX-20240523-001\"\n   - Description textarea showing \"Q2 Inventory Adjustment for raw materials and finished goods.\"\n   - Transaction Type dropdown showing \"Transfer\"\n   - All fields laid out horizontally in a row\n3. **Section 2: Quantity Transfers** - with numbered heading \"2. Quantity Transfers\"\n   - Table with columns: Source Account, Destination Account, Amount, Source Batch ID (Optional), and delete icon\n   - Two rows of data\n   - Inline add row with: \"+ Add Quantity Transfer\" button, Source Account dropdown, Destination Account dropdown, Amount field, unit dropdown, Source Batch ID field\n4. **Section 3: Batch Allocation** - with numbered heading \"3. Batch Allocation\"\n   - Table with columns: Material, Amount\n\n, and delete icon\n   - Two rows of data\n   - Inline add row with: \"+ Create New Batch\" button, Material dropdown, Amount field with spinner\n5. **Footer**: Copyright \"© 2024 Inventory System App. All rights reserved.\"\n6. **No sidebar/navigation** visible on this page\n\nNow I'm going through each test case to verify it matches the mockup and requirements. I've confirmed the main elements like the \"New Transaction\" heading, Cancel and Post buttons, the three numbered sections with their respective fields and tables, and the footer. Let me continue checking the remaining test entries against what's shown in the mockup. tested\n- Horizontal layout of fields - ✅ tested\n- \"2. Quantity Transfers\" section heading - ✅ tested\n- Transfer table columns (Source Account, Destination Account, Amount, Source Batch ID (Optional)) - ✅ tested\n- Delete/trash icons on each row - ✅ tested\n- \"+ Add Quantity Transfer\" button - ✅ tested\n- Source Account dropdown in add row - ✅ tested\n- Destination Account dropdown in add row - ✅ tested\n- Amount field in add row - ✅ tested\n- Unit dropdown (showing \"unit\") next to amount - ✅ tested\n- Source Batch ID field in add row - ✅ tested\n- \"3.

The visible elements all have corresponding test entries, no substitutions were made, and the clickable elements specify their exact navigation targets or action results - the Post button creates a transaction and navigates to the transaction detail page, while Cancel returns to the transactions list.\n\nI'm also verifying that data mutations are properly tested: posted transactions appear in the listing, account balances update, and batch allocations create new batches as expected. Now I need to verify that button and control appearance is being tested. appearance, not just existence:\n- Post button has \"primary/prominent styling (e.g., filled blue/green background, white text)\" ✅\n- Cancel button has \"secondary/outline styling\" ✅\n- Date picker has calendar icon ✅\n- Transaction Type dropdown has chevron ✅\nAppearance is verified. ✅\n\n**Directive 7**: Completely test modal dialogs:\n- Cancel confirmation dialog is tested ✅\n- \"Confirm\" and \"Stay\" buttons both tested ✅\n- Dialog behavior when confirmed and when stayed is tested ✅\nModal dialog is completely tested. ✅\n\n**Directive 8**: Attachment functionality should support file uploads. → No attachment functionality on this page. N/A.\n\n**Directive 9**: Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format. → No import/upload on this page. N/A.\n\n**Directive 10**: Backend integrations must include setup instructions. → No backend integration configuration on this page. N/A.\n\n**Directive 11**: State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update:\n- \"Posted transaction appears in TransactionsPage listing\" ✅\n- \"Posted transaction updates account balances\" ✅\n- \"Posted transaction with batch allocation creates new batches\" with lineage references ✅\nAll covered. ✅\n\nNo testSpec.md directive violations found for NewTransactionPage. Now I'm moving into subtask 2 to check writeApp.md directives and see if there are any violations in the component implementation itself. visual appearance to mockup.\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items.\n5. In monorepo, add `base = \"apps/...\"` to netlify.toml and pass `--functions ./netlify/functions` explicitly.\n6. Use tagged template literal syntax for neon queries.\n7. Convert empty strings to null for DATE, TIMESTAMP, UUID columns.\n8. Netlify Functions path index: function name at index 2, resource ID at index 3.\n9. Use searchable select/dropdown for entity references, not plain text input for IDs.\n10. No duplicate links in navigation sidebars.\n11. Never use native HTML `<select>` elements - use custom dropdown components.\n12. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons.\n13. Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.\n14. Every page component must include consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`).\n\nNow I'm verifying that the key components follow these guidelines. NewTransactionPage has the proper data-testid attributes and padding classes applied, with ConfirmDialog from shared components and test IDs on all interactive elements like the cancel and post buttons. BasicInfoForm also has the required test IDs on its form container and input fields for date, reference ID, description, and transaction type selection.\n\nFor QuantityTransfersSection, I'm checking that the table structure includes proper test IDs on the table itself, individual transfer rows, and delete buttons, plus the add-row functionality. The source and destination account fields use SearchableSelect components rather than native selects, and the add transfer inputs have their own test IDs along with the add button.\n\nNow moving to BatchAllocationSection, I see it follows the same pattern with test IDs on the section, table, batch rows, delete buttons, and add-row button. The Material field also uses SearchableSelect, and the add batch inputs have appropriate test IDs.\n\nI'm starting to check for directive compliance now, particularly around converting empty strings to null for date fields. The frontend passes data to the backend rather than directly querying the database, so the null conversion directive applies more to backend operations. Still, I notice `source_batch_id` uses `|| undefined` which converts empty strings to undefined—this gets serialized as a missing field in JSON, which is reasonable for a UUID field. Now checking directive 11 about avoiding native HTML select elements—BasicInfoForm correctly uses a custom dropdown for the transaction type field.\n\nLooking at the other sections, QuantityTransfersSection and BatchAllocationSection both use SearchableSelect for their dropdowns, and there are no native select elements anywhere. The page also has the required padding directive applied with `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. For the testid directive, I'm verifying that SearchableSelect properly receives and applies the testId prop that's being passed to it. Looking at the visual appearance against the mockup, I notice the BasicInfoForm is wrapped in a plain div without the `section-card` class, while the other sections use it. The mockup shows all three sections with consistent card/panel styling, so this is likely a visual inconsistency that needs fixing. The directive about matching visual appearance to the mockup could mean the BasicInfoForm needs that card container styling, though it's a borderline case. I should also verify the footer isn't missing and scan the mockup more carefully for other discrepancies—particularly checking what the Amount column actually displays in the Quantity Transfers table. I'm noticing that BasicInfoForm lacks the section-card wrapper that the other two sections have, which creates a visual inconsistency with the mockup. Since the test entries don't explicitly check for this styling detail, I'm hesitant to flag it as a directive violation, but it's worth noting as a potential visual mismatch. Let me continue reviewing the remaining directives to see if there are any other compliance issues.\n\nNow I'm looking at directive 9 about searchable selects for entity references. The Source Batch ID field in QuantityTransfersSection is implemented as a plain text input, but the test spec explicitly describes it as accepting free text. However, since a batch ID is technically a reference to another entity, there's a tension between what the test spec requires and what the directive recommends—the spec allows free text input while the directive would suggest a searchable dropdown instead. the directive clearly states to use searchable select for entity references, and since batches are tracked entities in the system, this is definitely a violation—the component should be using a SearchableSelect instead of a plain text input for the Source Batch ID field. Let me scan through the rest of the code to identify any other directive conflicts.\n\nNow I'm checking the test coverage for NewTransactionPage itself. Looking at the test files, there's no dedicated test file for this page—all the test entries in the documentation are listed but there are no corresponding playwright tests actually implemented. This means the 40+ test cases documented for NewTransactionPage don't have any test code backing them up, which is a significant gap in test implementation rather than a directive violation per se.\n\nFor my actual findings: the testSpec.md directives are all properly formatted with good coverage of mockup elements. In writeApp.md, there's a potential issue with the Source Batch ID field using plain text instead of a searchable select as the directive suggests, though the test spec itself specifies free text input. The BasicInfoForm also appears to be missing the section-card wrapper shown in the mockup. Since there are no actual test files for NewTransactionPage, there's nothing to check for writeTests.md directive violations.\n\nLet me clarify how these subtasks work: I'm checking testSpec.md directives against the test documentation, writeApp.md directives against the actual components, and writeTests.md directives against the test files themselves. If tests don't exist, that subtask simply has no violations to report.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering the Source Batch ID field more carefully. The writeApp.md directive requires searchable dropdowns for entity references in modals, but the mockup shows a plain text input and the spec describes it as optional free text. Since batches are entities in the system, this technically violates the directive—except the spec's optional nature and the possibility that not all materials have batches suggests a free-text field might be intentional here. I need to determine whether this counts as a genuine directive violation or if the optional/flexible nature of the field justifies the plain text approach. The mockup shows a text input for Source Batch ID, which aligns with testSpec.md directive 3 about not substituting easier elements for what's shown. So there's no testSpec violation, but there is a writeApp.md violation since directive 9 requires searchable selects for entity references. The real conflict is between the mockup design and the writeApp.md requirements, not between the test spec and the mockup. For the checks: testSpec.md has no violations, writeApp.md has the Source Batch ID issue, and writeTests.md has nothing to review since no test files exist.\n\nActually, I'm second-guessing myself on the writeApp.md violation. The directive specifically mentions \"modals,\" and NewTransactionPage is a page, not a modal. So technically this might not be a violation of that particular directive, even though the principle of using searchable selects for entity IDs is sound UX practice.\n\nLooking at the actual implementation, the Source Account and Destination Account fields already use SearchableSelect, which is good. The Source Batch ID field doesn't, but that's an inconsistency rather than a directive violation since the directive is scoped to modals.\n\nSo my findings are: no test violations in the test spec, and no directive violations in the components, though there's an inconsistency in how entity references are handled across the form fields. Looking at the parent component structure, I see the three form sections are wrapped in a flex container with gap spacing, but there's no card wrapper around BasicInfoForm itself—only around the other two sections. This confirms the visual inconsistency with the mockup, which shows all three sections with the same card styling.\n\nFor the test files, I'm checking if NewTransactionPage has any existing test coverage, but it appears there are only tests for dashboard and deployment, so I can't evaluate any test-related directive violations.\n\nI've identified one clear violation: BasicInfoForm is missing the card wrapper styling that matches the mockup design. I should report this finding and create a fix task for

Looking at the code: `QuantityTransfersSection` and `BatchAllocationSection` both wrap their content in `<div className=\"section-card\">`, but `BasicInfoForm` does **NOT** use `section-card`. This is a **visual mismatch** with the mockup.\n\n### Checking QuantityTransfersSection.tsx:\n- **Directive: data-testid** - `data-testid=\"quantity-transfers-section\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"quantity-transfers-table\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"transfer-row-${row.id}\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"delete-transfer-${row.id}\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"add-transfer-row\"` ✅, `testId=\"add-transfer-source-account\"` ✅, `testId=\"add-transfer-dest-account\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"add-transfer-amount\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"add-transfer-unit-trigger\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"add-transfer-unit-dropdown\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"add-transfer-source-batch-id\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"add-transfer-button\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"error-transfers\"` ✅\n- **Directive: no native `<select>`** - Uses SearchableSelect for accounts, custom dropdown for unit ✅\n- **Directive: searchable select for entity references** - Source Account uses SearchableSelect ✅, Destination Account uses SearchableSelect ✅. Source Batch ID uses plain text input - but the directive says \"When building **modals** that reference other entities...\" This is a page, not a modal. Technically not a violation, though it would be better UX as a searchable select.\n\n### Checking BatchAllocationSection.tsx:\n- **Directive: data-testid** - `data-testid=\"batch-allocation-section\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"batch-allocation-table\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"batch-row-${row.id}\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"delete-batch-${row.id}\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"add-batch-row\"` ✅, `testId=\"add-batch-material\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"add-batch-amount\"` ✅, `data-testid=\"add-batch-button\"` ✅\n- **Directive: no native `<select>`** - Uses SearchableSelect for materials ✅\n\n### Visual mockup comparison (Directive 3):\nLooking at the mockup carefully, all three sections (Basic Info, Quantity Transfers, Batch Allocation) appear inside card/panel containers with similar borders.
