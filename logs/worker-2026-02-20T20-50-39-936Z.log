Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0846fd35-f535-4988-893d-b7902e73bbc8","uuid":"871d06ea-0af9-4b76-8a12-b214d6abff84","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\"\n   - This is about styling consistency, not directly testable against test entries.\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element**: \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\"\n   - Checking the test entries, I see coverage for PersonHeader elements, the Relationships section with its view toggle and list/graph views, ContactHistorySection with its chronological log and filtering, and AssociatedClientsSection with client cards. However, there's a discrepancy where the spec heading reads \"Relationships with Other Individuals\" but the test entry only references \"Relationships.\"\n   - Looking at the actual component code, the heading is just \"Relationships\" while the spec expects the full \"Relationships with Other Individuals\" text—this appears to be a mismatch between the component implementation and the specification document.\n   - The test entries align well with the mockup descriptions overall, and clickable elements like the associated client link in PDP-HDR-02 correctly specify their navigation targets.\n   - Checking the data mutation tests, I can see persistence is being verified across person edits, relationship additions and deletions, and contact history changes, though I notice PDP-CH-08 appears to be cut off.\n\n6. **Button and control appearance**: \"If a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance.\"\n   - PDP-REL-01 mentions \"Two tabs: Graph View and List View\", Filter button and \"+ Add Entry\" button ✓\n   - PDP-CH-01 mentions \"Filter and '+ Add Entry' buttons\" and \"Edit pencil icon on each entry\" ✓\n   - PDP-AC-01 mentions \"View Client Detail Page\" button ✓\n\n7. **Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**:\n   - PDP-REL-04 & PDP-REL-05: Add relationship modal ✓\n   - PDP-CH-03 & PDP-CH-04: Add contact history modal ✓\n   - Checking the edit modals for contact history...\n\n8. **State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately**: The test spec doesn't explicitly verify that timeline or history entries update when mutations occur, though looking at the actual component, there doesn't appear to be a timeline feature on PersonDetailPage anyway.\n\n9. **Import/upload dialogs**: Not applicable to PersonDetailPage.\n\n10. **Backend integrations**: Not applicable to PersonDetailPage.\n\nNow I'm looking more closely at the heading text discrepancy—the test entry PDP-REL-01 specifies \"Relationships with Other Individuals\" but the component just renders \"Relationships\" as the heading.\n\nThe test spec itself is internally consistent, with the RelationshipsSection component documented as having that full heading text. So this is actually a mismatch between what the component implements and what the test spec expects—the component needs to be corrected to match the spec.\n\nMoving on to the ContactHistorySection, I'm checking the component listing against test entry PDP-CH-01. The spec calls for \"History of Contact\" as the heading with a clock icon, filter and add entry buttons, and each row showing date/time, interaction type, summary, team member attribution, and an edit pencil icon. The component listing matches all of this. ✓\n\nNow I need to examine the PersonHeader more carefully to see if it aligns with what the test spec expects. I'm noticing a gap in the test coverage — none of the modal test entries actually verify that the Cancel button works correctly and discards changes. The directive explicitly asks to \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly,\" which should include testing the Cancel functionality on the relationship, chapter, and acknowledgment modals, not just the open, fill, and save flows. I'm noticing the RelationshipsSection heading text doesn't match the spec—it renders \"Relationships\" instead of \"Relationships with Other Individuals\"—but that's a component implementation issue, not a test spec violation. Looking more carefully at the testSpec directives, particularly around data mutations and side effects, I need to identify whether the test entries actually verify persistence and the exact consequences of user actions rather than just checking that UI elements exist. I'm finding that the main testSpec.md violations in PersonDetailPage are relatively minor. The modals (AddRelationshipModal, AddContactHistoryModal, EditContactHistoryModal) all have Cancel and close buttons, but there's no explicit test verifying that clicking Cancel actually closes the modal and discards changes—the test entries only confirm the buttons exist. This feels like a small gap since the modals are being tested for their core add/edit/save functionality, and the Cancel behavior is fairly straightforward. need to verify another requirement about clickable elements — they must specify exact navigation targets or action results, not leave destinations ambiguous. Looking at PDP-REL-07, the graph view nodes are clickable and navigate to individual profiles, but the test entry only describes the visual appearance without mentioning the navigation behavior, which seems like it might violate that directive.\n\nNow I'm compiling the violations I've found across the PersonDetailPage test entries: the modals are missing Cancel button tests, and PDP-REL-07 doesn't verify that clicking graph nodes actually navigates anywhere. The directive about clickable elements applies to what's actually in the implementation, not just what's explicitly shown in the mockup. The graph nodes have click handlers and pointer cursors, so they're legitimate clickable elements that should be tested. Beyond that, I'm seeing a couple of clear gaps: the graph view nodes themselves aren't covered, and modal cancel button behavior isn't fully tested. Let me check if there are other similar issues in the product detail pages—I notice the associated clients section mentions clickable links that might not be accounted for in the test entries. I'm realizing the directive about clickable elements is specifically about test entries that mention them—ensuring they specify exact targets, not that every possible clickable element needs its own entry. The broader inventory directive does say to document every visible element, so if the breadcrumb appears in the mockup, it should have a test entry, but without seeing the actual mockup I can't confirm whether it's supposed to be there.\n\nLooking at the test spec more carefully, I don't see any clear violations—the entries are fairly comprehensive for what they cover. There are some potential gaps like modal cancel behavior and graph interactions, but those are debatable. Let me shift focus to checking the PersonDetailPage components against the writeApp.md directives, starting with whether the app code actually satisfies the test entry requirements.\n\nI'll also need to verify that all interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes, check visual consistency with the mockup for button variants and layouts, and flag any backend-specific directives like the neon driver syntax and null conversion rules for later review. Checking all the components for native `<select>` elements—PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, and ContactHistorySection all use custom dropdown implementations instead, and the modals use FilterSelect components, so that guideline is satisfied. Now I'm verifying the test requirements against the actual component implementations, starting with PersonHeader which should display the individual's name prominently, their title and associated companies below, and contact information with appropriate icons.\n\nMoving to the RelationshipsSection, the test spec expects a heading that reads \"Relationships with Other Individuals\" but the component only renders \"Relationships\"—that's a mismatch I need to flag. The relationship entries themselves appear to show the person name and relationship type correctly.\n\nFor the add relationship modal, the spec calls for the ability to either search existing individuals or create a new one, but the current implementation only supports searching existing people. That's a gap I should note as a potential violation since the \"create new\" functionality seems to be missing.\n\nLooking at PDP-REL-07, the graph view does render a center node representing the user with connected nodes showing names and relationship types, which matches the requirement. I need to check if there are any other details about the center node that might not align with the spec.\n\nFor the contact history and associated clients sections, those appear to be rendering correctly with all the required elements like the clock icon, date/time information, and client cards with their respective details.\n\nNow I'm checking the data-testid attributes across all components to ensure E2E tests can properly target everything they need. Looking at PersonHeader.tsx, I can see it has test IDs for the main container, edit form, buttons, and input fields for name, title, and email.\n\nContinuing through the rest of PersonHeader, the phone, location, and display sections all have their test IDs in place, along with the associated clients section and individual client links. RelationshipsSection.tsx is also properly set up with test IDs for the container, filter button, and dropdown.\n\nNow I'm verifying the remaining test IDs for the relationships section—the filter options, add entry button, view toggle between graph and list modes, the list view container with its empty state and individual relationship items, and the graph view container.\n\nMoving on to the ContactHistorySection, I need to check all the test IDs there as well—the filter button and dropdown with their options, the add entry button, empty state, and then each history entry with its associated date, type, and summary fields. Continuing through the AddRelationshipModal and AddContactHistoryModal components, verifying all the test IDs are properly set up for the modals, form inputs, and action buttons.\n\nNow I need to check the writeApp.md guidelines about state management, particularly around syncing props with useState.\n\nLooking at PersonHeader.tsx, I see it's initializing state with prop values like `useState(individual.name)`, but there's no useEffect to keep that state in sync when the prop changes. When the parent reloads data after a save, the individual prop updates but the local state doesn't reinitialize. The cancel handler does reset to the current prop values, but that's not enough to handle prop changes from external updates. because it reads from the prop.\n\nActually, when the prop changes after save, the component re-renders. The `useState` hooks keep their old values. But since `editing` is false, the component shows the `individual` prop values (display mode), not the local state. The local state is only used in edit mode.\n\nWhen the user clicks edit again, the local state has stale values. Is there a `useEffect` to sync? No! So if you:\n1. Open edit mode → local state is initialized from prop on first render\n2. Edit phone → local state updated\n3. Click save → save returns, editing=false, parent refetches, individual prop updates\n4. Open edit mode again → local state still has the OLD initial values from step 1 (not the new prop values)\n\nWait, actually... `handleCancel` sets state back to prop values. But there's no similar reset when entering edit mode. When `setEditing(true)` is called, the local state still has whatever values were set last. On first render, `name` gets initialized from the prop. After saving, `handleSave` updates the parent and sets `editing` to false, so the display shows the updated prop value. But the `name` state variable still holds the edited value from before the save. When edit mode opens again, that stale state is still there instead of the refreshed prop value.\n\nThe real issue is that if the prop changes for any reason—whether from a save, a refetch, or someone else updating the data—the local state doesn't sync. The component should use `useEffect` to reset the local state whenever the prop changes, especially when entering edit mode.\n\nLooking at the directives in writeApp.md, I see the heading mismatch is a clear violation: the test spec expects \"Relationships with Other Individuals\" but the component renders just \"Relationships\". I need to check if there are other directive violations in the PersonDetailPage components. Looking at the PersonHeader component, I see that `handleSave` calls `onUpdate` without awaiting it, then immediately sets editing to false—but since `onUpdate` is async and performs a fetch, the edit mode closes before the save actually completes. The writeApp.md guidance suggests awaiting the Promise before closing edit mode, though it's presented as a tip rather than a requirement.\n\nI also notice the AddRelationshipModal is missing the ability to create a new person—it only lets you search and select from existing individuals, but PDP-REL-04 specifies it should support both selecting existing people and creating new ones. Directive: \"When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\"\n\n4. **PersonHeader onUpdate not returning Promise**: Looking at PersonHeader.tsx, the `onUpdate` prop is typed as `(data: ...) => void`, but in PersonDetailPage.tsx, `handleUpdatePerson` is async. The handleSave function calls onUpdate without awaiting it, then immediately sets editing to false, which closes the UI before the save is confirmed.\n\nNow I need to focus on actual Directives rather than Tips. Let me check the component layout requirements: PersonHeader has padding and margin on its root element (`p-5` and `mb-4`), but I'm seeing this is listed as a Tip, not a Directive. Let me look at what the actual Directives section says in writeApp.md. I'm realizing the layout-agnostic guideline is actually a tip, not a directive. Looking at just the directives for this job, I can see the RelationshipsSection has a heading mismatch and the AddRelationshipModal is missing the ability to create new people—it only searches existing ones. The data-testid attributes and select element usage look correct though. I need to clarify whether the backend I'm checking is actually part of this job or if I'm looking at the wrong one.\n\nLet me review the backend directives from writeApp.md anyway. The neon serverless driver is being used correctly with tagged template literals throughout, and the date handling in both the POST and PUT contact-history handlers properly converts empty strings to null using the `||` operator.\n\nLooking at the PUT individual handler, I notice it uses `??` instead of `||` for fields like name, title, email, phone, and location. But since these are text columns rather than DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID types, the directive about empty string conversion doesn't actually apply here — the `??` vs `||` distinction only matters for the specific column types mentioned in the guidelines.\n\nFor the path parsing in individuals.ts, I'm verifying that the resource IDs are being extracted correctly. The pathParts array after splitting and filtering gives us the function name at index 2 and the resource ID at index 3, which checks out. For sub-resources like relationships, those land at indices 4 and 5 as expected. The backend routing logic looks solid.\n\nNow moving into Job 2, I'm finding some clear spec violations in the CheckComponentsPersonDetailPage. The RelationshipsSection heading needs to say \"Relationships with Other Individuals\" instead of just \"Relationships\" to match PDP-REL-01. More importantly, the AddRelationshipModal is missing functionality—it only lets you search for existing people, but the spec explicitly requires both searching existing individuals AND creating new ones. That's a definite violation of PDP-REL-04.\n\nFor Job 3, I'm about to check the PersonDetailPage tests against the writeTests.md directives.\n\nLooking at the navigation verification directive first—the tests are properly asserting URLs after clicks with regex patterns for PDP-HDR-02, PDP-REL-03, and PDP-AC-02. For side effects, PDP-REL-05 correctly verifies the count increases by exactly 1 and confirms the API call happened.\n\nNow checking the remaining side effect tests—PDP-CH-04, PDP-REL-08, and PDP-CH-08 all verify count changes persist after reload, which covers both the primary effect and persistence. Moving to the getByText guideline, I'm scanning for problematic usage with common words. PDP-REL-04 uses getByText with \"Person *\" and \"Relationship Type *\" scoped to the modal, and while the asterisk adds specificity, substring matching could still be an issue. PDP-CH-03 also has getByText calls that need checking.\n\nFor the data-testid consistency requirement, I need to verify that testids like `person-header-*`, `relationships-*`, and `contact-history-*` are used consistently across all test files referencing PersonDetailPage components.\n\nFile uploads aren't relevant here. I don't see any `.toPass()` retry blocks in the test file, which is good. For the field interaction requirement, the tests properly exercise the exact fields mentioned in the specs — changing phone numbers and summary text before saving, which matches what's specified.\n\nNow checking the parallel test design rules. The tests that add or remove records use relative counts rather than fixed totals, so they won't break if other tests run in parallel. PDP-REL-05 captures the count before adding an item and verifies it increased by one, while PDP-REL-08 does the same for deletion.\n\nThe tests also discover IDs dynamically from the UI instead of hardcoding them, which is good practice. I should verify the Playwright config has parallel execution enabled, though that's not specific to PersonDetailPage tests.\n\nLooking at the filter test in PDP-REL-06, I'm extracting the first item's type text and normalizing it...\n\nExamining filter logic...\n\nThe filter test is reverse-engineering internal filter values from the display text by stripping parentheses, lowercasing, and replacing spaces with underscores—it's a bit fragile but not a directive violation. I'm noticing the loop that iterates over filtered items with await calls isn't wrapped in a `.toPass()` block, so it doesn't violate the auto-wait directive, though it does rely on sequential DOM queries.\n\nLet me double-check the directive again: it specifically prohibits auto-wait calls inside `.toPass()` retry blocks when iterating over dynamic elements. Since these filter tests don't use `.toPass()` at all, they're clear. The PDP-CH-07 test follows the same pattern and should be fine too. Now I'm looking through the writeTests directory to see if there are other potential issues.\n\nI'm checking the getByText() usage against the directive about avoiding common words. Most of the modal selectors like \"Person *\", \"Relationship Type *\", and \"Date/Time *\" are scoped and specific enough, though \"Type *\" is pretty generic—but within the modal's limited context it should work.\n\nThe bigger issue is that labels lack data-testid attributes, which the directive requires for elements E2E tests need to target. However, since labels aren't interactive, using getByText as a fallback is acceptable per the guidelines. Now I'm looking at the delete tests for PDP-REL-08 and PDP-CH-08 to see if they're properly verifying the item count decreases.\n\nThere's a potential problem though: both tests delete the last item and verify persistence through reload, but PDP-REL-08 might be deleting an orphaned relationship created by PDP-REL-05 if that test's cleanup failed. Since tests share a worker within the same spec file, this could cause PDP-REL-08 to delete the wrong item. Looking at PDP-REL-05's cleanup logic, it attempts to find and click the delete button on the newly created item...\n\nStill examining cleanup code...\n\nThe cleanup catches errors, so if it fails silently, PDP-REL-08 could end up deleting a test-created relationship instead of seed data. However, since PDP-REL-08 uses relative count verification, it would still pass even if it deleted the wrong item—it just verifies the count decreased by one. This is a data integrity concern but doesn't violate the test directives. Now I need to revisit the `getByText` issue to see if that's a clearer violation. The scoped `getByText` calls in these modals are actually fine since they're limited to specific modal contexts, which reduces ambiguity. Looking deeper, I notice the filter tests use `textContent()` parsing which is fragile but doesn't violate the directive. I'm also verifying that field interaction tests like PDP-HDR-04 actually exercise the specific fields mentioned in the spec—this one correctly changes the phone number and validates the save.\n\nChecking the other field interaction tests, PDP-CH-04 fills all the required fields including the summary, though it uses \"Discussed pricing options for Q4\" instead of just \"Discussed pricing options\"—a minor text variation but the right field is still being exercised. PDP-CH-06 correctly changes the summary as specified. Now I'm comparing test titles against their corresponding spec entries to ensure alignment. The relationships section also supports a graph view for visual representation, and users can delete relationships. The contact history section tracks interactions chronologically with full CRUD operations—adding, editing, filtering by type, and removing entries. There's also an associated clients section displaying client cards. I'm continuing through the test cases and noticing a mismatch in the contact history section—the spec describes a chronological log, but the test title mentions section controls instead. Moving through the remaining relationship and contact history tests, most are passing, though the list appears to be cut off partway through. I see the real problem now—PDP-CH-01's test doesn't actually verify the chronological log itself, just that the section and controls exist. The spec clearly expects the test to confirm that entry details like date/time, interaction type, summary, and team member are visible, along with the edit icon. PDP-CH-02 covers those details, but PDP-CH-01 should too, since that's what the test entry requires.\n\nThere's also an issue with PDP-HDR-02's test—it wraps the main assertion in a visibility check that silently passes if the associated clients section isn't visible. This means a broken component could slip through undetected, even though the test entry assumes the section is present. The test should navigate to a specific person known to have associated clients rather than relying on whatever record happens to load.\n\nLooking at the directive about verifying navigation targets precisely, the test does check the URL after clicking, but only if the visibility condition is met. If the assertion never runs, the test isn't actually testing anything. I'm seeing the same pattern repeated across several other tests—PDP-REL-03, PDP-CH-05, PDP-CH-06, and PDP-CH-07 all have conditional guards that let them pass without asserting when data isn't present.\n\nThe core issue is whether a test that silently passes without running its assertions violates the directive to verify user-expected behavior. The writeTests directive says tests should verify the app behaves as expected, but if the main assertions are skipped, nothing's actually being verified.\n\nThe Parallel Test Design section suggests a better approach: tests should create their own data in setup/teardown rather than relying on the global seed data staying intact. This would make the tests more robust and ensure they always run their assertions.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking each directive from testSpec.md against the PersonDetailPage test entries. The first few directives about visual consistency and inventorying visible elements appear to be covered comprehensively, but I need to continue evaluating whether the tests are substituting easier approaches where they shouldn't.\n\nFor clickable elements, I'm noticing that the Graph View nodes are interactive but the test entry doesn't specify their navigation targets—I should flag this as potentially missing the required specificity. The data mutation tests look solid with persistence verification, and button styling is documented. I'm still working through the modal dialog requirements.\n\nLooking at the modals more carefully, AddRelationshipModal has coverage through the open and save tests, but I need to check if AddContactHistoryModal is fully tested as well. The Cancel action isn't explicitly tested, though that might be acceptable depending on the testing standards. Most of the other checklist items don't apply to this component, and the state-changing actions appear to have adequate persistence testing without cross-component side effects to worry about. Overall, the test spec seems largely compliant with only that graph node interaction as a potential gap.\n\nActually, I'm noticing something important now. The modals do have Save/Cancel buttons documented, but the tests only verify their existence, not their actual functionality. The directive asks to \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly,\" and that should include verifying that Cancel actually closes the modal and that the X button works too. This looks like a real gap in coverage. The test entries for modals mention the buttons exist, but they don't verify what happens when you click Cancel—there's no test confirming the modal closes without saving. I'll add that as a missing test entry violation. Now I'm determining which fix groups to create based on these violations across the three jobs.\n\nI should group related fixes by root cause: the RelationshipsSection heading needs a text update in the component, test, and docs; the AddRelationshipModal missing \"create new\" option is more involved since it might require backend changes; the PDP-CH-01 test has a title and content mismatch that needs fixing; and the modal Cancel tests need new test spec entries. Actually, reconsidering the modal Cancel tests—the existing tests do verify opening and saving, so Cancel behavior might be implied rather than a true gap.\n\nLet me focus on the clearest violations: the RelationshipsSection heading text mismatch and the PDP-CH-01 test issues. For the AddRelationshipModal, I need to check if \"create new\" means the ability to search for existing people or actually create new ones within the modal—the spec says users should be able to either search for existing or create new, but the current implementation only searches.\n\nLooking at the modal behavior, when a name doesn't match any existing person, it just shows \"No individuals found\" with no option to create a new one. That's a real gap against the spec requirements.\n\nSo I'm grouping these as three separate fixes: the heading text, the test title and content, and adding the create new functionality to the modal. The first two are straightforward text corrections in different files, while the third is a more substantial feature addition. Fix Group 3 is more complex than I initially thought—it requires both component updates and potentially backend changes to support creating new individuals. The spec clearly states \"select/search existing or create new,\" which the current component doesn't support. This could be implemented as a combobox with free text entry or a dedicated \"Create new\" button, but either way it's a substantial feature addition that belongs in its own fix group. Let me verify this is actually a violation by re-reading the requirements. Looking at the test entries more carefully, PDP-REL-05 only tests selecting an existing person, not creating a new one through the modal. The \"create new\" capability mentioned in PDP-REL-04 isn't actually covered by any test case, which means there's a gap between what the spec describes and what's being validated. I should flag this as both a testSpec.md issue (missing test for the create new path) and a writeApp.md issue (component needs to support it).\n\nNow I'm organizing my findings and determining which violations warrant fix groups. The strategy requires me to announce what I'm checking, report any directive violations, and create fix groups accordingly. Looking at the test entries themselves, they seem to comprehensively cover the PersonDetailPage components without clear directive violations, but the missing \"create new\" test is definitely a gap I need to address. Looking at the close button on modals—there's no test entry that verifies the X button functionality, which seems like a gap given the directive to inventory every button. But I don't want to be overly pedantic about this. Let me wrap up my findings.\n\n**Job 1**: No violations detected.\n\n**Job 2**: Two issues in the components—the RelationshipsSection heading needs to match the spec exactly, and the AddRelationshipModal is missing the ability to create new people as specified.\n\n**Job 3**: Test title mismatches in the Contact History tests where the wording doesn't align with what the spec describes.\n\nI just caught something in PersonHeader.tsx—the `handleSave` function calls an async `onUpdate` without awaiting it, so edit mode closes before the save actually completes. The writeApp.md tips section specifically recommends awaiting async operations before changing UI state, though this is guidance rather than a hard requirement.\n\nNow I'm checking the backend's null-handling for database columns. The text columns in the PUT handler correctly use the nullish coalescing operator, and the contact history date columns properly use the logical OR operator for null conversion. But I notice the contact history update is also using nullish coalescing for the team_member field—I need to verify what type that column is and whether the operator choice is correct.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the test coverage for Job 1. The PDP-REL-04 entry describes a \"create new\" capability within the modal, but I don't see that specific interaction tested anywhere else. The directive requires every interactive element to be tested, so if the component supports creating a new person, that action needs its own test case. I'm identifying the specific violations across the three documents. For testSpec.md, PDP-REL-04 describes the \"create new\" person capability in the relationship modal, but there's no corresponding test entry that exercises this interactive element—that's a clear directive violation. For writeApp.md, the RelationshipsSection heading needs to be more descriptive, and the AddRelationshipModal is missing the \"create new\" functionality entirely. For writeTests.md, there are two issues with PDP-CH-01: the test title doesn't match what the spec actually describes, and the test content itself is incomplete against the spec requirements. Now I'm grouping these fixes by component to tackle them systematically. I'm realizing Group C is actually more substantial than I initially thought. The test spec entry PDP-REL-04 describes \"person (select/search existing or create new)\" which suggests the relationship modal needs a \"+ Create new person\" option—a common pattern in CRM interfaces where users can either select from existing people or create one on the fly. This is a real feature gap worth including in the fix groups, so I'll keep it as a distinct task alongside the other

Let me group related fixes:\n\n1. **RelationshipsSection heading** — simple fix, same-root-cause group\n2. **PDP-CH-01 test title and content** — test file fix\n3. **AddRelationshipModal \"create new\" + test entry gap** — shared root cause (feature described but not implemented or tested)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1443,"cache_read_input_tokens":96354,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1443,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0846fd35-f535-4988-893d-b7902e73bbc8","uuid":"b233690f-0dd6-4155-8751-8d523750df67"}
