You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array.

Let me analyze each one and write the analysis files. Let me summarize what happened in each log:\n\n1. **Log 44**: Deployment task (Unpack: Deploy to production). Agent started reading files and checking apps, but hit API Error 500. Retry 2/3. No test failures.\n\n2. **Log 45**: Deployment task (Unpack: Deploy to production). Agent started reading files and checking apps/tasks, but hit API Error 500. Task failed 3 times, skipped. No test failures.\n\n3. **Log 46**: Fix bug report task (Unpack: Fix open bug reports). \n\n4. **Log 47**: Review bug report task (Unpack: Review fixed bug reports). Agent searched for bugReports.md files, found none, signaled DONE. No test failures.\n\n5. **Log 48**: Check directives task (Unpack: Check directive compliance) for ProductionHub. Agent read skill files, explored apps/tasks, but hit API Error 500. Retry 1/3. No test failures.\n\n6. **Log 49**: Check directives task (Unpack: Check directive compliance). Hit API Error 500 immediately, only one retry attempt recorded. No test failures.\n\n7. **Log 5**: Polish app task (Unpack: Polish app quality) for Accounting. Agent read skill files, created docs/plan.md, added 7 MakeResponsive tasks, signaled DONE. No test failures.\n\n8. **Log 50**: Check directives task (Unpack: Check directive compliance). Agent read skill files, started exploring, hit API Error 500. Task failed 3 times, skipped. No test failures.\n\n9. **Log 51**: Polish app task (Unpack: Polish app quality) for ProductionHub. Agent read skill files, explored apps/tasks, but hit API Error 500. Retry 1/3. No test failures.\n\n10. **Log 52**: Polish app task (Unpack: Polish app quality) for ProductionHub continuing with retries after API errors.\n\nLooking at the pattern across all these logs, the failures are consistently infrastructure-related—API Error 500s causing retries—rather than actual test failures. Now I'm ready to write up the analysis.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3994,"cache_read_input_tokens":34047,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3994,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f06d510f-9263-4076-9740-53b04e4acc33","uuid":"40cb739d-a92e-4f01-b610-bba7bbe98349"}
