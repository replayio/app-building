Sign-up requires email confirmation before login (in production; auto-confirmed in test mode).\n- **ForgotPasswordPage**: Page at /auth/forgot-password with a form to enter email and request a password reset link.\n- **ResetPasswordPage**: Page at /auth/reset-password?token=... with a form to enter a new password.\n- **ConfirmEmailPage**: Page at /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms a user's email and signs them in.\n\n### Test Entries\n\n#### SidebarUserArea\n\n**AUTH-USR-01: Sidebar displays authenticated user info in upper left**\n- Initial: User is authenticated and on any page\n- Action: Observe the sidebar user area\n- Expected: The sidebar shows the user area (data-testid=\"sidebar-user-area\") below the app title containing the authenticated user's name (data-testid=\"sidebar-user-name\"), avatar or initial (data-testid=\"sidebar-user-avatar\"), and a sign-out button (data-testid=\"sidebar-sign-out\").\n\n**AUTH-USR-02: Sidebar displays sign-in button when not logged in**\n- Initial: User is not authenticated and on any page\n- Action: Observe the sidebar user area\n- Expected: The sidebar shows the user area (data-testid=\"sidebar-user-area\") below the app title containing a \"Sign in\" button (data-testid=\"sidebar-sign-in\"). Clicking it reveals an email/password form (data-testid=\"sidebar-auth-form\") with email input (data-testid=\"auth-email-input\"), password input (data-testid=\"auth-password-input\"), submit button (data-testid=\"auth-submit-button\"), a \"Forgot password?\" link (data-testid=\"auth-forgot-password\"), and a toggle to switch between sign-in and sign-up modes (data-testid=\"auth-toggle-mode\").\n\n**AUTH-USR-03: App loads without authentication**\n- Initial: User is not authenticated\n- Action: Navigate to /clients\n- Expected: The clients page loads and displays data without requiring login. The sidebar is visible with navigation links and the sign-in button.\n\n**AUTH-E2E-01: Full signup and login flow works end-to-end**\n- Initial: User is not authenticated\n- Action: Click \"Sign in\", toggle to sign-up mode, enter a new email/password, submit. Then sign out. Then sign back in with the same credentials.\n- Expected: After signup, user is immediately logged in (user name and avatar visible, sign-out button visible). After signing out, the sign-in button reappears. After signing in with the same credentials, user is logged in again with name and sign-out visible. (Note: in test mode, email confirmation is auto-completed.)\n\n#### ForgotPasswordPage\n\n**AUTH-FP-01: Forgot password link navigates to forgot password page**\n- Initial: User is not authenticated and on /clients\n- Action: Click \"Sign in\", then click \"Forgot password?\" link (data-testid=\"auth-forgot-password\")\n- Expected: App navigates to /auth/forgot-password. The forgot password page (data-testid=\"forgot-password-page\") displays a form (data-testid=\"forgot-password-form\") with an email input (data-testid=\"forgot-password-email\"), a submit button (data-testid=\"forgot-password-submit\"), and a \"Back to sign in\" link (data-testid=\"forgot-password-back-to-signin\") that navigates to /clients.\n\n**AUTH-FP-02: Forgot password form submits and shows success message**\n- Initial: User is on /auth/forgot-password\n- Action: Enter an email address and click \"Send Reset Link\"\n- Expected: After submission, a success message appears (data-testid=\"forgot-password-success\") with text indicating to check email, and a \"Back to app\" button (data-testid=\"forgot-password-back\") that navigates to /clients.\n\n#### ResetPasswordPage\n\n**AUTH-RP-01: Reset password page shows form with valid token**\n- Initial: User navigates to /auth/reset-password?token=validtoken\n- Action: Observe the page\n- Expected: The reset password page (data-testid=\"reset-password-page\") shows a form (data-testid=\"reset-password-form\") with new password input (data-testid=\"reset-password-input\"), confirm password input (data-testid=\"reset-password-confirm-input\"), and a submit button (data-testid=\"reset-password-submit\").\n\n**AUTH-RP-02: Reset password page shows error without token**\n- Initial: User navigates to /auth/reset-password (no token)\n- Action: Observe the page\n- Expected: The page (data-testid=\"reset-password-page\") shows an error (data-testid=\"reset-password-error\") with \"No reset token provided\" message and a \"Go to app\" button (data-testid=\"reset-password-go-to-app\") that navigates to /clients.\n\n**AUTH-RP-03: Reset password form submission and verification**\n- Initial: User navigates to /auth/reset-password?token=sometoken\n- Action: Enter a new password and confirmation, then click \"Reset Password\"\n- Expected: The form validates that password is at least 6 characters and that both password fields match. If validation fails, an error message appears (data-testid=\"reset-password-error\"). If passwords do not match, the error text contains \"Passwords do not match\". If password is too short, the error text contains \"Password must be at least 6 characters\".\n\n#### ConfirmEmailPage\n\n**AUTH-CE-01: Confirm email page shows error without token**\n- Initial: User navigates to /auth/confirm-email (no token)\n- Action: Observe the page\n- Expected: The page (data-testid=\"confirm-email-page\") shows an error (data-testid=\"confirm-email-error\") with \"No confirmation token provided\" message and a \"Go to app\" button (data-testid=\"confirm-email-go-to-app\") that navigates to /clients.\n\n**AUTH-CE-02: Successful email confirmation flow**\n- Initial: User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=sometoken\n- Action: Wait for the confirmation process to complete\n- Expected: The page (data-testid=\"confirm-email-page\") initially shows a loading state (data-testid=\"confirm-email-loading\") with \"Confirming your email...\" text. After processing, either a success state (data-testid=\"confirm-email-success\") with \"Email Confirmed\" heading appears, or an error state (data-testid=\"confirm-email-error\") with \"Confirmation Failed\" heading appears if the token is invalid.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   193→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   194→```\n   195→\n   196→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   197→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   198→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   199→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   200→\n   201→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   202→\n   203→## Directives\n   204→\n   205→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   211→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   212→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   213→\n   214→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   215→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   216→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   217→\n   218→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   219→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   220→\n   221→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   222→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   223→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   224→\n   225→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   226→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   227→\n   228→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   229→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   230→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   231→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   232→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   233→\n   234→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   235→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   236→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   237→\n   238→## Tips\n   239→\n   240→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   241→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   242→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   243→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   244→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   245→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   246→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   247→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   248→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   249→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   250→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   251→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   252→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   253→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   254→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   255→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   256→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   257→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   258→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   259→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   260→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   261→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   262→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   263→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   264→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   265→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   266→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   267→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   268→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them).

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":281,"startLine":1,"totalLines":281}}}

Main Contacts List Page\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ContactsListPage.tsx`\n- **data-testid:** `contacts-list-page`\n- **Key behavior:** Main container for the entire contacts page, manages all state for contacts, search, pagination, and modals\n\n### 2. Contacts Page Header\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/contacts/ContactsPageHeader.tsx`\n- **data-testid:** `contacts-page-header`\n- **Sub-components:**\n  - Import Button: `contacts-import-button` (triggers import dialog)\n  - Export Button: `contacts-export-button` (exports contacts as CSV)\n  - Add Contact Button: `add-new-contact-button` (opens AddContactModal)\n\n### 3. Import Dialog\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/ImportDialog.tsx`\n- **Main container:** `import-dialog`\n- **Sub-components:**\n  - CSV Format Info Section: `csv-format-info`\n  - Download Template Button: `download-template-button` (downloads CSV template)\n  - File Input: `csv-file-input` (accepts .csv files)\n  - Import Result Display: `import-result` (shows success/error messages)\n  - Cancel/Close Button: `import-cancel-button` (text changes from \"Cancel\" to \"Close\" based on result state)\n  - Import Submit Button: `import-submit-button` (disabled until file is selected; shows \"Importing...\" while importing)\n\n**Import behavior:**\n- Parses CSV file and maps columns using the provided `headerMap`\n- Shows import results with count of successful imports and any errors\n- Calls `onImported()` callback if any items were successfully imported\n- Cancel button text toggles between \"Cancel\" (before import) and \"Close\" (after import)\n\n### 4. Export Functionality\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ContactsListPage.tsx` (handleExport function, lines 61-79)\n- **Export behavior:**\n  - Generates CSV with headers: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Associated Clients\n  - Creates blob and triggers download as `contacts-export.csv`\n  - No dedicated modal/dialog - direct download via button click\n\n### 5. Pagination Component\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/contacts/ContactsPagination.tsx`\n- **Main container:** `contacts-pagination`\n- **Sub-components:**\n  - Pagination Info: `contacts-pagination-info` (displays \"Showing X-Y of Z contacts\")\n  - Previous Button: `contacts-pagination-previous` (disabled when page <= 1)\n  - Page Buttons: `contacts-pagination-page-${pageNumber}` (e.g., `contacts-pagination-page-1`, `contacts-pagination-page-2`)\n  - Next Button: `contacts-pagination-next` (disabled when page >= totalPages)\n\n**Pagination behavior:**\n- Shows \"Showing X-Y of Z contacts\" format\n- Current page button highlighted with accent color\n- Previous/Next buttons disabled at boundaries\n- Smart pagination display (shows 1, ..., current±1, ..., last for large page counts)\n\n### 6. Add Contact Modal\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/contacts/AddContactModal.tsx`\n- **Main container:** `add-contact-modal`\n- **Form fields:**\n  - Name Input: `contact-name-input` (required, validates for non-empty)\n  - Title Input: `contact-title-input`\n  - Email Input: `contact-email-input`\n  - Phone Input: `contact-phone-input`\n  - Location Input: `contact-location-input`\n- **Close Button:** `add-contact-modal-close` (X button in header)\n- **Cancel Button:** `contact-cancel-button` (calls onClose)\n- **Save Button:** `contact-save-button` (disabled until name field has text)\n\n**Modal behavior:**\n- All fields auto-trim on save\n- Save button disabled when name is empty\n- Cancel/X button closes without saving\n- Modal unmounts completely when not open (conditional rendering with `if (!open) return null`)\n\n### 7. Contacts Table\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/contacts/ContactsTable.tsx`\n- **Main container:** `contacts-table`\n- **Table header:** `contacts-table-header`\n- **Empty state:** `contacts-empty` (when no contacts found)\n- **Row elements:** `contact-row-${contact.id}` (clickable rows)\n- **Cell elements per row:**\n  - `contact-name` (navigates to `/individuals/${contact.id}` on click)\n  - `contact-title`\n  - `contact-email`\n  - `contact-phone`\n  - `contact-location`\n  - `contact-clients` (shows associated client badges)\n\n### 8. Contacts Search Bar\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/contacts/ContactsSearchBar.tsx`\n- **Main container:** `contacts-search-bar`\n- **Input field:** `contacts-search-input` (debounced 300ms)\n- **Clear button:** `contacts-search-clear` (only visible when input has value)\n- **Search behavior:** Searches across name, email, title, and location fields\n\nAll components properly implement data-testids for comprehensive test coverage and automation."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: af8220d (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 27633\ntool_uses: 9\nduration_ms: 19738</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"afa6a3e8-0971-43b8-bd9a-70bdcff8b5e0","uuid":"cfc41cbc-d9c4-45e0-bbc9-0cf397c73481","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Search the /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src directory for ContactsListPage or contacts-related components.

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent.
