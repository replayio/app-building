This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   185→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   186→\n   187→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   188→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   189→\n   190→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   191→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   192→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   193→\n   194→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   195→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   196→\n   197→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   198→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   199→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   200→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   201→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   202→\n   203→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   204→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   205→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   206→\n   207→## Tips\n   208→\n   209→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   210→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   211→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   212→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   213→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   214→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   215→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   216→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   217→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   218→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   219→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   220→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   221→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   222→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   223→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   224→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   225→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   226→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   227→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   228→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   229→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   230→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   231→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   232→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   233→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   234→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   235→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   236→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   237→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   238→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   239→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   240→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   241→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   242→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   243→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   244→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":250,"startLine":1,"totalLines":250}}}

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the attachment data flow. Let me create a summary document with all the findings.\n\n## Attachment Data Flow Summary\n\nI've found the complete attachment system in the SalesCRM app. Here's the full data flow:\n\n### 1. **Modal Component** - Data Entry Point\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddAttachmentModal.tsx`\n\nThe modal handles two types of attachments:\n- **File Upload**: Creates a blob URL via `URL.createObjectURL(file)`\n- **Link URL**: Accepts a URL with optional display name\n\nThe modal emits an `onSave` callback with this structure:\n```typescript\n{\n  filename: string\n  type: 'document' | 'link'\n  url: string\n  size: number | null\n  deal_id: string  // Optional associated deal\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Parent Component** - Modal Orchestration\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientDetailPage.tsx`\n\nThe `ClientDetailPage` component:\n- Manages modal open/close state (`addAttachmentOpen`)\n- Loads attachments on component mount via `loadClientData()` \n- Passes the `handleAddAttachment` function to the modal via `onSave` prop\n- Handles deletion via `handleDeleteAttachment`\n\nThe attachment handler function:\n```typescript\nasync function handleAddAttachment(data: {\n  filename: string\n  type: string\n  url: string\n  size: number | null\n  deal_id: string\n}) {\n  if (!clientId) return\n  const res = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/client-attachments', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      ...data,\n      client_id: clientId,\n      deal_id: data.deal_id || null,\n    }),\n  })\n  if (res.ok) {\n    setAddAttachmentOpen(false)\n    loadClientData()  // Reload all data\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Backend API Endpoint** - Data Persistence\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/client-attachments.ts`\n\nThe Netlify function handles three operations:\n\n**GET** - Fetch attachments for a client:\n```typescript\nGET /client-attachments?clientId=...\nReturns: { attachments: Attachment[] }\n```\nJoins with deals table to include `deal_name`.\n\n**POST** - Create new attachment:\n```typescript\nPOST /client-attachments\nBody: {\n  filename: string\n  type: string\n  url: string\n  size?: number\n  client_id: string\n  deal_id?: string\n}\nReturns: Attachment object (201 status)\n```\nAdditionally creates a timeline event with type `'attachment_added'` for audit trail.\n\n**DELETE** - Remove attachment:\n```typescript\nDELETE /client-attachments/:attachmentId\nReturns: { success: true }\n```\n\n### 4. **Type Definition**\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport type AttachmentType = 'document' | 'link'\n\nexport interface Attachment {\n  id: string\n  filename: string\n  type: AttachmentType\n  url: string\n  size: number | null\n  client_id: string\n  deal_id: string | null\n  deal_name: string | null\n  created_at: string\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Display Components**\n\n**AttachmentsSection** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AttachmentsSection.tsx`):\n- Displays list of attachments\n- Shows filename, type label, creation date, and linked deal\n- File attachments have Download button\n- Link attachments have View (external link) button\n- All have Delete button\n\n**DealAttachmentsSection** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/DealAttachmentsSection.tsx`):\n- Similar display for deal-specific attachments\n- Shows file size formatting\n- Same download/view/delete actions\n\n**AttachmentPreview** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/AttachmentPreview.tsx`):\n- Shows thumbnail for images or icon based on file type\n- Supports categories: image, video, audio, spreadsheet, presentation, code, archive, document, link\n\n### 6. **Utility Functions**\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/attachmentUtils.ts`\n\n- `getFileCategory(filename, type)`: Determines file type from extension\n- `getFileTypeLabel(filename, type)`: Returns human-readable type label\n\n### Data Flow Diagram\n\n```\nAddAttachmentModal.tsx\n       ↓ (onSave callback)\nClientDetailPage.tsx → handleAddAttachment()\n       ↓ (POST request)\nclient-attachments.ts (Netlify)\n       ↓ (INSERT INTO DB)\nDatabase (attachments table)\n       ↓ (+ timeline event)\nDatabase (timeline_events table)\n       ↓ (Response with deal_name)\nClientDetailPage.tsx → loadClientData()\n       ↓ (GET request)\nclient-attachments.ts (Netlify)\n       ↓ (SELECT with JOIN)\nDatabase\n       ↓ (setAttachments state)\nAttachmentsSection.tsx (Display)\n```"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: afc4196 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 31638\ntool_uses: 16\nduration_ms: 25116</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"351c7274-5e41-434e-b128-bd6636f90849","uuid":"c5b09f73-5ba8-4b81-bf78-ee7d23633cda","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Search in /repo/apps/SalesCRM for all code related to attachments -

Let me create a summary document with all the findings.\n\n## Attachment Data Flow Summary\n\nI've found the complete attachment system in the SalesCRM app. Here's the full data flow:\n\n### 1. **Modal Component** - Data Entry Point\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddAttachmentModal.tsx`\n\nThe modal handles two types of attachments:\n- **File Upload**: Creates a blob URL via `URL.createObjectURL(file)`\n- **Link URL**: Accepts a URL with optional display name\n\nThe modal emits an `onSave` callback with this structure:\n```typescript\n{\n  filename: string\n  type: 'document' | 'link'\n  url: string\n  size: number | null\n  deal_id: string  // Optional associated deal\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Parent Component** - Modal Orchestration\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientDetailPage.tsx`\n\nThe `ClientDetailPage` component:\n- Manages modal open/close state (`addAttachmentOpen`)\n- Loads attachments on component mount via `loadClientData()` \n- Passes the `handleAddAttachment` function to the modal via `onSave` prop\n- Handles deletion via `handleDeleteAttachment`\n\nThe attachment handler function:\n```typescript\nasync function handleAddAttachment(data: {\n  filename: string\n  type: string\n  url: string\n  size: number | null\n  deal_id: string\n}) {\n  if (!clientId) return\n  const res = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/client-attachments', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      ...data,\n      client_id: clientId,\n      deal_id: data.deal_id || null,\n    }),\n  })\n  if (res.ok) {\n    setAddAttachmentOpen(false)\n    loadClientData()  // Reload all data\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Backend API Endpoint** - Data Persistence\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/client-attachments.ts`\n\nThe Netlify function handles three operations:\n\n**GET** - Fetch attachments for a client:\n```typescript\nGET /client-attachments?clientId=...\nReturns: { attachments: Attachment[] }\n```\nJoins with deals table to include `deal_name`.\n\n**POST** - Create new attachment:\n```typescript\nPOST /client-attachments\nBody: {\n  filename: string\n  type: string\n  url: string\n  size?: number\n  client_id: string\n  deal_id?: string\n}\nReturns: Attachment object (201 status)\n```\nAdditionally creates a timeline event with type `'attachment_added'` for audit trail.\n\n**DELETE** - Remove attachment:\n```typescript\nDELETE /client-attachments/:attachmentId\nReturns: { success: true }\n```\n\n### 4. **Type Definition**\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport type AttachmentType = 'document' | 'link'\n\nexport interface Attachment {\n  id: string\n  filename: string\n  type: AttachmentType\n  url: string\n  size: number | null\n  client_id: string\n  deal_id: string | null\n  deal_name: string | null\n  created_at: string\n}\n```\n\n### 5. **Display Components**\n\n**AttachmentsSection** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AttachmentsSection.tsx`):\n- Displays list of attachments\n- Shows filename, type label, creation date, and linked deal\n- File attachments have Download button\n- Link attachments have View (external link) button\n- All have Delete button\n\n**DealAttachmentsSection** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/DealAttachmentsSection.tsx`):\n- Similar display for deal-specific attachments\n- Shows file size formatting\n- Same download/view/delete actions\n\n**AttachmentPreview** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/AttachmentPreview.tsx`):\n- Shows thumbnail for images or icon based on file type\n- Supports categories: image, video, audio, spreadsheet, presentation, code, archive, document, link\n\n### 6. **Utility Functions**\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/attachmentUtils.ts`\n\n- `getFileCategory(filename, type)`: Determines file type from extension\n- `getFileTypeLabel(filename, type)`: Returns human-readable type label\n\n### Data Flow Diagram\n\n```\nAddAttachmentModal.tsx\n       ↓ (onSave callback)\nClientDetailPage.tsx → handleAddAttachment()\n       ↓ (POST request)\nclient-attachments.ts (Netlify)\n       ↓ (INSERT INTO DB)\nDatabase (attachments table)\n       ↓ (+ timeline event)\nDatabase (timeline_events table)\n       ↓ (Response with deal_name)\nClientDetailPage.tsx → loadClientData()\n       ↓ (GET request)\nclient-attachments.ts (Netlify)\n       ↓ (SELECT with JOIN)\nDatabase\n       ↓ (setAttachments state)\nAttachmentsSection.tsx (Display)\n```"}],"totalDurationMs":25116,"totalTokens":31638,"totalToolUseCount":16,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1028,"cache_read_input_tokens":29256,"output_tokens":1349,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1028},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Now I have all the information I need. Let me create a comprehensive report.\n\n## Summary: UploadThing Configuration and Usage in Sales CRM\n\nBased on my thorough search of the `/repo/apps/SalesCRM` directory, here are my findings:\n\n### 1. Package Installation and Versions\n\n**Installed Dependencies:**\n- `uploadthing`: **v7.4.0** (in `package.json` line 33)\n- `@uploadthing/react`: **v7.1.0** (in `package.json` line 20)\n\nBoth packages are listed in the project dependencies and have their respective node_modules folders installed.\n\n### 2. Configuration Status\n\n**Current State: NOT CONFIGURED FOR PRODUCTION USE**\n\nThere is **NO UploadThing configuration** in the codebase. Specifically:\n- No `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` or `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` environment variables in `.env` file\n- No UploadThing router or API endpoint configured (no `createUploadthing`, `uploadRouter`, or route handler)\n- No UploadThing provider or middleware setup in the application\n- The packages are installed but not actively integrated\n\n**Environment Variables Found:** \nOnly database-related env vars are configured:\n```\nDATABASE_URL=postgresql://...\nNEON_PROJECT_ID=...\n```\n\n### 3. Current Usage Pattern in Codebase\n\nThe application uses a **placeholder/manual file handling approach**:\n\n**Files with Attachment Handling:**\n\n1. **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddAttachmentModal.tsx`** (Line 31):\n   - Contains comment: `// In production this would use UploadThing`\n   - Currently uses `URL.createObjectURL(file)` for temporary URLs\n   - Accepts both file uploads and link URLs\n   - Does NOT upload files anywhere\n\n2. **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/UploadAttachmentModal.tsx`**:\n   - Similar manual file handling pattern\n   - Supports File Upload and Link URL modes\n   - Uses `URL.createObjectURL(file)` for object URLs\n   - No actual file upload implementation\n\n3. **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/client-attachments.ts`**:\n   - API endpoint that accepts attachment data (filename, type, url, size)\n   - Stores attachment metadata in Postgres database\n   - **Does NOT handle file uploads** - just stores URLs and metadata\n\n### 4. Architecture for File Storage\n\nThe system is designed for UploadThing integration but currently operates as follows:\n\n**Frontend Flow:**\n- Users select files in modals (AddAttachmentModal, UploadAttachmentModal)\n- Files are converted to object URLs or link strings\n- Metadata is sent to backend API\n\n**Backend Flow:**\n- API endpoint (`POST /.netlify/functions/client-attachments`)\n- Accepts: `{filename, type, url, size, client_id, deal_id}`\n- Stores in `attachments` table in Postgres\n- Creates timeline events for audit trail\n\n**Data Model** (`src/types/index.ts` lines 113-123):\n```typescript\nexport interface Attachment {\n  id: string\n  filename: string\n  type: AttachmentType  // 'document' | 'link'\n  url: string\n  size: number | null\n  client_id: string\n  deal_id: string | null\n  deal_name: string | null\n  created_at: string\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Search Patterns Not Found\n\nThe following UploadThing patterns are **NOT present** in the codebase:\n- `useUploadThing()` hook\n- `generateUploadButton()`\n- `generateUploadDropzone()`\n- `UTApi` usage\n- `createUploadthing()` or `uploadRouter()` configuration\n- `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` or `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` environment variables\n- UploadThing provider wrapper component\n- Any UploadThing API route handlers\n\n### 6. Test Specifications\n\nThe test specs (in `docs/tests.md`) expect the following attachment behavior:\n- **CDP-QA-07**: \"Uploading an attachment persists and shows in Attachments section\" - expects file upload via UploadThing\n- **CDP-ATT-02**: Download button should work\n- **CDP-ATT-04**: Delete button should remove attachment \"from storage\"\n- **DDP-ATT-03**: \"Uploading a file adds it to attachments list\"\n\nThe tests pass with the current object URL approach, but they're not testing actual file persistence.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**UploadThing is installed but not configured or integrated.** The application has:\n- Package dependencies installed (`uploadthing` v7.4.0, `@uploadthing/react` v7.1.0)\n- Placeholder file handling in UI components\n- Database schema ready for attachment metadata\n- API endpoints to store attachment records\n- **Missing**: Actual UploadThing router, API keys, authentication, and file upload implementation\n\nTo activate UploadThing, you would need to:\n1. Create UploadThing account and get `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` and `UPLOADTHING_SECRET`\n2. Create UploadThing router with endpoint configuration\n3. Set up API route for file uploads\n4. Replace object URL approach with actual `useUploadThing()` hook usage\n5. Configure UploadThing provider in the app\n6.

The routing logic has been moved to the internals, meaning it now returns a single handler for all methods.\n\n- The token is a base64-encoded JSON object that contains information such as your app ID, the app region, as well as the API key. The token is available in the UploadThing Dashboard under API Keys (V7 tab). If you previously passed in the API key as a configuration object, the keys in the config object have changed to reflect the new token structure — using `token` instead of `uploadthingSecret` and `uploadthingAppId`.\n\n- In v7, a new configuration provider was introduced that allows you to configure UploadThing more easily. All the options that can be passed as a configuration object (e.g., `createRouteHandler#config`) can now also be passed as an environment variable in constant case prefixed with `UPLOADTHING`.\n\n- For the **generic server** adapter (not Next.js-specific), the setup now looks like:\n  The handler is exported as both `GET` and `POST` from a single `createRouteHandler({ router, config })` call.\n\n- For **Next.js** specifically: The Next.js adapter still returns named exports for `GET` and `POST` methods via `createRouteHandler` from `\"uploadthing/next\"`.\n\n---\n\n## Netlify Functions — Modern API\n\nRegarding Netlify Functions and how they could integrate:\n\n- The new Netlify Functions API has a really simple design built around web platform standards: a function receives a `Request` and returns a `Response`. So rather than having to learn a proprietary API, your team can just learn the web platform.\n\n- You can now configure the URL right from the function code, instead of creating rewrite rules to the default `/.netlify/functions/<name>` endpoint.\n\n- Netlify plans to start deprecating the legacy functions format in 2025.\n\n---\n\n## Putting It Together\n\nUnfortunately, the search results **did not return a dedicated guide** for wiring UploadThing v7's `createRouteHandler` directly into a Netlify Function. However, since:\n\n1. UploadThing v7's `createRouteHandler` from `\"uploadthing/server\"` now returns a single **standard web handler** (receiving a `Request`, returning a `Response`), and\n2.

The routing logic has been moved to the internals, meaning it now returns a single handler for all methods.\n\n- The token is a base64-encoded JSON object that contains information such as your app ID, the app region, as well as the API key. The token is available in the UploadThing Dashboard under API Keys (V7 tab). If you previously passed in the API key as a configuration object, the keys in the config object have changed to reflect the new token structure — using `token` instead of `uploadthingSecret` and `uploadthingAppId`.\n\n- In v7, a new configuration provider was introduced that allows you to configure UploadThing more easily. All the options that can be passed as a configuration object (e.g., `createRouteHandler#config`) can now also be passed as an environment variable in constant case prefixed with `UPLOADTHING`.\n\n- For the **generic server** adapter (not Next.js-specific), the setup now looks like:\n  The handler is exported as both `GET` and `POST` from a single `createRouteHandler({ router, config })` call.\n\n- For **Next.js** specifically: The Next.js adapter still returns named exports for `GET` and `POST` methods via `createRouteHandler` from `\"uploadthing/next\"`.\n\n---\n\n## Netlify Functions — Modern API\n\nRegarding Netlify Functions and how they could integrate:\n\n- The new Netlify Functions API has a really simple design built around web platform standards: a function receives a `Request` and returns a `Response`. So rather than having to learn a proprietary API, your team can just learn the web platform.\n\n- You can now configure the URL right from the function code, instead of creating rewrite rules to the default `/.netlify/functions/<name>` endpoint.\n\n- Netlify plans to start deprecating the legacy functions format in 2025.\n\n---\n\n## Putting It Together\n\nUnfortunately, the search results **did not return a dedicated guide** for wiring UploadThing v7's `createRouteHandler` directly into a Netlify Function. However, since:\n\n1. UploadThing v7's `createRouteHandler` from `\"uploadthing/server\"` now returns a single **standard web handler** (receiving a `Request`, returning a `Response`), and\n2. Modern Netlify Functions are also built on the same **web-standard `Request`/`Response` model**,\n\n…the two should be compatible. You would create a Netlify Function (e.g., `netlify/functions/uploadthing.mts`) that imports and delegates to the UploadThing handler, mapping the incoming `Request` to the handler and returning its `Response`. You'd also need to set the `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` environment variable in your Netlify site settings.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific examples or community discussions on this integration?"],"durationSeconds":25.830637895000006}}

Let me look at how the existing Netlify functions handle requests to understand the pattern I should follow, and check the server-side `createUploadthing` and `createRouteHandler` for a generic server setup.\n\nThe approach:\n1. Create a file router definition (shared between frontend and backend references)\n2. Create a Netlify function that uses `createRouteHandler` (or rather, since Netlify Functions use standard Request/Response, I can use the `makeAdapterHandler` from `uploadthing/server`)\n3. Use `generateReactHelpers` from `@uploadthing/react` on the client side to create typed hooks\n\n\n4.

Since Netlify Functions use standard web Request/Response, I should be able to use this. Let me check the server index.js to understand the handler better.\n\nActually, I think the simplest approach here is to use the `UTApi` from `uploadthing/server` directly in a Netlify function to upload files server-side. But that requires sending the file to our Netlify function first, which is a FormData upload.\n\nWait, actually the UploadThing client-side approach is:\n\n\nThe standard flow is client metadata to server, server gets presigned URLs from UploadThing, client uploads directly to their storage, then UploadThing notifies our server when complete. To implement this with Netlify Functions, I need a file router definition, a function that handles the UploadThing route, and client-side helpers. The tricky part is that `createRouteHandler` returns adapter-specific handlers, and I need to figure out how to make it work with Netlify's standard web Request/Response model.\n\nI'm considering two approaches: using `UTApi` server-side where the frontend sends files to a Netlify function which then uploads to UploadThing, but that means double uploading. The better approach is the standard UploadThing flow where files go directly from client to their CDN, so I need to understand how `makeAdapterHandler` works with Netlify Functions.\n\nLooking at the function signature, it takes framework-specific args and returns a handler that produces a Response, but it's wrapped in Effect types which adds complexity. Since Netlify Functions already use standard web Request/Response, I'm checking if there's a simpler fetch adapter available, but it looks like the package only exports adapters for express, fastify, h3, and next.\n\nThe most practical approach is probably using UTApi directly: create a Netlify function that accepts FormData, call `UTApi.uploadFiles()` to upload to UploadThing, and return the URL. Alternatively, I could use `generateReactHelpers` with a custom URL pointing to the Netlify function and use `makeAdapterHandler` to handle the UploadThing protocol, but I should first understand how the existing adapters work internally.\n\nExamining the h3 adapter signature...\n\nFor Netlify functions, I need something that takes a `Request` and returns a `Response`, which is what `makeAdapterHandler` from `uploadthing/server` is designed for. The Effect library dependency adds complexity though. Let me reconsider the simpler approach: just use UTApi directly in a Netlify function where the frontend sends FormData to `/.netlify/functions/upload` and the function creates a UTApi instance to handle the upload.\n\nActually, rereading the original issue—the problem is that `URL.createObjectURL(file)` creates temporary blob URLs that don't persist after a page refresh, so any URL saved to the database becomes invalid. I need to upload files to a persistent storage and store that URL instead. Using UTApi server-side is the cleanest solution here.\n\nMy plan is to create a Netlify function that accepts FormData, uploads it to UploadThing using UTApi, and returns the persistent URL. I'm narrowing my focus to just AddAttachmentModal as specified in the job description, though I recognize the same issue exists elsewhere. For the implementation, I'm realizing I can use UploadThing's client-side helpers directly rather than building a server function—the client can upload files straight to UploadThing, which is cleaner than routing through our
