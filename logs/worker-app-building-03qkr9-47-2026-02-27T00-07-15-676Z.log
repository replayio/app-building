You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

The global CSS handles table card mode at 480px, column hiding at various breakpoints through both Tailwind classes and media queries, page padding adjustments, filter bar wrapping, and modal responsiveness.\n\nNow I'm checking what patterns were used on the completed pages like Dashboard and Accounts to see if there's anything missing from MaterialsPage. Looking at the skill requirements against what's already implemented, the page padding with `p-6 max-sm:p-3` is there, the page title typography is handled through the CSS media query at 640px, and I need to verify button text hiding and pagination wrapping are properly applied. on labels - Already done ✓\n4. **Filter bar wrapping**: Already `flex-wrap` on `.filter-bar` ✓\n5. **Table column hiding**: Category at lg, Unit at md - Already done ✓\n6. **Card mode at 480px**: Already in CSS ✓\n7. **Modal responsiveness**: Already in CSS ✓\n\nThe MaterialsPage and its components seem to already have most responsive patterns applied. But let me check if there are missing responsive patterns compared to the completed pages. Let me look at the DashboardPage and AccountsPage to see what patterns they applied.\n\nActually, looking more closely, I think the page is already fairly well set up for responsiveness based on the existing global CSS and the Tailwind-like utility classes already in the components. But let me check if there are specific things that might be missing - the search input should probably expand to full width on smaller screens, and the pagination info might need to be hidden on mobile. Let me examine the MaterialsSearchBar, MaterialsSortDropdown, and MaterialsPagination components to see what adjustments are needed.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":20832,"cache_read_input_tokens":32019,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":20832,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b38b7bab-b114-4633-ba46-b059a2c974c4","uuid":"f9424b67-edda-468a-8bde-9b5f4b40d680"}

Let me analyze what needs to change:\n\n**MaterialsPage.tsx** - Already has:\n- `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the page wrapper ✓\n- `max-sm:hidden` on button labels ✓\n\n**MaterialsTable.tsx** - Already has:\n- Column hiding: Category `max-lg:hidden`, Unit of Measure `max-md:hidden` ✓\n- Text link hiding with `max-sm:hidden` ✓\n- Icon buttons for view/edit ✓\n\n**MaterialsSearchBar.tsx** - Issue:\n\n\n- The fixed `maxWidth: 300` inline style restricts the search bar on mobile, so I need to make it expand to full width on smaller screens.\n\n**MaterialsPagination.tsx** - Issues:\n- The info text showing item counts should be hidden on narrow screens, and the Previous/Next button labels could be abbreviated.\n\n**CreateMaterialModal.tsx** and **CreateCategoryModal.tsx** - Already handled by global CSS modal styles ✓\n\n**index.css** - Already has:\n- Card mode at 480px ✓\n- Column hiding media queries ✓\n- Modal responsiveness ✓\n- Filter styling in place ✓\n\nSo the key improvements are making the search bar responsive by removing or conditionally applying that max-width constraint, hiding the pagination info text on very small screens, and ensuring the page header actions wrap properly on mobile. I'm thinking through how to make the search bar responsive—it currently maxes out at 300px, which might look cramped on very narrow screens. I should add a CSS rule so that on screens around 480px or smaller, the search input takes up the full width of its container while maintaining a reasonable minimum width on larger screens. Width of none and width 100%.\n\nActually, the simplest approach is to add a media query in the CSS to make the search input full width on smaller screens, and I'll add the `max-sm:hidden` class to hide the pagination info on mobile.\n\nLet me reconsider though—since the project uses custom CSS classes mimicking Tailwind rather than actual Tailwind, the cleanest solution is to override the inline `maxWidth: 300` style with a media query at 480px, then hide the pagination details on small screens with the existing class.\n\nAdding the CSS rule and updating the components
