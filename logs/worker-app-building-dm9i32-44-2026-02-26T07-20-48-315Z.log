The test spec for BatchOverview in tests.md says:\n\n1. There should be a \"Batch Overview\" section heading displayed on the left side of the page\n2. There should be a card with the heading \"Current Quantity & Properties\"\n\nThe violation states that the code only has the 'Current Quantity & Properties' card heading but is missing the 'Batch Overview' section heading.\n\nLet me read the BatchOverview component and the writeApp.md directives (which I've already read). The relevant directive is:\n- \"When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\"\n\n\nI need to examine the BatchOverview component to see what's currently being rendered and identify where the missing section heading should be added.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4720,"cache_read_input_tokens":36396,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4720,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"69576843-35ac-4ce0-9ca5-ec90e8d6a9d5","uuid":"feb3289d-da0d-4d12-a7a1-7b932d63e40b"}
