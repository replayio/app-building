For the task files `tasks-app-building-cps77p.json` and `tasks-app-building-qag3kn.json`: These still have conflict markers that need to be resolved.\n\nLet me check what the current state of tests.md is (post-merge).","signature":"Et8FCkYICxgCKkCcLA/9Tl3+EPpXWzO2+8dBskSoUYCwwR/eNVJ1bKX38E2kuh52mEHROvCrT2k/tsIzz0ewx2YbcLjr1CYXY79CEgyW91f0aD1SKJMV7agaDLw/xlP3CvS1XkgXkCIwhmHNwEvXwoLCto3jRhpQdimSncUKGgk51D0VU+IYxoBnN19RvszMxSGZiGCnpEGRKsYELev/t8CZw3/yop9PRezSaMaPUhTL/kuWksB6jCGmGUE9DQN2hBcp/GVvLvywjIx8wdYrXOMFM0eKh3BOhCcMGvKSriOzWEBDXSVFbn358M4UavQWc4LYmLS+4en+yTjy5k3Z04L/+JQ1crh4MlamGCcFmcsfQxyXMmdzN7yWzbvITCKCqb36hTtY9Qe1pqyvMBoAqPOkvJZat8ItGO+y/trazaPJzA7lz+MlcT4UII5e1w/dpYeQLafvIJP/CoC/RW9tfBa62e/U9vF2ATOb4O4C/LfiyPp+FDmWuBOitikTjvRmzDP/AIJ0//4SpmIGMI8wsZNbPpL0pKb6af2f/3uqRfZGkaBAMwVpnM/PNUzHG/ewV9phW8YC6dOsHcSNCtNNJqeTVcEhYLzkvMWLeMNJ2qiQfKFIzyyfClRCIcMOH7Ny8p8dVYGn85IBiIajIB67cgQousTVsHDL1nmtDwNjgo6Tzy339hM99e4F38rBGGpyQ8zOMX6IyNGjXEk+caBCeUA9pBAir1BpRyyFirX0HCNWIG1j8eMDww6zkAEWfFoCT1NiVG/AykfRDbJa1VLa40Yt2R37+rfcdBf6C7+VNCaB5qG1HzyLgQWuPXHDCCePyOCUxCPIypN98n99HLi1EIow6+UXxBu9KHCwMUQWaB7itzeChEaBk87ICgWgnbYSnKoyoHX9yCA94GYc8lwWAS7IO6PBdtHbZGOXtof6seDMqOb8xzysqbz8nYwU189UiS9ykYxVes9FCSuGkIpx88eoGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4961,"cache_read_input_tokens":29885,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4961,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"db473917-a488-4815-a1f4-f95b73f51def","uuid":"98346192-872c-48ca-82cb-ac467685810b"}

The tests.md file looks clean - no conflict markers. Now I need to fix the task files that have conflict markers. Let me understand what the correct content should be for each task file.\n\nFor `tasks-app-building-cps77p.json`: This is a task file for a different container. Looking at it, the tasks after the conflict markers are a standard set of build tasks for todo-app. The first task (testSpec) has been partially completed (it was about PlanPages), and the later tasks are about PlanPageTodoList subtasks. The conflict markers are from merging different states of this file.\n\nFor `tasks-app-building-qag3kn.json`: Similar situation - it's a task file for yet another container.\n\n\nSince these are managed by the add-task system, I should clean them up by removing the conflict markers and keeping the remote version from origin/main, which is what the merge strategy accepted.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4122,"cache_read_input_tokens":35226,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4122,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"db473917-a488-4815-a1f4-f95b73f51def","uuid":"3346af12-45d9-45b8-9948-ddffad107ff6"}
