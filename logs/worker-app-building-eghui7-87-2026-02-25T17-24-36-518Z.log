Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

Images of different pages: consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one\n\n\n3. Don't skip implementation shortcuts—test all columns and filter controls comprehensively\n4. Every clickable element needs explicit navigation targets or action results specified\n5. Data mutations must verify persistence and side effects like history entries\n6. Test button and control styling, not just their presence\n7. Modal dialogs need complete functional testing\n8. File upload support for attachments\n9. Import/upload dialogs must document expected data formats\n10. Backend integrations require full setup documentation\n11. State-changing actions need verification that the rest of the app updates accordingly\n\nNow I'm checking the SupplierDetailsPage against the writeApp.md requirements—making sure test entries cover all the directives like adding data-testid attributes to interactive elements, using tagged template literals for database queries, converting empty strings to null for date/timestamp fields, implementing searchable dropdowns for entity references, and avoiding duplicate navigation links.\n\nThen I need to verify the tests follow writeTests.md standards, which means confirming that navigation assertions check the actual URL and page content, that tests interact directly with components rather than bypassing them, that side effects are verified alongside primary effects, and that test selectors use data-testid and role-based queries instead of relying on text content.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8220,"cache_read_input_tokens":38649,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8220,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","infer

Now let me start **Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage**. I need to systematically check each test entry in the SupplierDetailsPage section of `docs/tests.md` against the testSpec.md directives. The SupplierDetailsPage test entries span lines 226-447 of docs/tests.md. Let me re-read that section and check each entry against the directives.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage\n\nThe SupplierDetailsPage section in docs/tests.md (lines 226-447) has these sections:\n- **SupplierOverview** (lines 232-279)\n- **DocumentsTab** (lines 281-323)\n- **CommentsSection** (lines 325-364)\n- **OrdersSection** (lines 366-446)\n\nLet me now systematically check each test entry against testSpec.md directives.\n\n### Checking testSpec.md directives against SupplierDetailsPage entries:\n\n**Directive 1: Systematically inventory every visible element — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n\nLet me check each section:\n\n**SupplierOverview section** (lines 232-279):\n- Display Supplier Name ✓\n- Display Supplier Address ✓ \n- Display Contact Information ✓\n- Display Supplier Description ✓\n- Display Status Badge ✓\n- Back to Dashboard Button Navigates to Dashboard ✓\n- Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog ✓\n- Delete Supplier with Confirmation ✓\n\n**Breadcrumb navigation** (line 228): Specified: \"Home > Suppliers > \\<Supplier Name\\> > Supplier Details\". Clicking \"Home\" → /. Clicking \"Suppliers\" → /.\n\nLet me check: is there a test entry for the breadcrumb navigation itself? Let me re-read the section carefully.\n\nLooking at lines 226-228:\n```\n## SupplierDetailsPage (/suppliers/:supplierId)\n\nBreadcrumb navigation shows \"Home > Suppliers > <Supplier Name> > Supplier Details\". Clicking \"Home\" navigates to /. Clicking \"Suppliers\" navigates to /.\n```\n\nThis specifies breadcrumb behavior but there's no dedicated test entry for it. Let me check if there's a test entry for breadcrumb.\n\nLooking at the SupplierDetailsPage section... I see there's no test entry titled for the breadcrumb navigation. The breadcrumb is described in the page header but not as a testable entry with a Given/When/Then.\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.**\n\nThe breadcrumb has clickable elements (\"Home\" → /, \"Suppliers\" → /) but no dedicated test entry. However, the behavior IS specified at line 228 — it just doesn't follow Given/When/Then format as a test entry.\n\nLet me also check the tab links described at line 230: \"Below the SupplierOverview section, three tab links appear: 'Documents', 'Comments', 'Orders'. Clicking a tab scrolls to or reveals that section's content.\"\n\nThere's no test entry for the tab navigation itself.\n\n**DocumentsTab section** (lines 281-323):\n- Display Document Cards with Details ✓\n- Display Multiple Document Cards ✓\n- Search Documents by Name ✓\n- Search Documents Clears Results ✓\n- Upload Document Button Opens Upload Dialog ✓\n- View Document Action ✓\n- Download Document Action ✓\n\n**Directive 8: Attachment functionality should support file uploads**\nThe Upload Document test entry (lines 307-313) does specify file upload. ✓\n\n**CommentsSection** (lines 325-364):\n- Display Comments Header with Count ✓\n- Display Comment List with Timestamps and Authors ✓\n- Add Comment via Input Field ✓\n- Add Comment Persists After Reload ✓\n- Collapse and Expand Comments Section ✓\n- Empty Comment Validation ✓\n\n**Directive 5: For any user action that mutates data, verify change is persisted and side effects occur**\n- \"Add Comment via Input Field\" verifies the comment appears and count increments ✓\n- \"Add Comment Persists After Reload\" verifies persistence ✓\n\n**OrdersSection** (lines 366-446):\n- Display Upcoming and Historical Order Tabs ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Data ✓\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Data ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Search Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Search Historical Orders ✓\n- Filter Upcoming Orders by Status ✓\n- Status Badges in Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Status Badges in Historical Orders ✓\n- Switch Between Tabs ✓\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target**\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78901\" ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78801\" ✓\n\n**Directive 7: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**\n- Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog: Tests opening, pre-filled values, save, and persistence ✓\n- Delete Supplier with Confirmation: Tests confirmation dialog ✓\n- Upload Document: Tests file upload dialog ✓\n\nNow let me check if there's a test entry for the **Edit Supplier Dialog Validation** — the directive says to completely test modal dialogs. The edit dialog has a save action but no validation test. Let me also check if there's a cancel test for edit. Looking at the entry on line 266-270:\n\n```\n**Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog**\nGiven the user is viewing the SupplierDetailsPage,\nWhen the user clicks the \"Edit\" button in SupplierOverview,\nThen a modal dialog opens pre-filled with the supplier's current values (name, address, contact name, phone, email, description, status),\nAnd when the user changes the contact phone number and clicks \"Save\",\nThen the updated phone number is persisted and reflected in SupplierOverview.\n```\n\nThere's no cancel test and no validation test for the Edit Supplier dialog. For the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard, there ARE cancel and validation entries. This is inconsistent.\n\nSimilarly, for the Delete Supplier, there's no test for what happens if the user cancels the confirmation dialog.\n\nLet me also check if there are missing entries per **Directive 6: Button and control appearance matters**. I see status badge entries cover color coding. Let me check if there are entries for the Edit/Delete button appearance (icons, styling).\n\nThe Edit button mention at line 267 says \"Edit\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\nThe Delete button mention at line 273 says \"Delete\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\n\nHowever, this level of detail may not be required since the spec doesn't show a mockup for this page.\n\nLet me now also check: the breadcrumb navigation is specified in the header but not tested with entries. I see the Dashboard page also specifies breadcrumb for detail pages at line 10: \"Breadcrumb navigation appears on detail pages (SupplierDetailsPage, OrderDetailsPage).\"\n\nLet me check if there are test entries for breadcrumb navigation in the OrderDetailsPage section for comparison.\n\nLooking at line 452: \"Breadcrumb navigation shows 'Dashboard > Orders > Order #\\<orderId\\>'. Clicking 'Dashboard' navigates to /. Clicking 'Orders' navigates to /.\"\n\nSame pattern — breadcrumb specified in header but no dedicated test entries. This is consistent across pages, so while it could be a violation, it's a pattern across the whole app.\n\nLet me now summarize the potential violations I've found:\n\n1. **Missing breadcrumb navigation test entries** — The breadcrumb is described in the page header but lacks dedicated Given/When/Then test entries. Per directive \"systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"for every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target\", the breadcrumb \"Home\" and \"Suppliers\" links should have test entries.\n\n2. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog cancel test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a cancel test (similar to how the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard has \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\").\n\n3. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog validation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a validation test (similar to \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" on the Dashboard).\n\n4. **Missing Delete Supplier cancel confirmation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Delete Supplier confirmation should have a test for canceling/dismissing the confirmation.\n\nWait — let me re-check if the breadcrumb issue was already found and fixed. Let me check the recent commits."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":609,"cache_read_input_tokens":48513,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":609,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"52575517-e3b8-40fd-bfa2-99278497cf71","uuid":"46760151-e553-4de1-9e94-b8b34be54407"}
