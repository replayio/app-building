Let me analyze what shared code InventoryTracker needs:\n\n1. **Accounting** is the most similar app - it already uses shared code\n2. InventoryTracker has double-entry transactions (like Accounting)\n3. InventoryTracker has accounts with categories (like Accounting)\n4. InventoryTracker has materials with categories\n\nExisting shared code already available:\n- `auth/authSlice.ts` and `auth/useAuth.ts` - auth (already shared)\n- `backend/db.ts` - database utilities (already shared)\n- `components/CategorySection.tsx` - category grouping (already shared, used by Accounting)\n\n\n- `layout/Sidebar.tsx` and `layout/AppLayout.tsx` - layout (already shared)\n- `store/store.ts` and `store/hooks.ts` - Redux store (already shared)\n- `styles/tokens.css` and `styles/layout.css` - design tokens (already shared)\n- `utils/currency.ts` - currency formatting (already shared)\n- `utils/doubleEntry.ts` - double-entry validation (already shared, mentions InventoryTracker)\n\nI should look at what other apps might benefit from shared code and break down any additional opportunities into subtasks.\n\nLooking at InventoryTracker's structure, I can see several pages with different concerns—dashboards with summary widgets, category-based account views similar to what Accounting uses, detail pages for accounts and materials, and transaction management. I should identify which components or logic could be extracted as shared utilities versus what needs to stay app-specific. I'm realizing the subtask already starts with \"Unpack:\" so I'm in the unpacking phase where I need to identify shared code opportunities across apps and create subtasks for the actual implementation work. The skill wants me to break this down into one subtask for app-wide shared code and then individual subtasks for each page's shared components. most of the foundational shared code is already in place for both apps, so I need to figure out what new shared utilities InventoryTracker actually requires that Accounting doesn't already provide. Looking at the page structures, both apps follow similar patterns with categorized accounts and double-entry transactions, which means I might not need to create as many subtasks as I initially thought. I'm realizing I need to actually verify whether Accounting has any source code implemented yet before I can identify what should be refactored into shared components—the skill emphasizes that shared

I now have all the information. Let me compile a comprehensive analysis.\n\n## Complete Accounting App Analysis for InventoryTracker Reference\n\nI've read all the files from the Accounting app. Here's a detailed analysis of patterns and components that would be relevant for an InventoryTracker app:\n\n---\n\n### **1. FILE-BY-FILE BREAKDOWN**\n\n#### **App.tsx** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/App.tsx`)\n- **What it does**: Sets up React Router with 7 routes (login, dashboard, accounts list, account details, reports list, report details, budgets)\n- **App-specific vs. Generalizable**: Mostly generalizable - the routing pattern is standard and could apply to InventoryTracker with different pages\n- **InventoryTracker equivalent**: Would likely have `/inventory`, `/inventory/:id`, `/movements`, `/reports`, `/settings` routes\n- **Key insight**: Uses `<Navigate>` to redirect root to `/accounts` - InventoryTracker could redirect to `/inventory`\n\n---\n\n#### **store.ts** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/store.ts`)\n- **What it does**: Creates Redux store combining auth and 4 domain slices (accounts, transactions, reports, budgets)\n- **App-specific vs. Generalizable**: Highly generalizable - uses `createAppStore` from shared utilities\n- **InventoryTracker equivalent**: Would combine auth with inventory items, movements, locations, and possibly categories slices\n- **Key insight**: Uses Redux Toolkit with async thunks for API calls - same pattern works for inventory domain\n\n---\n\n#### **hooks.ts** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/hooks.ts`)\n- **What it does**: Exports typed Redux hooks (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`)\n- **App-specific vs. Generalizable**: Completely generic - can be reused directly\n- **InventoryTracker equivalent**: No changes needed - same hooks apply to any Redux-based app\n\n---\n\n#### **AccountsPage.tsx** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/pages/AccountsPage.tsx`)\n- **What it does**: Main list page showing all accounts grouped by category (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Expenses) with expandable sections\n- **App-specific vs. Generalizable**: Architecture is highly generalizable, content is specific\n- **InventoryTracker equivalent**: `InventoryPage` showing items grouped by category/location with expandable sections.

Let me analyze the shared code opportunities for InventoryTracker:\n\nThe existing shared code covers:\n1. **Auth** - authSlice, useAuth (already shared)\n2. **Backend** - db.ts with query utilities (already shared)\n3. **Components** - CategorySection (already shared)\n4. **Layout** - Sidebar, AppLayout (already shared)\n5. **Store** - createAppStore, createTypedHooks (already shared)\n6. **Styles** - tokens.css, layout.css (already shared)\n7. **Utils** - currency.ts, doubleEntry.ts (already shared)\n\n\n8. **Navigation** - Sidebar and AppLayout patterns (already shared)\n\nLooking at the Accounting app, most of the code is domain-specific, so the shared patterns are already captured in `apps/shared`. I need to identify what genuinely new shared code could be extracted by comparing InventoryTracker's pages with Accounting's structure.\n\nThe store setup will leverage `createAppStore` from shared, and Redux typed hooks are handled via `createTypedHooks` which is already shared. When I look at the page-level components, the dashboards are app-specific (Accounting's is a placeholder while InventoryTracker has alerts and material categories), the accounts pages both use the shared `CategoryGroup` component but differ in their data models, and the detail pages handle completely different entities. The materials pages are unique to InventoryTracker with no equivalent elsewhere.\n\nFor transactions, both apps have lists and detail views with similar patterns—the double-entry validation logic is already shared—but the Accounting app uses a modal for creation while InventoryTracker uses a full page. I'm realizing the key question is what truly warrants sharing: the skill emphasizes that shared code needs identical or nearly identical requirements across apps, so `CategorySection` and `doubleEntry.ts` are good candidates, but I need to be more selective about what else gets extracted.\n\nLooking at the navigation layer, the Accounting app has its own horizontal NavBar with breadcrumbs while the shared `Sidebar` and `AppLayout` handle sidebar-based layouts—these serve fundamentally different purposes, so they shouldn't be forced into a shared component.\n\nDigging into what could actually be shared between the apps, most foundational pieces already exist. The `NewTransactionModal` in Accounting handles debit/credit entries while InventoryTracker's transaction page manages quantity transfers and batch creation—the structures differ enough that they'd need separate implementations. Similarly, `AccountCard` displays financial metrics in a way that doesn't align with InventoryTracker's account structure.\n\nThe real question is whether unpacking this into subtasks makes sense. The skill mentions only doing that when there are other apps AND when code would be identical or nearly identical across them. Looking at what's actually needed—auth, store setup, layout—most of that's already in shared. The pages themselves are too domain-specific to warrant shared components, so I'm not sure there's enough new shared code to justify breaking this into separate tasks. backend DB utilities - all already in shared. Nothing new to add.\n\n2. **Dashboard page**: Different widgets across apps. Not shareable.\n\n3. **Accounts/List pages**: Both Accounting and InventoryTracker have categorized account lists using CategorySection (already shared).\n\n4. **Detail pages**: Different detail views per domain. Not shareable.\n\n5. **Transaction pages**: Both have transaction creation with double-entry validation (already shared in doubleEntry.ts). The forms themselves are different enough.\n\n6. **Materials, Batches pages**: Unique to InventoryTracker.\n\nLooking more closely, I notice some potential patterns - both apps have tables with sorting and filtering, filter bars with different criteria, and detail page layouts with headers and sections that could be standardized. But most of the truly identical code is already extracted into shared utilities.\n\nThe skill requires me to unpack into subtasks if other apps exist, so I should create them even if some turn out to be no-ops. The key is focusing on areas where there's actual shared code to write or refactor rather than creating busywork. Looking at the transaction pages, I notice they share similar patterns with Accounting's implementation—particularly the transaction list and detail views—though the data structures differ enough that I'd need to be careful about what actually gets reused. For the new transaction form, the double-entry validation is already shared, but the UI differs significantly since inventory handles quantity transfers and batch creation while accounting works with debit/credit entries. Given that most shared code already exists, I should probably consolidate this into fewer subtasks and focus on refactoring what's genuinely reusable rather than creating separate tasks for each page. The shared code patterns are becoming clearer—navigation headers, category sections, double-entry transactions, and filtered tables appear across multiple pages. But I'm overcomplicating this. The instruction is straightforward: one subtask for app-wide logic, then one subtask per page that actually needs shared component refactoring, not for every page regardless. I'm re-reading the skill instructions more carefully—it's asking me to check if there are other apps that could share code, and if so, unpack this into subtasks for writing or refactoring shared code. Since I do have multiple apps here, I should follow that process even if the page-level components feel domain-specific.\n\nLooking at what could actually be shared between InventoryTracker and Accounting, the app-wide patterns like store creation and hooks are already using shared utilities, so there's not much to extract there. Going through each page, the dashboards are different enough, the accounts pages both use the shared CategorySection component, and the detail pages have different data structures—so most of the page-level code is too specific to consolidate.\n\nThe real opportunity might be in generalizing patterns like Accounting's navigation structure or the transaction creation flow that both apps use, but I should focus on what's genuinely duplicated rather than creating abstractions prematurely. Accounting's transaction pages are mostly stubs, and the NewTransactionModal is specific to that app anyway. The reality is that most of the shared infrastructure already exists—auth, store, layout, backend patterns, double-entry logic, currency handling, and CategorySection are all in place. Page-level components tend to be domain-specific, so there's limited new shared code to extract. I should structure practical subtasks around verifying the existing shared code works for both apps and identifying any gaps in backend patterns or utilities that InventoryTracker needs. Looking at the page overlap, most of the shared code already exists—CategorySection is already shared for accounts, and doubleEntry handles transactions. The only pages that might benefit from additional sharing are the transaction pages, where I could potentially extract a reusable form pattern. DashboardPage and the inventory-specific pages are too different to warrant shared code. I'm realizing the app-wide logic subtask is probably the main one worth creating, since most of the per-page work would just be verification rather than actual new shared code. But let me check if there are any patterns in Accounting's NavBar or other components that should be refactored into the shared codebase for InventoryTracker to use. I'm noticing some repeated patterns across the pages—categorized lists in AccountsPage and MaterialsPage, transaction tables in TransactionsPage and its Accounting equivalent—so there might be value in extracting shared components for those patterns. I'll move forward by creating subtasks for the genuine sharing opportunities: app-wide infrastructure, the accounts/categories pages, and transaction pages. Before finalizing, I want to check whether the Accounting app's NavBar should be refactored to use the shared Sidebar/AppLayout pattern.\n\nLooking at the navigation setup, the Accounting app has its own horizontal NavBar with breadcrumbs while the shared library provides a vertical Sidebar with AppLayout. These are fundamentally different approaches, and since the shared layout already has an established pattern, refactoring Accounting's NavBar into it doesn't make sense. InventoryTracker's spec mentions a header with navigation, which could go either way, but I'll stick with the existing architectural decisions and create subtasks that focus on the actual code duplication opportunities.\n\nMost of the shared infrastructure is already in place—CategorySection handles grouping, doubleEntry validation is shared, and individual page components are too specific to extract. I'll keep the subtasks minimal and practical: one for app-wide logic and one for each page where there's genuine overlap to address. it directly uses CategorySection, and both apps have account lists) - but I'm realizing that if CategorySection already exists and handles both apps' needs, there's nothing new to write there. Same with transactions - if double-entry validation is already built, the page subtasks might be empty. I could create generic shared components like a DataTable or DetailPageLayout, but that might be over-engineering when the apps have different enough requirements. I'll just create the subtasks as the skill suggests and let the workers determine if there's actual work to be done.\n\nSo my final plan is three subtasks: one for app-wide shared code covering backend logic, reducers, auth, and navigation; one for AccountsPage components since it shares patterns with the Accounting app; and one for TransactionsPage and NewTransactionPage since both use double-entry transactions. Pages like DashboardPage, MaterialsPage, and the detail pages don't have clear overlaps, so I'll skip those.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I should check the test spec to understand shared patterns better, but that's really about behavior verification rather than identifying what code to share—I already have the AppSpec for that. Let me also consider whether other apps besides Accounting might share patterns with InventoryTracker.\n\nLooking at ProductionHub, it has materials and recipes that could theoretically overlap with InventoryTracker's material concept, but they're used in fundamentally different ways—production ingredients versus inventory quantities. SupplierTracker has purchase orders that might seem similar to transactions, but the structure is quite different with cost breakdowns rather than double-entry transfers. SalesCRM is in a completely different domain.\n\nSo the real shared patterns are with Accounting, and I should create subtasks for the app-wide logic, the CategorySection pattern on AccountsPage, and the double-entry transaction pattern across TransactionsPage and NewTransactionPage. Actually, let me reconsider this approach.\n\nThe CategorySection is already built and working well on AccountsPage—there's nothing meaningful for a worker to add there. Same with TransactionsPage and NewTransactionPage, where the doubleEntry.ts is already shared but the form UI patterns differ between apps, so there's minimal actual work. And for app-wide logic, auth, store, backend, and layout are all shared, so a worker would mostly just verify things work.\n\nI'm realizing the shared code has already been written in a previous task that set up the shared directory. What InventoryTracker actually needs is to leverage this existing shared code when building out its own app, not create new subtasks to build it again.\n\nLet me reread the skill instructions more carefully. The \"Unpack Subtasks\" section says to create subtasks that WRITE shared code—either new code or refactored code from existing apps. So I need to look at what Accounting has that should be shared but currently isn't.\n\nLooking at Accounting's components, the NavBar could potentially be shared, but we already have a Sidebar in shared code. The AccountCard is too specific to Accounting. The NewTransactionModal has a line item pattern that might be worth generalizing into shared code. The header and type definitions are domain-specific. What's interesting is that all the Redux slices follow an identical pattern—state with items, loading, and error fields, plus thunks for fetch, create, update, and delete operations with matching extra reducers. That's a strong candidate for extracting into a shared utility or factory function.\n\nA generic CRUD slice factory could be genuinely useful across multiple apps. It would generate the standard state shape, thunks, and error handling automatically, which would benefit Accounting's slices, InventoryTracker's entities, ProductionHub's recipes and equipment, SalesCRM's clients and deals, and SupplierTracker's suppliers and orders. That's a real pattern worth extracting.\n\nBut looking at the actual Accounting slices, they're not as uniform as they first appear. The transactions slice filters by account ID, the reports slice has custom state for report items, and the accounts slice has a setCurrentAccount reducer. So a factory would need to be extensible enough to handle these variations without becoming overly complex. Let me examine the actual slice implementations to see if the similarities are substantial enough to justify a factory function, or if the differences make it over-engineering. I could apply the same pattern to create and delete operations, but Redux Toolkit already handles this pretty efficiently—a factory function would only save maybe 20-30 lines per slice while adding unnecessary complexity. Let me look at what else might be worth sharing, particularly in the Netlify functions on the backend side. Actually, I have enough context now to make a decision about what's already shared and what isn't.\n\nThe core patterns are already covered—auth, database utilities, store creation, layout components, styles, and shared utilities like currency and double-entry logic. There aren't really any other page-level components that are identical enough to warrant extraction. So the real work here is just verifying the existing shared code and potentially extending it, rather than creating a bunch of no-op subtasks. Let me follow the skill and create the appropriate subtasks based on what actually needs doing.\n\nLooking at the accounts and transaction pages across both apps, there's surface-level similarity—both group accounts by category, both list transactions with dates and descriptions—but the underlying data structures diverge pretty quickly. The accounts pages display different information (financial balances versus quantity totals), and the transaction editors have different field requirements (debit/credit versus source). Extracting a shared component here would likely create more friction than it solves.\n\nI'm going to be pragmatic about this. The core shared code already exists, so I'll focus on creating subtasks where there's genuine potential: one for app-wide logic to verify and potentially expand shared utilities, and one for the transaction-related pages since the double-entry pattern appears in both apps and might have some reusable form patterns worth exploring.\n\nNow I'm checking whether these subtasks should use the same skill path as the parent task, and reviewing what AGENTS.md says about how to structure them. So the shared code was already designed with InventoryTracker in mind - components like `CategorySection` and utilities like `doubleEntry` have docstrings mentioning both Accounting and InventoryTracker. This means I probably won't need to write much new shared code, just verify what's already there works and make minor additions if needed. For the page-specific subtasks, I should focus on what each page actually needs to implement. I'm realizing the DashboardPage might have shared potential since both apps display recent transactions, but Accounting's dashboard isn't even implemented yet so there's nothing to refactor there. I'll stick with three subtasks: app-wide logic, AccountsPage for the CategorySection pattern, and a combined TransactionsPage/NewTransactionPage task for the double-entry pattern.\n\nActually, CategorySection already exists as shared code, so I should fold AccountsPage into the app-wide task instead. That leaves me with two focused subtasks: one for app-wide logic covering backend, store, auth, and navigation, and another specifically for the transaction pages where the double-entry patterns genuinely overlap. Let me verify the shared directory has all the necessary exports configured and commit to this plan. I'm reconsidering whether to combine the transaction pages into one subtask since they're closely related, and realizing that AccountsPage might already be covered by the existing CategorySection shared code. So I'm settling on two focused subtasks: one for app-wide logic and one for the transaction pages, since those are where the real overlap with Accounting exists. The other pages are either unique to InventoryTracker or already handled by existing shared components, so they don't need separate subtasks. I should make sure the subtask descriptions are detailed enough that someone working on them won't need additional context. SharedAppWide: Write/refactor shared app-wide code for InventoryTracker (backend, store, auth, navigation)\"\n2. \"WriteSharedTransactions: Write/refactor shared transaction page code for InventoryTracker (TransactionsPage, NewTransactionPage)\"\n\nHmm, but looking at the original subtask format: \"Unpack: Write app shared code for InventoryTracker\" - it uses the app name. Let me match that style.\n\nOK let me also consider whether I need per-page subtasks at all. The skill says:\n> 2. One subtask for each page to write/refactor shared code for each component on that page.\n\nIf I determine that no page components need to be shared, should I skip page subtasks entirely? The skill says \"If there are other apps\" → create subtasks with this structure. But if the shared code already exists, creating empty subtasks is wasteful.\n\nI think the spirit of the skill is: identify genuine shared code opportunities and create subtasks for them. If the shared code already exists, acknowledge that and create fewer subtasks.\n\nAfter analyzing the codebase, the shared patterns for app-wide logic, validation, and formatting already exist in `apps/shared/`, so InventoryTracker can reuse these modules without needing new shared code written. I need to follow the skill's guidance and create subtasks for shared code. I'll set up one app-wide subtask for backend logic and auth, then create individual page subtasks only where there's meaningful overlap—like AccountsPage which has reusable patterns for category sections and account lists, but skip DashboardPage since it has low overlap potential. 3. Transaction pages (TransactionsPage, TransactionDetailPage, NewTransactionPage)\n\nThat gives me 3 focused subtasks. I'm second-guessing whether I should follow the \"one subtask per page\" principle, but grouping related pages makes sense since they share the same patterns and existing code.
