Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

It seems like Netlify is trying to run a build step. The issue is likely the `netlify.toml` has a `[build]` section with `command = \"npm run build\"` and `base = \"apps/SupplierTracker\"`. Since we're already building locally with `vite build`, and then deploying with `netlify deploy --prod`, Netlify might be trying to run the build command as well.\n\nThe `netlify deploy --prod` command should skip the build step since we're deploying pre-built files. But the `netlify.toml` `base` directory might be confusing it. Let me check if there's a `--no-build` flag or if I should remove the build command from the `netlify.toml` temporarily, or adjust the deploy command.\n\n\nLooking at the error more closely, it appears the Netlify CLI is attempting to run a build step despite the manual deploy with pre-built files. The deploy script already handles the build with `vite build` and passes `--dir dist` to point to the pre-built output, so I need to figure out why Netlify is still trying to execute its own build command.\n\nThe problem could stem from the `base = \"apps/SupplierTracker\"` setting in netlify.toml conflicting with running the deploy from within the app directory, or the build command in the config overriding the manual deploy parameters. I should compare this with how InventoryTracker's netlify.toml is configured to see if there's a pattern I'm missing.","signature":"EtQNCkYICxgCKkBEdA1ykf9eA89c/+Etu4/lpb8iiwb3SzlGMlhaNYYOAoBoElFzoG6NPS+Wdv/IVonBHdX4DRjfeP4QDJF4y50wEgzBr8Ur3vFKqtxcoUkaDEjuYIlEoYC7I4NHJiIwrvb/igCkO2jPdTTawyTCreD1LLrgENYE9TpxUKZDmoIUyfd7rcE8e7EhUh7e0xC5KrsMyzr2HozmrrV8abcSyQ8z+BDp2/NN1ECgKUTgizrU0WTSIUPlTi789/smxFEvwGlW+uv4VOTkz+b9B4u/3s8hv88jPpCUYexB9qZvOCvQhbOXqjUeFdU7Ox8aqks/cL2gdLO/cVmXroImLv6LblJCMbX0x7TJ3CpZ9ByWpshbdE79zPjbmSYrSu450zSXlYywrvL4m+mHTH2mUYEKi1Qu1+8l3492WWB0BdwfqO6GkMCUesdlesqAcR9ll0s647wakS7SEBgcRwVpt+fifwByQt1xnKzbNKRZHmx19+YUuhV8JAQP1Wk0MthVpQUnEeBK1KhvPCMZzmhUDX0Cz089kPX3fuoeY7Td7qxCArv1YagEF1cHZEtiEYoZ2CtrE0Vfj9sfbua2Dc03TVEozoB5ardbmFayZvPDS0PaBcJ62hC1wezWgX4OSqj/Nc/FYsAMU93MQODzM1YpvkLgM37udld/RXe8wYSM+8H074zNi2GBUMhyiAu6rjPmttbmw9q+F9OdZ2Wp6h3i1aGYruOlWWiXC6Aat4DXgtlWpqVQS03Z0bKr/yWjXIAbz7lxAIYVz0gBnvklELoeDg8bh/yFjK0JHpne/ynzHGVhdAbQcb8YyfqofAXesN8GTNTP4/JCTFTFqE7UQXGi/Dl/q68DSBwD8e7+C8gcW6H8QLPztGa6jkf/gWNN8512nmN6cS+quuiEFCsqspttN14h2hSid4n/QT6+D1GK7sprjOVaEig/AhpB7RM8U78JjZxLA3ahpeUhxE81Dmv0VSbJFCtbAPExZ5imux53/ybuRxxo5e5z9o0FOm4Z5MqScRPuvaMkgX6HIZlf9mS5DwH9jqLQOS8dZZifeyIusxaNNVc9d8BjQk6EabhYVBhOBbIYtF1qmoTVcMfx6QqUTQtrjUFlwgYGXYYvta87pvofRbavLV01//UNjHE9gsv5PxumieU+kH9mB2XLk/V9PaCYLAuE6xyesbyBfRvTBQNn1SzG2YxqJI1BLXQT2KArP4dNyKKFlydYvwsYYR3EJXD+rPkUqN6y/CjZAfYC65NI9OmnKmAlKjHAqGUbTaydxjBtzdjfSMuc9fDRryD87GvFCF5rMKR57CSAxyHSBSsA6BK6hpVBCdJ2ATRGc2U30LnA9uCGS2NtunrNiJUv1V+zMdnSw0c2F/1A60LjwFzdSXuN2PMW5cFqg4z8W1AOJXO7RVV41EFEZMfY1P37L8CKEjrBkrExPiTUY1qwvI0qbyst6+ueGGOXqzyxQ64EVkREMoESUV+2fcSYFfoF2SfEFPro99YvhrbhiNj1OVFZdpN/Az4D+eeZzrCTx+Q5E4VDDrhPZ4h2OQBh8cHuyALwk7enuCl/q/0hsWTs4l+EsGuPV3T8Z5NyrAQh1jymaJpCdyS9sVWyMZPwNyLNn9jxvch87AdtR4H9TB+gQic9GS5DvTyQafg/MfqairuBBuJGNOprQtwbL3yWI2vovaFp+27SSNREwWbGA7AWJeOutMVwMfURB0qG8F8BsQ3HyR60xyWEjy5Uz1pDdyu7GMqWVPo6ybltYw7IMZ1QjlFQJ5t70HXWZsVSkz6yEMEfDh/n8Tgg/9xxmZPcXSkLYksZLXTksJ1o7lYSXfgJcbgV8J0rkZhcXxIdU6Q80jIoSCLJsLj20mh9pdrNaBlgR8OTgUUx9L4zoAXAgDQcqjwfg96lp91IvEww8r4o+0sBZ6h2eyIE/vMmcDohqHe/ptZgG5pcRUPWDOaMT/JYa4YgfE9iaj5q8NtYZtfu0ccr9Sie76FsFa7UiRvTFwDVFMpKnYH1n2EqxNzcTWRKBOXTg4joFaQSW+JuInupvaCTJhiVvexId1UNMVUuPe/nhoP6gqfup7OdK+m2UNhdevg0lzkog8Sn99UE7lt/CoXUgEWUA5nx2K3vHhUKgvPdvblBvp0Cyms73K8fN3EmEh9WFSFKl9vN2Zb4wTP+LLLo8eBUkurzFN8JJPd8keaZO1iMz2Xz+Y7tVs/5nlc4/66DUNLD3w6eZECmI+S/vjHyqzTYE53T3CmrEDkdPeXXY3smNuNqWxSXm0qUt/UR03vPYKccterKa5DmZ9oMnHrFw681xQcwwnqVkL7FqG12bPcYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3794,"cache_read_input_tokens":44785,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3794,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"20279107-4c77-483e-b966-2c8b24ec120e","uuid":"ea27e184-f953-4de7-877a-d43d385f9e7b"}

The other apps have similar setups, so there might be something specific to the CLI version or environment here.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":244,"cache_read_input_tokens":50221,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":244,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"20279107-4c77-483e-b966-2c8b24ec120e","uuid":"6536db9a-5e5b-4795-bd95-048d2968a0a2"}
