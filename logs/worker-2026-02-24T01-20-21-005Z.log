If so, add a note on the entry in\nbugReports.md but make no other changes.\n\nIf there is no directive against the bad behavior, add one or update any similar / conflicting directive.\nAdd a note on the entry in bugReports.md about the update made.\n\nDirectives should be general purpose and not include details or examples specific to the app being built.\n\n## Finishing bugs\n\nUpdate `docs/bugReports.md` to move the report from the \"Unreviewed\" section to the \"Finished\" section,\ncreating it at the end if necessary.\n\nMove the report from \"Unreviewed\" to \"Finished\" in `docs/bugReports.md`.\n","numLines":73,"startLine":1,"totalLines":73}}}

You will build and/or maintain one or more\\nweb apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\\n\\nKey directories:\\n\\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\\n* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\\n* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\\n  the work currently being done.\\n\\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\\n\\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\\n\\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\\n   whose name matches the user's request.\\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\\n\\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\\n\\n## Worker Execution\\n\\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\\n\\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\\n\\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\\n\\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\\n\\n## Job System\\n\\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\\nand a `timestamp`:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"groups\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"strategy\\\": \\\"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\\\",\\n      \\\"jobs\\\": [\\n        \\\"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\\\",\\n        \\\"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\\\",\\n        \\\"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\\n\\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \\\"<path>\\\" --job \\\"desc1\\\" --job \\\"desc2\\\"`**:\\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\\n\\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \\\"unpack\\\" into\\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\\n\\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\\n\\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\\n\\n## Tech Stack\\n\\n- **Vite** for build tooling\\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\\n- **Redux** for client side state management\\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`.

The previous worker iteration (fixBugReport.md strategy) found no `bugReports.md` file and concluded there were no open bug reports. However, I can see from the existing bug analysis docs (`apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugs/`) that three bugs were previously analyzed:\n\n1. SidebarNotRendering\n2. SidebarNavigationLinks\n3. RowActionMenu\n\nThese bugs were analyzed but the fixBugReport.md process was incomplete since `bugReports.md` never existed. The bug analysis docs exist in `docs/bugs/` from previous work.\n\nMy job is \"Unpack: Review fixed bug reports\" using the `reviewBugReport.md` strategy. The strategy says:\n\n\nSince `bugReports.md` doesn't exist, there are no unreviewed bug reports in the expected location, but the three bug analysis files suggest fixes were made without the tracking file being created. I should check the git history to understand what actually happened during the bug-fixing process. The existing bugs directory has analysis files, but I need to figure out if these bugs are actually fixed or not.\n\nLooking at the git log more carefully, these bugs were likely fixed during the initial app building and testing process rather than through the bugReport workflow. The bug analysis docs in `docs/bugs/` were probably created during the FixTests phase.\n\nSince `bugReports.md` doesn't exist, there are no unreviewed bug reports to process. I should create the file to establish the workflow, even if it starts empty. the system works properly going forward, but there's nothing to unpack right now.\n\nWait, but there ARE existing bugs in `docs/bugs/` that were analyzed and fixed. These bugs were never tracked through the `bugReports.md` system. The question is whether I should retroactively create the file and add these as unreviewed, or just note there's nothing to do.\n\nLooking at the context: the previous worker ran \"Unpack: Fix open bug reports\" using `fixBugReport.md` strategy, found no `bugReports.md` file, and completed with nothing to do. Then I'm running \"Unpack: Review fixed bug reports\" using `reviewBugReport.md` strategy. The bugs in `docs/bugs/` were created during the initial build process, not through the bug report workflow, which is designed for user-reported bugs tracked in `bugReports.md`. Since that file doesn't exist, there are no unreviewed bug reports to process, so I should create the file with proper structure and mark this as complete.

The bugs were fixed during the testing phase, not through the formal bug report workflow. There's no `bugReports.md` file.\n\nNow my job is \"Unpack: Review fixed bug reports\" following the `reviewBugReport.md` strategy. The strategy says:\n\n> After being fixed, bug reports from users in `docs/bugReports.md` go into an \"Unreviewed\" section.\n> These are then reviewed for improvements that can be made to the app building process.\n>\n> If there are any unreviewed bug reports in bugReports.md, add one group per bug\n\n\nSince the file doesn't exist, there are no bug reports to review according to the formal workflow. The bugs that were found and fixed during testing weren't captured through the user reporting process, so technically there's nothing to unpack here—I should signal that the task is complete. The bugs were actually discovered and fixed during the test-fixing phase as internal issues, not through the user bug report workflow, so the `bugReports.md` file was never created in the first place. Since the `reviewBugReport.md` strategy specifically handles reviewing bugs tracked in that file, and it doesn't exist, I need to figure out whether to create it with these completed bugs listed, or if there's nothing to review here since the bugs are already resolved. I'm realizing the job title \"Unpack: Review fixed bug reports\" suggests these bugs should exist in a formal tracking system, but `bugReports.md` was never created during the build process. I should create the file and add the three fixed bugs as \"Unreviewed\" entries so they can go through the proper review workflow and help improve future directives.","signature":"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
