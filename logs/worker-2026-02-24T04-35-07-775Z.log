Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files.

Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary.

This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":133,"startLine":1,"totalLines":133}}}

Systematically inventory every visible element — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows\n4. For every clickable element, test entry must specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. For data mutation actions, verify persistence and side effects (history/timeline entries, exactly once)\n6. Button/control appearance matters - verify specific text, icons, styling\n7. Completely test modal dialogs\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must test other parts of the app updating (timeline, reciprocal relationships)\n\nLet me check each component section:\n\n### DealsSummaryCards\n- **\"Summary cards display Total Active Deals count\"** - Has icon mention, label, count. OK.\n- **\"Summary cards display Pipeline Value\"** - Has icon, label, value. OK.\n- **\"Summary cards display Won Q3 count and value\"** - Has icon, label, count+value. OK.\n- **\"Summary cards display Lost Q3 count and value\"** - Has icon, label, count+value. OK.\n- **\"Summary cards update when deals data changes\"** - Tests side effect of creating a deal on summary cards. OK.\n\n### DealsViewTabs\n- **\"View tabs display Table View and Pipeline View options\"** - Specifies visual highlight. OK.\n- **\"Table View tab shows deals in table format\"** - Specifies columns and action menu. OK.\n- **\"Pipeline View tab shows deals in pipeline/board format\"** - Specifies active state, layout. OK.\n- **\"Switching back to Table View from Pipeline View\"** - Tests both directions. OK.\n\n### DealsFilters\n- **Stage, Client, Status, Date Range, Sort, Search** - All filter controls from the component list are tested. OK.\n- **\"Multiple filters combine correctly\"** - Tests combined filters. OK.\n- **\"Search input shows empty state\"** - Tests edge case. OK.\n- **\"Clearing search resets the filter\"** - Tests reset behavior. OK.\n\n### DealsTable\n- **\"Table displays all column headers\"** - Lists all columns. OK.\n- **\"Deal Name column displays deal names as clickable links\"** - Specifies navigation target (/deals/:dealId). OK per directive 4.\n- **\"Client column\"**, **\"Stage column\"**, **\"Owner column\"**, **\"Value column\"** - All display-only. OK.\n- **\"Close Date column displays date and supports sorting\"** - Tests sort interaction. OK.\n- **\"Status column shows color-coded badges\"** - Specifies each badge color. OK per directive 6.\n- **\"Row action menu opens with options\"** - Lists View Details, Edit, Delete. OK.\n- **\"Row action menu View Details navigates\"** - Specifies /deals/:dealId. OK per directive 4.\n- **\"Row action menu Edit opens edit dialog\"** - Tests edit + save. OK.\n- **\"Row action menu Edit dialog can be cancelled\"** - Tests cancel. OK per directive 7.\n- **\"Row action menu Delete with confirmation\"** - Tests confirm + cancel, side effects on summary cards and pagination. OK per directives 5, 7.\n- **\"Table shows empty state\"** - Tests empty state. OK.\n\n### CreateDealButton\n- **\"Create New Deal button is displayed as a blue primary button\"** - Specifies appearance. OK per directive 6.\n- **\"Create New Deal button opens creation dialog\"** - Specifies all form fields and field types (dropdowns, date picker, etc.). OK per directive 7.\n- **\"Create New Deal form validates required fields\"** - Tests validation. OK.\n- **\"Create New Deal form creates a deal successfully\"** - Tests all fields, success message, summary cards update, AND cross-page effect (deal appears in client's Deals section). OK per directives 5, 11.\n- **\"Create New Deal dialog can be cancelled\"** - Tests cancel. OK per directive 7.\n\n### Pagination\n- All pagination tests are present (display, next, previous, disabled states, filter reset). OK.\n\nNow let me check for potential violations:\n\n**Checking directive: \"Systematically inventory every visible element\"**\nThe component list mentions: DealsSummaryCards, DealsViewTabs, DealsFilters, DealsTable, CreateDealButton, Pagination. All are tested.\n\n**Checking directive: \"For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target\"**\n- Deal Name link → /deals/:dealId ✓\n- View Details → /deals/:dealId ✓ \n- Pipeline View tab → switches view ✓\n- Create New Deal button → opens dialog ✓\n\n**Checking directive: \"State-changing actions must test other parts of the app update\"**\n- Creating a deal updates summary cards ✓ and appears in client's Deals section ✓\n- Deleting a deal updates summary cards and pagination ✓\n\nLet me check if there's a timeline/history feature for deals.

Let me check line 418: \"And a timeline entry is created recording the deal creation\" - this is in a different test context (Client Detail Page). Let me check the create deal test entry again...\n\n\n- Looking at the actual test entry around lines 1197-1205, I see it covers the dialog closing, the deal appearing in the table, success message, summary cards updating, and the deal showing in the client's Deals section, but I don't see a timeline entry being created mentioned here either. I'm noticing the Deals List Page test doesn't verify that a timeline entry gets created when a deal is added, even though the Client Detail Page tests consistently check for timeline entries as side effects of data mutations. This looks like an inconsistency—the Deals List test checks that the deal appears on the Client Detail Page, but it's missing the timeline verification that should accompany any state-changing action.\n\nThe same gap appears in the delete test: it confirms the deal is removed from the table and summary cards update, but doesn't verify that a timeline entry is created for the deletion or that the client's Deals section reflects the change.\n\nFor the edit test, it only checks that the updated value appears in the deals table itself—it doesn't verify the change propagates to other pages like the client's Deals section, nor does it confirm a timeline entry is created.\n\nLooking back at what the timeline actually tracks on the Client Detail Page, I need to see what mutations should be generating history entries. I'm noticing an inconsistency in the spec—it mentions deal creation being tracked as a timeline event, but that's not listed in the actual timeline types. Regardless, the real issue is that the \"Create New Deal\" test doesn't verify a timeline entry is created on the client's timeline when a deal is added, which violates the directive about testing side effects for data mutations and cross-page state updates. changes, deal stage changes, and notes/writeups related to the client.\"\n\n\"deal stage changes\" are tracked in the timeline but \"deal creation\" per se may or may not be. However, the Client Detail Page tests explicitly test that creating a deal through the quick action creates a timeline entry (line 418). So if creating a deal from the Deals List Page should have the same side effect, then the test entry is missing it.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The test on the Client Detail Page (line 416-418) already covers that deal creation creates a timeline entry. The question is: should the DealsListPage test ALSO check for the timeline entry? In theory, the same backend endpoint is called, so the side effect should be the same regardless of where the deal is created. But per the directive, each mutation test should verify its side effects.\n\nI think the DealsListPage create deal test should also verify the timeline entry gets created. The delete test doesn't check that the client's Deals section updates after removal, which is another violation. And the edit test changes the deal value but doesn't verify whether that change shows up on the client detail page's Deals section either.\n\nLet me look more closely at the edit test—it opens the dialog and pre-populates the current deal data, then the user changes the value, but I need to see what happens after that change is submitted. entry. But if a deal's value changes, that should cascade to the Client Detail Page too—the client's deals section needs to reflect the update. Let me verify I have all the components mapped out correctly by reviewing the full list again.\n\nNow I'm checking the test coverage for each component: DealsSummaryCards, DealsViewTabs, DealsFilters, DealsTable, CreateDealButton, and Pagination all have their tests accounted for. But looking at the Pipeline View more closely, I notice the test only validates that deals appear in stage columns—it doesn't actually verify what information shows up on individual deal cards within that view.\n\nThe AppSpec mentions both table and pipeline/board layouts are possible, but the current test doesn't cover whether deal cards are clickable, where they navigate to, or whether drag-and-drop between stages is supported. This feels like a gap against the directive to systematically inventory every visible element and specify navigation targets for clickable items.\n\nSo I've identified two violations: the Pipeline View test lacks detail on card contents and interactions, violating directives 2 and 4, and the Create New Deal test doesn't verify that a timeline entry gets created on the client's timeline, which violates directive 5 on side effects.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether these are actually violations or if they're adequately covered elsewhere—the Client Detail Page test does verify timeline creation when a deal is created, so maybe the DealsListPage test doesn't need to duplicate that. But the directive is pretty clear that any data-mutating action needs to verify the change persists and that the right side effects occur, so I think both tests should cover this.\n\nThe Pipeline View issue seems like the clearest violation. For the other two, I'm realizing they're about ensuring each mutation test independently verifies side effects rather than relying on other tests to catch them.\n\nI'm also checking the DealsFilters component against the spec—all six controls (Stage, Client, Status, Date Range, Sort, and Search) have test coverage.\n\nLooking at DealsTable, all eight columns and the row action menu are tested as well.\n\nNow I'm considering the import/upload directive. The DealsListPage doesn't appear to have an import feature like ClientsListPage does, so that requirement wouldn't apply here.\n\nThe backend integration directive about webhooks and API configurations also doesn't seem relevant to this page.\n\nAttachment functionality is mentioned in the requirements, but that's handled on the DealDetailPage, not here.\n\nThere's one potential issue though: deals have client associations, so when a deal is created or deleted, the client's deals list should reflect that change. The test covers this for creation, but not for deletion.\n\nLet me go through the test entries systematically to identify any clear violations...\n\nThe pipeline view test only describes the layout structure but doesn't specify what information appears on each deal card or whether they're interactive. That's missing details about visible elements and navigation targets. The delete action test verifies the summary updates but doesn't check if the deal disappears from the client's deals section. And the create deal test confirms the deal shows up in the client's section but doesn't verify a timeline entry is created.\n\nLooking at the spec more carefully, the timeline is supposed to track deal stage changes, and the Client Detail test explicitly expects a timeline entry when a deal is created. So both the create and delete tests should verify timeline updates. Though deletion is trickier since the timeline types don't explicitly mention \"deal deleted\" — I'm only going to flag what's clearly required by the spec.\n\nThe dialog tests look solid: the Edit test covers opening with pre-populated data, editing, and canceling; the Create test covers opening, field validation, successful creation, and canceling. Both seem complete.\n\nNow I need to verify one more thing about the clickable elements directive — making sure every button and navigation target is explicitly specified, especially for external flows like OAuth or payment systems.\n\nGoing through the clickable elements: deal name links go to the deal detail page, view tabs switch between views, filters and sorting modify the table, the row action menu opens a dropdown, View Details navigates to the deal page, Edit and Delete open dialogs, Create New Deal opens a dialog, and pagination changes the page. Everything has a clear action specified.\n\nI should also verify that the Pipeline View test covers all the elements that would appear there — deal cards grouped by stage columns, with each card showing the deal name, value, client, and status.\n\nLooking at the test entries, the Pipeline View tests don't actually specify what's on those deal cards or what happens when you interact with them. That's a gap against the requirements.\n\nLet me identify the concrete violations I can confirm: the Pipeline View tests are missing details about card contents and interactions, the Create New Deal test doesn't verify that a timeline entry gets created on the client record, and the Delete action doesn't verify that the deal disappears from the client's Deals section or timeline. These three issues could all be fixed by adding more detail to the existing test entries in the docs.\n\nNow I'm moving to Job 2, which is checking the DealsListPage components themselves. But here's the thing — there's no DealsListPage code in the codebase at all, so there are no components to evaluate against the directives. The page simply hasn't been implemented yet. The checkDirectives strategy is about finding violations in existing code against the requirements, not about flagging missing implementations, so I need to think about whether a non-existent page counts as a violation or if I should just note that there's nothing to check. For the test job, the same logic applies — there are no test files for DealsListPage yet, so there's nothing to check against the directives. The absence of implementation isn't a violation of the directives themselves, just a gap in what's been built. Let me move forward with what actually exists to review.\n\nNow looking more closely at the Pipeline View test spec, I notice it's pretty vague about the actual implementation details. The test describes the visual behavior of switching tabs and that deals appear in a pipeline layout grouped by stage, but it doesn't specify which stage columns should exist, what data each deal card displays, or whether those cards are interactive. That's a significant gap in the specification that would need clarification before implementation. Now I'm organizing these violations into fix groups based on their root causes. The Pipeline View test entries need updates for card details and clickability, while the mutation tests are missing cross-page side effect verification—these are distinct issues, so I'll create two separate fix groups to address them.\n\nLooking at the strategy template and existing commits, I'm realizing these are test spec violations that only require documentation updates, not code changes or test runs. The fix structure might need to be simpler than the standard template suggests.\n\nActually, thinking through the cascade effect — when test entries in docs/tests.md change, the corresponding app code and tests downstream may need updates too. So I should structure the fix groups to account for that dependency chain, starting with the test spec updates and then addressing any related code changes

Let me systematically check each DealsListPage test entry against testSpec.md directives.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecDealsListPage\n\nChecking each component section against testSpec.md directives:\n\n### Checking DealsSummaryCards (5 tests)\n- \"Summary cards display Total Active Deals count\" — has icon, label, count. **OK**\n- \"Summary cards display Pipeline Value\" — has icon, label, value. **OK**\n- \"Summary cards display Won Q3 count and value\" — has icon, label, format. **OK**\n- \"Summary cards display Lost Q3 count and value\" — has icon, label, format. **OK**\n- \"Summary cards update when deals data changes\" — tests mutation side effect. **OK**\n\n### Checking DealsViewTabs (4 tests)\n- \"View tabs display Table View and Pipeline View options\" — specifies active visual highlight. **OK**\n- \"Table View tab shows deals in table format\" — specifies columns and action menu. **OK**\n- \"Pipeline View tab shows deals in pipeline/board format\" — **VIOLATION**: Only says \"deals are displayed in a pipeline/board layout grouped by deal stage columns\" but does NOT:\n  - Specify which stage columns are displayed (e.g., Lead, Qualification, Discovery, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won)\n  - Specify what information each deal card shows (name, value, client, status badge, etc.)\n  - Specify whether deal cards are clickable and what navigation target they have\n  - This violates directive 2 (\"Systematically inventory every visible element\") and directive 4 (\"For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target\")\n- \"Switching back to Table View from Pipeline View\" — **OK**\n\n### Checking DealsFilters (9 tests)\n- \"Stage dropdown filters by deal stage\" — specifies stages, default, reset. **OK**\n- \"Client dropdown filters by associated client\" — specifies clients, default, reset. **OK**\n- \"Status dropdown filters by deal status\" — specifies statuses, default, reset. **OK**\n- \"Date Range picker filters by close date range\" — specifies date range interaction. **OK**\n- \"Sort by dropdown changes table ordering\" — specifies all sort options. **OK**\n- \"Search input filters deals by name\" — specifies placeholder, filter behavior. **OK**\n- \"Search input shows empty state when no results match\" — specifies empty state. **OK**\n- \"Clearing search resets the filter\" — specifies reset. **OK**\n- \"Multiple filters combine correctly\" — tests combined filters. **OK**\n\n### Checking DealsTable (13 tests)\n- \"Table displays all column headers\" — lists all 7 columns + action menu. **OK**\n- \"Deal Name column displays deal names as clickable links\" — navigates to /deals/:dealId. **OK** per directive 4\n- \"Client column displays associated client name\" — display only. **OK**\n- \"Stage column displays deal stage\" — with examples. **OK**\n- \"Owner column displays deal owner name\" — abbreviated format. **OK**\n- \"Value column displays deal monetary value\" — currency format. **OK**\n- \"Close Date column displays date and supports sorting\" — sort indicator, click sort. **OK**\n- \"Status column shows color-coded badges\" — specifies each color per status. **OK** per directive 6\n- \"Row action menu opens with options\" — lists options. **OK**\n- \"Row action menu View Details navigates to deal detail\" — /deals/:dealId. **OK**\n- \"Row action menu Edit opens edit dialog\" — pre-populated fields, save works. **OK**\n- \"Row action menu Edit dialog can be cancelled\" — cancel works, no changes. **OK** per directive 7\n- \"Row action menu Delete with confirmation\" — **VIOLATION**: Verifies summary cards and pagination update, but does NOT verify the deal is removed from the associated client's Deals section on the Client Detail Page. This violates directive 11 (\"State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately\").\n- \"Table shows empty state\" — **OK**\n\n### Checking CreateDealButton (4 tests)\n- \"Create New Deal button is displayed as a blue primary button\" — appearance specified. **OK** per directive 6\n- \"Create New Deal button opens creation dialog\" — all fields specified. **OK** per directive 7\n- \"Create New Deal form validates required fields\" — validation tested. **OK**\n- \"Create New Deal form creates a deal successfully\" — **VIOLATION**: Verifies deal appears in client's Deals section, but does NOT verify that a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline. The Client Detail Page tests (line 418) establish that deal creation should create a timeline entry — so this test should verify it too. Violates directive 5 (\"verify persistence and exactly the right side effects\") and directive 11 (\"timeline tracking\").\n- \"Create New Deal dialog can be cancelled\" — **OK** per directive 7\n\n### Checking Pagination (6 tests)\n- \"Pagination displays current page information\" — **OK**\n- \"Clicking Next page loads the next set of deals\" — **OK**\n- \"Clicking Previous page loads the previous set of deals\" — **OK**\n- \"Previous button is disabled on first page\" — **OK**\n- \"Next button is disabled on last page\" — **OK**\n- \"Pagination resets when filters change\" — **OK**\n\n### Summary of testSpec.md violations found:\n\n1. **Pipeline View test entries lack deal card details** — No specification of stage column names, deal card contents, or card clickability/navigation targets (directives 2, 4)\n2. **Create deal test missing timeline side effect** — \"Create New Deal form creates a deal successfully\" doesn't verify a timeline entry is created on the client (directives 5, 11)\n3. **Delete deal test missing client Deals section update** — \"Row action menu Delete with confirmation\" doesn't verify the deal is removed from the client's Deals section (directive 11)\n\nNow let me add fix groups for these violations."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2968,"cache_read_input_tokens":44215,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2968,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"90385a4f-179f-4f07-af7a-bc0f985e7e49","uuid":"b503f57c-d73e-43c7-a0ae-7f4d16471fcb"}
