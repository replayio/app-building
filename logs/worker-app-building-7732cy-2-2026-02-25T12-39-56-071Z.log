Let me check - my sorted list already includes it. The last group has only 4 files including the 7732cy one.\n\nNow I need to queue these tasks in REVERSE order so that group 1 is at the front after all are added (since each add-task puts the task at the front). Actually wait - the skill says to queue at the FRONT of the queue. If I add them in order, the last group added will be at the front. So I should add them in reverse order so that group 1 ends up at the front.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully, all the AnalyzeGroup tasks are independent - it doesn't matter what order they're processed. \n\nNow I'm going through the add-task commands. Looking back at the Unpack instructions, they only specify queuing the AnalyzeGroup subtasks - there's no synthesis step mentioned, so I'll just queue those groups and be done.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6815,"cache_read_input_tokens":33730,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6815,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bfbdb205-a98e-40a7-a927-4fd27a707600","uuid":"680f4db9-410a-4564-8839-46c7df4ec560"}
