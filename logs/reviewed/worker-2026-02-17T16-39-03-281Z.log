No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    21→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    22→- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    23→\n    24→## Directives\n    25→\n    26→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    27→\n    28→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    29→\n    30→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    31→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    32→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    33→\n    34→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    35→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    36→  not the git repository root.\n    37→\n    38→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    39→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    40→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    41→\n    42→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    43→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    44→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    45→\n    46→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    47→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    48→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    49→\n    50→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    51→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    52→\n    53→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    54→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    55→  to the same destination.\n    56→\n    57→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    58→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    59→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    60→\n    61→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    62→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    63→  icon for all attachment types.\n    64→\n    65→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

Scaffold in a temp directory\n    71→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n    72→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n    73→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n    74→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n    75→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n    76→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n    77→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n    78→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n    79→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n    80→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n    81→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n    82→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n    83→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n    84→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n    85→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n    86→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n    87→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n    88→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n    89→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n    90→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n    91→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n    92→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01TNMDbp9zknM5nF97t1KS8f","session_id":"ea780c21-dd76-4158-a0db-c55297864d38","uuid":"b175b7cd-f824-4f21-9441-62def740a32d"}

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    20→\n    21→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    22→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    23→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    24→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    25→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    26→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    27→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    28→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    29→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    30→\n    31→## Directives\n    32→\n    33→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    34→\n    35→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    36→\n    37→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    38→\n    39→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\n    40→\n    41→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    42→\n    43→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    44→\n    45→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    46→\n    47→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    48→\n    49→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    50→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    51→\n    52→## Tips\n    53→\n    54→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    55→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    56→- When starting from scratch with no existing plan.md, create and commit plan.md before moving on\n    57→  to PlanPage tasks. This avoids losing the plan if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    58→- The PlanPages task must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    59→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    60→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    61→  plan.md, commit, and exit. A zero-commit iteration is always a failure — prioritize writing\n    62→  output over exhaustive exploration.\n    63→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

Now let me create a comprehensive summary document. Based on all the files I've read, here's the complete authentication system overview:\n\n## SalesCRM Authentication System Overview\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the SalesCRM app's authentication system. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Frontend Architecture**\n\n#### Main Entry Point (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx`)\n- Auth library is imported first to patch `window.fetch` before any other code runs\n- AuthProvider wraps the entire app inside Redux Store and BrowserRouter\n- Application initialization order: Store → Router → AuthProvider → App\n\n#### App Routing (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`)\n- Public routes:\n  - `/login` - LoginPage\n  - `/register` - RegisterPage\n  - `/auth/callback` - AuthCallbackPage (OAuth callback handler)\n- Protected routes wrapped in `<RequireAuth>` component:\n  - `/clients` - ClientsListPage\n  - `/clients/:clientId` - ClientDetailPage\n  - `/individuals/:individualId` - PersonDetailPage\n  - `/deals` - DealsListPage\n  - `/deals/:dealId` - DealDetailPage\n  - `/tasks` - TasksListPage\n  - `/tasks/:taskId` - TaskDetailPage\n\n#### Authentication Provider (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`)\n- **Context Value Interface:**\n  - `isLoggedIn: boolean`\n  - `loading: boolean`\n  - `user: { id, email, name, avatar_url } | null`\n  - `signOut: () => Promise<void>`\n\n- **Session Management:**\n  - Checks Supabase session via `auth.getSession()`\n  - Falls back to localStorage check for test mode (supports token stored at: `sb-{subdomain}-auth-token`)\n  - Sets up auth state listener via `auth.onAuthStateChange()`\n  - Fetches user info via Redux query `useGetUserInfoQuery` only if logged in\n\n- **Key Hook:**\n  - `useAuth()` - returns AuthContextValue for any component to access auth state\n\n#### Auth Library (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/lib/auth.ts`)\n- **Supabase Configuration:**\n  - URL: `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL` (https://auth.nut.new)\n  - Anon Key: `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`\n  - Creates Supabase client and exports `auth` (Supabase Auth client)\n\n- **Fetch Interceptor:**\n  - Patches `window.fetch` globally to automatically inject `Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}` header\n  - Only applies to `/.netlify/functions/` endpoints\n  - Tries Supabase session first, falls back to localStorage for test mode\n  - Enables seamless auth token passing to backend functions\n\n#### Authorization Guard (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/auth/RequireAuth.tsx`)\n- Checks `isLoggedIn` and `loading` from AuthProvider\n- Shows loading message while checking auth\n- Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated\n- Renders protected content via `<Outlet />` if authenticated\n\n#### Login Page (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/Login.tsx`)\n- **Two authentication methods:**\n  1. Email/Password login: `auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })`\n  2. Google OAuth: Redirects to `https://auth.nut.new/functions/v1/oauth/start?provider=google&redirect_to={callbackUrl}`\n- Error handling and loading states\n- Link to register page\n\n#### Register Page (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/Register.tsx`)\n- **Email/Password registration:**\n  - `auth.signUp({ email, password, options: { data: { full_name: name } } })`\n- **Google OAuth signup:** Same redirect as login\n- Post-signup confirmation: Shows \"Check your email\" message\n- Error handling and loading states\n\n#### Auth Callback Page (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx`)\n- Simple redirect component\n- Waits 1 second, then navigates to `/`\n- Supabase auto-detects tokens in URL hash via `onAuthStateChange`\n\n#### Sidebar Navigation (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`)\n- Displays user info (avatar, name) from `useAuth()`\n- Shows navigation: Clients, Deals, Tasks\n- Sign out button calls `signOut()` from AuthProvider\n\n#### Redux Auth Slice (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/authSlice.ts`)\n- **Two Redux Query endpoints:**\n  1. `getSession`: Fetches current Supabase session and returns access_token\n  2. `getUserInfo`: RTK Query to `/.netlify/functions/getUserInfo`\n- Provides tags for cache invalidation: `['Session', 'UserInfo']`\n\n### 2. **Backend Architecture**\n\n#### Auth Middleware (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/auth.ts`)\n- **Two JWT verification modes:**\n  1. **Test Mode** (`IS_TEST=true`):\n     - Uses fixed EC P-256 test key pair\n     - Verifies JWT locally with `jose.jwtVerify(token, testPublicKey)`\n     - Private key for signing: embedded in code\n  \n  2. **Production Mode**:\n     - Fetches JWKS from: `https://auth.nut.new/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`\n     - Verifies JWT with remote key set\n     - Validates issuer: `https://auth.nut.new/auth/v1`\n\n- **Token Validation:**\n  - Extracts Bearer token from `Authorization` header\n  - Returns 401 if missing or invalid\n\n- **User Provisioning:**\n  - Extracts from JWT payload:\n    - `sub` (subject) → auth_user_id\n    - `email`\n    - `user_metadata.full_name` or `user_metadata.name` → name\n    - `app_metadata.provider` → provider\n    - `user_metadata.avatar_url` → avatar_url\n  - Uses Neon PostgreSQL serverless client\n  - **Upsert logic:** Inserts or updates user in `users` table:\n    ```sql\n    INSERT INTO users (auth_user_id, email, name, provider, avatar_url)\n    VALUES (...)\n    ON CONFLICT (auth_user_id) DO UPDATE SET\n      email = EXCLUDED.email,\n      name = EXCLUDED.name,\n      provider = EXCLUDED.provider,\n      avatar_url = EXCLUDED.avatar_url,\n      updated_at = NOW()\n    ```\n  - Returns `UserRecord` interface with: `id, auth_user_id, email, name, avatar_url, provider`\n\n- **Middleware Decorator:**\n  - `requiresAuth(handler)` - Higher-order function wrapping all protected endpoints\n  - Extends request with `user` property of type `UserRecord`\n  - Returns 401 JSON if auth fails\n\n#### getUserInfo Function (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/getUserInfo.ts`)\n- Protected endpoint (wrapped with `requiresAuth`)\n- Returns logged-in user info from request context:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"id\": \"...\",\n    \"email\": \"...\",\n    \"name\": \"...\",\n    \"avatar_url\": \"...\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### Other Protected Functions (`clients.ts`, `deals.ts`, etc.)\n- All wrapped with `requiresAuth(handler)`\n- Access authenticated user via `req.user`\n- Example from `clients.ts` line 176: `user_name` field populated from `req.user.name`\n- Database queries scoped to authenticated context\n\n### 3. **Environment Variables** (`.env`)\n```\nDATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # Neon PostgreSQL serverless\nVITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL=https://auth.nut.new\nVITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...\n```\n\n### 4. **Data Flow Diagram**\n\n```\nUser Login (Email/Password or Google)\n    ↓\nSupabase Auth (auth.nut.new)\n    ↓\nJWT Token generated\n    ↓\nAuthCallback redirects with token in URL hash\n    ↓\nSupabase client auto-detects token via onAuthStateChange\n    ↓\nAuthProvider updates context (isLoggedIn=true, user info)\n    ↓\nfetch() interceptor auto-adds Authorization header\n    ↓\nNetlify Function receives request\n    ↓\nrequiresAuth middleware verifies JWT & provisions user\n    ↓\nHandler accesses req.user with user info\n    ↓\nResponse includes user context\n```\n\n### 5. **Key Security Features**\n\n1. **Token Auto-Injection**: Fetch interceptor automatically includes Bearer token\n2. **JWT Verification**: Production uses remote JWKS, test mode uses fixed keys\n3. **User Provisioning**: Automatic user sync on first authenticated request\n4. **Bearer Token Required**: All protected endpoints reject requests without valid token\n5. **Fallback Mechanism**: Test mode supports localStorage token injection for testing\n6. **Upsert Pattern**: Prevents duplicate user records on re-authentication\n\n### 6. **File Paths Summary**\n\n| Component | Path |\n|-----------|------|\n| App Routing | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` |\n| Auth Provider | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx` |\n| Auth Library (fetch interceptor) | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/lib/auth.ts` |\n| Login Page | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/Login.tsx` |\n| Register Page | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/Register.tsx` |\n| Auth Callback | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` |\n| RequireAuth Guard | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/auth/RequireAuth.tsx` |\n| Sidebar (user info) | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` |\n| Auth Redux Slice | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/authSlice.ts` |\n| Backend Auth Middleware | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/auth.ts` |\n| getUserInfo Function | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/getUserInfo.ts` |\n| Protected API Functions | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts`, `deals.ts`, etc. |\n| Entry Point | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx` |\n| Redux Store | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/index.ts` |\n| API Config | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/appApi.ts` |\n| Env Config | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/.env` |"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a231073 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 35195\ntool_uses: 25\nduration_ms: 44496</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ea780c21-dd76-4158-a0db-c55297864d38","uuid":"fa7e9f88-66cd-4868-856c-d7557e22b382","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the SalesCRM app's authentication system.

Here's a comprehensive breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Frontend Architecture**\n\n#### Main Entry Point (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx`)\n- Auth library is imported first to patch `window.fetch` before any other code runs\n- AuthProvider wraps the entire app inside Redux Store and BrowserRouter\n- Application initialization order: Store → Router → AuthProvider → App\n\n#### App Routing (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`)\n- Public routes:\n  - `/login` - LoginPage\n  - `/register` - RegisterPage\n  - `/auth/callback` - AuthCallbackPage (OAuth callback handler)\n- Protected routes wrapped in `<RequireAuth>` component:\n  - `/clients` - ClientsListPage\n  - `/clients/:clientId` - ClientDetailPage\n  - `/individuals/:individualId` - PersonDetailPage\n  - `/deals` - DealsListPage\n  - `/deals/:dealId` - DealDetailPage\n  - `/tasks` - TasksListPage\n  - `/tasks/:taskId` - TaskDetailPage\n\n#### Authentication Provider (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`)\n- **Context Value Interface:**\n  - `isLoggedIn: boolean`\n  - `loading: boolean`\n  - `user: { id, email, name, avatar_url } | null`\n  - `signOut: () => Promise<void>`\n\n- **Session Management:**\n  - Checks Supabase session via `auth.getSession()`\n  - Falls back to localStorage check for test mode (supports token stored at: `sb-{subdomain}-auth-token`)\n  - Sets up auth state listener via `auth.onAuthStateChange()`\n  - Fetches user info via Redux query `useGetUserInfoQuery` only if logged in\n\n- **Key Hook:**\n  - `useAuth()` - returns AuthContextValue for any component to access auth state\n\n#### Auth Library (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/lib/auth.ts`)\n- **Supabase Configuration:**\n  - URL: `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL` (https://auth.nut.new)\n  - Anon Key: `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`\n  - Creates Supabase client and exports `auth` (Supabase Auth client)\n\n- **Fetch Interceptor:**\n  - Patches `window.fetch` globally to automatically inject `Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}` header\n  - Only applies to `/.netlify/functions/` endpoints\n  - Tries Supabase session first, falls back to localStorage for test mode\n  - Enables seamless auth token passing to backend functions\n\n#### Authorization Guard (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/auth/RequireAuth.tsx`)\n- Checks `isLoggedIn` and `loading` from AuthProvider\n- Shows loading message while checking auth\n- Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated\n- Renders protected content via `<Outlet />` if authenticated\n\n#### Login Page (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/Login.tsx`)\n- **Two authentication methods:**\n  1. Email/Password login: `auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })`\n  2. Google OAuth: Redirects to `https://auth.nut.new/functions/v1/oauth/start?provider=google&redirect_to={callbackUrl}`\n- Error handling and loading states\n- Link to register page\n\n#### Register Page (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/Register.tsx`)\n- **Email/Password registration:**\n  - `auth.signUp({ email, password, options: { data: { full_name: name } } })`\n- **Google OAuth signup:** Same redirect as login\n- Post-signup confirmation: Shows \"Check your email\" message\n- Error handling and loading states\n\n#### Auth Callback Page (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx`)\n- Simple redirect component\n- Waits 1 second, then navigates to `/`\n- Supabase auto-detects tokens in URL hash via `onAuthStateChange`\n\n#### Sidebar Navigation (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`)\n- Displays user info (avatar, name) from `useAuth()`\n- Shows navigation: Clients, Deals, Tasks\n- Sign out button calls `signOut()` from AuthProvider\n\n#### Redux Auth Slice (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/authSlice.ts`)\n- **Two Redux Query endpoints:**\n  1. `getSession`: Fetches current Supabase session and returns access_token\n  2. `getUserInfo`: RTK Query to `/.netlify/functions/getUserInfo`\n- Provides tags for cache invalidation: `['Session', 'UserInfo']`\n\n### 2. **Backend Architecture**\n\n#### Auth Middleware (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/auth.ts`)\n- **Two JWT verification modes:**\n  1. **Test Mode** (`IS_TEST=true`):\n     - Uses fixed EC P-256 test key pair\n     - Verifies JWT locally with `jose.jwtVerify(token, testPublicKey)`\n     - Private key for signing: embedded in code\n  \n  2. **Production Mode**:\n     - Fetches JWKS from: `https://auth.nut.new/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`\n     - Verifies JWT with remote key set\n     - Validates issuer: `https://auth.nut.new/auth/v1`\n\n- **Token Validation:**\n  - Extracts Bearer token from `Authorization` header\n  - Returns 401 if missing or invalid\n\n- **User Provisioning:**\n  - Extracts from JWT payload:\n    - `sub` (subject) → auth_user_id\n    - `email`\n    - `user_metadata.full_name` or `user_metadata.name` → name\n    - `app_metadata.provider` → provider\n    - `user_metadata.avatar_url` → avatar_url\n  - Uses Neon PostgreSQL serverless client\n  - **Upsert logic:** Inserts or updates user in `users` table:\n    ```sql\n    INSERT INTO users (auth_user_id, email, name, provider, avatar_url)\n    VALUES (...)\n    ON CONFLICT (auth_user_id) DO UPDATE SET\n      email = EXCLUDED.email,\n      name = EXCLUDED.name,\n      provider = EXCLUDED.provider,\n      avatar_url = EXCLUDED.avatar_url,\n      updated_at = NOW()\n    ```\n  - Returns `UserRecord` interface with: `id, auth_user_id, email, name, avatar_url, provider`\n\n- **Middleware Decorator:**\n  - `requiresAuth(handler)` - Higher-order function wrapping all protected endpoints\n  - Extends request with `user` property of type `UserRecord`\n  - Returns 401 JSON if auth fails\n\n#### getUserInfo Function (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/getUserInfo.ts`)\n- Protected endpoint (wrapped with `requiresAuth`)\n- Returns logged-in user info from request context:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"id\": \"...\",\n    \"email\": \"...\",\n    \"name\": \"...\",\n    \"avatar_url\": \"...\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n#### Other Protected Functions (`clients.ts`, `deals.ts`, etc.)\n- All wrapped with `requiresAuth(handler)`\n- Access authenticated user via `req.user`\n- Example from `clients.ts` line 176: `user_name` field populated from `req.user.name`\n- Database queries scoped to authenticated context\n\n### 3. **Environment Variables** (`.env`)\n```\nDATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # Neon PostgreSQL serverless\nVITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL=https://auth.nut.new\nVITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...\n```\n\n### 4. **Data Flow Diagram**\n\n```\nUser Login (Email/Password or Google)\n    ↓\nSupabase Auth (auth.nut.new)\n    ↓\nJWT Token generated\n    ↓\nAuthCallback redirects with token in URL hash\n    ↓\nSupabase client auto-detects token via onAuthStateChange\n    ↓\nAuthProvider updates context (isLoggedIn=true, user info)\n    ↓\nfetch() interceptor auto-adds Authorization header\n    ↓\nNetlify Function receives request\n    ↓\nrequiresAuth middleware verifies JWT & provisions user\n    ↓\nHandler accesses req.user with user info\n    ↓\nResponse includes user context\n```\n\n### 5. **Key Security Features**\n\n1. **Token Auto-Injection**: Fetch interceptor automatically includes Bearer token\n2. **JWT Verification**: Production uses remote JWKS, test mode uses fixed keys\n3. **User Provisioning**: Automatic user sync on first authenticated request\n4. **Bearer Token Required**: All protected endpoints reject requests without valid token\n5. **Fallback Mechanism**: Test mode supports localStorage token injection for testing\n6. **Upsert Pattern**: Prevents duplicate user records on re-authentication\n\n### 6. **File Paths Summary**\n\n| Component | Path |\n|-----------|------|\n| App Routing | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` |\n| Auth Provider | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx` |\n| Auth Library (fetch interceptor) | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/lib/auth.ts` |\n| Login Page | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/Login.tsx` |\n| Register Page | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/Register.tsx` |\n| Auth Callback | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` |\n| RequireAuth Guard | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/auth/RequireAuth.tsx` |\n| Sidebar (user info) | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` |\n| Auth Redux Slice | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/authSlice.ts` |\n| Backend Auth Middleware | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/auth.ts` |\n| getUserInfo Function | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/getUserInfo.ts` |\n| Protected API Functions | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts`, `deals.ts`, etc. |\n| Entry Point | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx` |\n| Redux Store | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/index.ts` |\n| API Config | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/appApi.ts` |\n| Env Config | `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/.env` |"}],"totalDurationMs":44496,"totalTokens":35195,"totalToolUseCount":25,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":717,"cache_read_input_tokens":31743,"output_tokens":2734,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":717},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

STRATEGIES/MESSAGES/ DIRECTORY - ALL FILES\n\n**Location:** `/repo/strategies/messages/`\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| **addBugReport.md** | Strategy for adding user bug reports to `docs/bugReports.md`. Describes how to identify app, format reports using M/D/YYYY dates and clear one-line descriptions, and preserve user wording. |\n| **maintainApp.md** | High-level maintenance workflow: (1) fixBugReport.md, (2) reviewBugReport.md, (3) checkDirectives.md, (4) polishApp.md, (5) deployment.md. Describes creating maintenance round tasks in plan.md. |\n| **buildInitialApp.md** | Strategy for initial app building: (1) testSpec.md, (2) writeApp.md, (3) writeTests.md, (4) testing.md, (5) deployment.md. |\n| **analyzeLogs.md** | Instructions for reading logs using `npm run read-log` (not raw file read). Details where logs live and how to analyze them. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. STRATEGIES/TASKS/ DIRECTORY - ALL FILES\n\n**Location:** `/repo/strategies/tasks/`\n\n### Task Files:\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| **performTasks.md** | **CRITICAL WORKFLOW**: Processes pending tasks in docs/plan.md. Main agent loop: (1) Check for worker logs, (2) Read plan.md, (3) Pick next task, (4) Implement, (5) Commit after changes, (6) Exit for next iteration. |\n| **reviewChanges.md** | Strategy for processing worker logs to understand recent changes and their impacts. |\n| **deployment.md** | Deployment stage: deploy to production, test with Playwright and Replay. Requires `npm run deploy` support. |\n\n### Build Strategy Subdirectory (`strategies/tasks/build/`):\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| **testSpec.md** | Create docs/tests.md with comprehensive test entries for all pages/components. Directives: match mockups precisely, inventory all visible elements, test every clickable element, verify side effects, test modals completely. |\n| **writeApp.md** | Write database and application code. **Extensive directives** (28 items): use data-testid on interactive elements, Neon SQL with tagged templates, treat empty strings as null, no native `<select>` elements, custom dropdowns required, file-type-specific attachment icons, file upload support, searchable selects for entity references, no duplicate nav links. |\n| **writeTests.md** | Write Playwright tests matching test entries. Directives: verify navigation targets precisely, assert side effects (no duplicates), use getByTestId not getByText with common words, verify file upload mechanics not URL substitutes. |\n| **testing.md** | Run tests, debug failures, ensure all tests pass. |\n\n### Maintain Strategy Subdirectory (`strategies/tasks/maintain/`):\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| **fixBugReport.md** | Fix open bugs from docs/bugReports.md. Workflow: (1) AnalyzeBug (using Replay MCP if needed), (2) FixBug, (3) UpdateTests, (4) UpdateRevisions, (5) ResolveBug. Create docs/bugs/<BugName>.md analysis files. |\n| **reviewBugReport.md** | Classify fixed bugs to identify build stage problems. Determine if issue is in testSpec.md, writeApp.md, writeTests.md, or no problem stage (new functionality). Update directives if needed. Move bugs to \"Finished\" section. |\n| **checkDirectives.md** | Systematically verify all app code follows directives from build strategy files. For each page: check test spec violations, component violations, test violations. Also check backend. Create fix tasks, run tests, document fixes. |\n| **polishApp.md** | Polish app quality (appearance, performance, structure). Currently a **stub with no subtasks**. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.

KEY FEATURES AND CURRENT STATE\n\n### Completed Features (4 Maintenance Rounds):\n\n1. **Maintenance Round 1**: Fixed directive violations (Neon SQL, testids, searchable selects, dynamic SQL)\n2. **Maintenance Round 2**: Fixed 6 bugs (attachment previews, dropdown styling, task detail page, sidebar cleanup)\n3. **Maintenance Round 3**: Fixed 24 native select elements → custom FilterSelect component\n4. **Maintenance Round 4**: Fixed 4 bugs (deal attachment uploads, pipeline drag-drop, task links, **Supabase authentication**)\n\n### Current Open Bug:\n\n**2/17/2026**: SSO popup opens in same window (breaking flow). Authentication should be optional. Need current user info area in upper left with sign-out.\n\n### Technology Stack:\n- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, TypeScript (strict), Redux, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS\n- **Backend**: Netlify Functions, Neon Postgres, Supabase Auth\n- **File Storage**: UploadThing\n- **Testing**: Playwright (183 tests passing)\n- **Deployment**: Netlify\n\n---\n\n## 5. CRITICAL STRATEGY PATTERNS\n\n### Bug Report Workflow:\n1. User reports bug → addBugReport.md adds to docs/bugReports.md (Open section)\n2. maintainApp.md initiates maintenance round → fixBugReport.md fixes bugs\n3. reviewBugReport.md classifies to problem stage\n4. checkDirectives.md verifies directives followed\n5. deployment.md deploys to production\n\n### Code Quality Gates (from performTasks.md):\n- `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass\n- `npx eslint .` must pass\n- No commits without passing quality gates\n\n### Task Execution Model:\n- Plan.md contains all pending tasks\n- Each task has format: \"StrategyFile: TaskName: Description\"\n- After each task: commit → exit → next iteration with fresh context\n- Worker loop in AGENTS.md automates iterations\n\n---\n\n## 6. IMPORTANT FILES REFERENCE\n\n### For Bug Fixes:\n- Read bug from: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md`\n- Create analysis in: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugs/<BugName>.md`\n- Update plan in: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md`\n- Follow directives in: `/repo/strategies/tasks/maintain/fixBugReport.md`\n\n### For Code Quality:\n- App directives: `/repo/strategies/tasks/build/writeApp.md`\n- Test directives: `/repo/strategies/tasks/build/writeTests.md`\n- Spec directives: `/repo/strategies/tasks/build/testSpec.md`\n- Violations checked by: `/repo/strategies/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md`\n\n### For Deployments:\n- Deploy script: Requires `npm run deploy` with env vars\n- Strategy: `/repo/strategies/tasks/deployment.md`\n- Current deployment: https://sales-crm-1771041441.netlify.app\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### 1. SSO popup opens in same window\nIn `src/pages/Login.tsx` line 33, the Google OAuth handler uses `window.location.href = ...` which navigates the current window to the OAuth provider URL. This replaces the app entirely. The fix is to open the OAuth flow in a new popup window using `window.open()`.\n\n### 2. Authentication is required (should be optional)\nThree components enforce mandatory authentication:\n\n- **Frontend route guard** (`src/components/auth/RequireAuth.tsx`): The `RequireAuth` component wraps all app routes in `App.tsx`. If not logged in, it redirects to `/login`.\n- **Backend middleware** (`netlify/utils/auth.ts`): All 11 Netlify Functions are wrapped with `requiresAuth()` which returns 401 if no Authorization header is present.\n- **Fetch interceptor** (`src/lib/auth.ts`): Automatically injects auth tokens — this is fine as-is since it only adds tokens when available.\n\n### 3.

Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n- Before: 0cd095c\n- After: 78daa0a\n- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior. Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n\n2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n- Before: 0301f38\n- After: 0cd095c\n- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":3,"oldLines":6,"newStart":3,"newLines":7,"lines":[" ## Open"," "," 2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow.

Update AuthProvider to not require login\n\nLet me update the files."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":284,"cache_read_input_tokens":115129,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":284,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ea780c21-dd76-4158-a0db-c55297864d38","uuid":"9a4e6865-533d-48ce-9f9b-3a445009286f"}

The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. Consider adding database re-seeding in `globalSetup` or `beforeAll`, or make tests that\n  create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated records.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

The unauthenticated tests fail because `sidebar-sign-in` isn't found. The sidebar IS loading (since `sidebar-user-area` IS visible in the 3rd test — the `sidebar` testid was found), but the sign-in button isn't showing. \n\nThe issue is likely that `loading` is still `true` when the page renders, and the `isLoggedIn` hasn't resolved yet. The condition in the sidebar is `isLoggedIn && user` — but during the loading phase, `isLoggedIn` is `false` (since session is null and hasStoredToken is false), so the sign-in button should show. Let me check more carefully...\n\nWait, actually in test 2, it fails at line 36 trying to find `sidebar-user-area` (the output from the first run). But in the second run, test 3 finds `sidebar` fine but not `sidebar-sign-in`. Let me look at the condition again in the sidebar:\n\n```tsx\n{isLoggedIn && user ? (\n  // user info\n) : (\n  // sign-in button\n)}\n```\n\nThe sign-in button should show when `!isLoggedIn || !user`. When loading, `isLoggedIn` is `false`, so the sign-in button should show immediately. But wait — the AuthProvider has `loading: true` initially. Let me check if the sidebar needs a longer timeout, or if perhaps the issue is that `auth.getSession()` is doing something with the fresh context that causes a delayed result.\n\nActually, the problem might be that the unauthenticated page navigates to a 404. Wait, `/clients` is a valid route now without RequireAuth.

When the AuthProvider's `loading` is `true` and the user is not authenticated, the condition `isLoggedIn && user` is `false`, so the sign-in button should appear. Unless there's a race condition where `getSession()` returns something for the `auth.nut.new` Supabase client even without a token.\n\nLet me take a closer look at the Sidebar again. The condition is `{isLoggedIn && user ? (userinfo) : (signin)}`. So when `isLoggedIn` is false and `user` is null, the sign-in button should show. The `sidebar-user-area` div is always rendered.

The page snapshot shows that even in the \"unauthenticated\" context, the sidebar is showing \"T\", \"Test User\", and \"Sign out\" — the user IS showing as authenticated! This is because the test created a fresh context without `storageState`, but there was a previous test run that authenticated and the auth may have persisted.\n\nWait, more likely: the fresh context has no `localStorage`, but the `auth.getSession()` call in the AuthProvider is returning a session from somewhere else. But that's not possible with a fresh browser context...\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the snapshot: lines 8-12 show \"T\", \"Test User\", and \"Sign out\". This means that even without the storageState, the Supabase client is finding a session somehow. \n\nBut wait — this is a *fresh* browser context with `browser.newContext()` (no storageState). How can it find a session? The issue might be that the Supabase auth client on the server side is caching something, or more likely, the fresh context is somehow inheriting state.\n\nActually, I think I see the issue: the tests run sequentially with 1 worker. The first test (AUTH-USR-01) runs authenticated. It might be setting cookies at the origin `localhost:8888` that persist in the browser instance. Even though we create a `newContext()`, the browser-level state might persist.\n\nWait, `browser.newContext()` should create a fully isolated context. Let me check if there's some other mechanism. \n\nActually, let me re-read the error context more carefully. I see `generic [ref=e9]: T` and `generic [ref=e10]: Test User`. This means the sidebar IS showing the authenticated user. In the fresh context with no storageState, the auth state is somehow available.\n\nThe issue is that in test mode, `getStoredSession()` is checking `localStorage`, and even though the fresh context has no localStorage, the `auth.getSession()` from the Supabase client might still be finding something. Or maybe the fetch interceptor in `auth.ts` is somehow getting tokens from elsewhere.\n\nWait — I bet the issue is that the test server's Supabase client might be setting a cookie via the Netlify proxy. Let me look at this from a different angle. The `AuthProvider` has `auth.getSession()` which is the Supabase auth client. In a fresh context, there should be nothing. But then `auth.onAuthStateChange` fires and might get something.\n\nThe most likely explanation is that the Supabase client is using cookies or some shared storage mechanism.

In the first test (authenticated, with storageState), the `localStorage` has the session data. The Supabase client's `onAuthStateChange` sees this and sets up its internal state.\n\nBut in the fresh `browser.newContext()`, there's no `localStorage` — so Supabase should have no session. The page snapshot clearly shows \"Test User\" though. Let me investigate more...\n\nActually wait — I re-read the error context. The test navigated to `/clients` and found the page fully rendered with data, showing \"Test User\" in the sidebar. This should NOT happen with a fresh context. Unless... the `getUserInfo` API is returning data even without auth. But `getUserInfo` uses `requiresAuth` which should return 401.\n\nWait, I think I found it. Let me look at the `useGetUserInfoQuery` call. It only runs when `isLoggedIn` is true (`skip: !isLoggedIn`). So in the fresh context, `isLoggedIn` should be `false`, meaning getUserInfo never runs, meaning `user` is `null`, meaning the sign-in button should show.\n\nBut the snapshot shows \"Test User\". So somehow `isLoggedIn` is `true` in the fresh context. How?\n\nOh! I think I see it — in the `getStoredSession()` function, we check `localStorage` for `SUPABASE_STORAGE_KEY`. In a completely fresh context, `localStorage` is empty, so `getStoredSession()` returns `false`. But then `auth.getSession()` is called, which might return a session because Supabase is somehow sharing state across contexts.\n\nActually, Supabase uses `localStorage` — and in a fresh context there IS no localStorage data. So `auth.getSession()` should return null. Unless the Supabase client is using cookies too.\n\nLet me try a simpler approach — let me verify by adding a `page.evaluate` check. Actually, I think the simplest explanation is: the `IS_TEST=true` flag in the web server setup means the server is re-using the same session. But no — the server uses `optionalAuth` now, and it will just set `user = null` if no token is provided. The issue is on the **client side**.\n\nActually wait — I bet the Supabase client on `auth.nut.new` has cookies set from the first test, and the second test's browser context might share those cookies. No, `browser.newContext()` gives a completely isolated cookie jar.\n\nLet me just check what happened with the real recording by taking a screenshot in the test:"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1363,"cache_read_input_tokens":125281,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1363,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ea780c21-dd76-4158-a0db-c55297864d38","uuid":"2f311bee-eb0b-40ce-9571-54733f907bc3"}

The fresh context DOES have `sb-auth-auth-token` in localStorage. But how? The `browser.newContext()` should give an empty localStorage...\n\nThe issue is that the Playwright config uses `storageState: './tests/test-storage-state.json'` at the `use` level. Even though the test creates `browser.newContext()` without explicitly passing `storageState`, the browser itself was launched with the config that includes storageState as default. Let me verify — `browser.newContext()` without arguments should give a truly empty context.\n\nWait, actually looking at the Playwright docs: `browser.newContext()` should NOT inherit the default `storageState` from the config. The config's `storageState` is only used when Playwright creates contexts for tests using `{ page }`. When you create a context manually via `browser.newContext()`, it starts clean.\n\nBut the test output shows `localStorage` has the key! This means something is setting it even in the fresh context. Let me think...\n\nOh! I bet the issue is that the test server starts with `IS_TEST=true`, and the Supabase client in the browser might be auto-detecting a session from somewhere else. Or maybe the `global-setup.ts` is writing data to the server-side storage that persists.\n\nActually the simpler explanation: the `globalSetup` seeds the database, which creates a test user in the `users` table. The getUserInfo endpoint returns user info for whoever's JWT is valid. But in a fresh context, there IS no JWT...\n\nWait — let me look at the Replay browser. The `storageState` is set as a project-level default. The Replay browser context might be pre-loaded with it. Let me check if `browser.newContext()` is actually clean by looking at the Playwright docs for this behavior more carefully.\n\nActually, the answer is in the Playwright config:\n\n```ts\nuse: {\n  storageState: './tests/test-storage-state.json',\n}\n```\n\nThis sets storageState as the **default** for all contexts created by Playwright. `browser.newContext()` without explicit options may pick up this default.

The test spec (AUTH-LGN-01, AUTH-LGN-02) specified the Login page UI but didn't test the SSO popup behavior (that it should open in a new window). The spec just said \"Google OAuth button\" — it didn't specify the behavior of clicking it.\n3.

The test spec was underspecified for the OAuth flow behavior. Problem stage: `testSpec.md`.\n\nFor auth being optional: this is a change in requirements.

Add testids during initial component development,\n    32→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    33→\n    34→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    35→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    36→  not the git repository root.\n    37→\n    38→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    39→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    40→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    41→\n    42→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    43→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    44→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    45→\n    46→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    47→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    48→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    49→\n    50→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    51→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    52→\n    53→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    54→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    55→  to the same destination.\n    56→\n    57→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    58→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    59→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    60→\n    61→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    62→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    63→  icon for all attachment types.\n    64→\n    65→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    66→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    67→\n    68→## Tips\n    69→\n    70→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n    71→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n    72→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n    73→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n    74→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n    75→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n    76→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n    77→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n    78→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n    79→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n    80→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n    81→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n    82→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n    83→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n    84→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n    85→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n    86→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n    87→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n    88→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n    89→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n    90→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n    91→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n    92→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_0124zDNe7otxBhqQ1hi4thwM","session_id":"ea780c21-dd76-4158-a0db-c55297864d38","uuid":"27a67100-6186-4d91-ab7e-81b86d03edf3"}

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    28→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    29→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    30→\n    31→## Directives\n    32→\n    33→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other.

Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    36→\n    37→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.

If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    38→\n    39→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    40→\n    41→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    42→\n    43→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    44→\n    45→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    46→\n    47→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    48→\n    49→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    50→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    51→\n    52→## Tips\n    53→\n    54→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch.

Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    24→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n    25→\n    26→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work.

[2026-02-17T16:36:20.852Z] {"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. User requested \"do a round of maintenance, focusing on bug reports\"\n2. I read AGENTS.md and bugReports.md to understand the maintenance process\n3. I explored the repo structure thoroughly using Task agents\n4. I read the maintenance strategy files: maintainApp.md, fixBugReport.md, reviewBugReport.md, checkDirectives.md, polishApp.md, deployment.md\n5. I read plan.md and found it needed Maintenance Round 5 added\n6. I set up Maintenance Round 5 in plan.md with all stage tasks\n7. I found 1 open bug: \"2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\"\n8. I analyzed the bug thoroughly by reading all auth-related files\n9. Created bug analysis document at docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n10. Implemented the fix across backend and frontend:\n    - Backend: Created `optionalAuth` middleware alongside existing `requiresAuth`, changed all 10 data functions to use `optionalAuth`, kept `getUserInfo` with `requiresAuth`\n    - Changed `AuthenticatedRequest` to `OptionalAuthRequest` with `user: UserRecord | null`\n    - Changed all `req.user.name` to `req.user?.name ?? 'System'`\n    - Frontend: Removed RequireAuth guard from App.tsx, removed Login/Register page routes\n    - Updated AuthCallback to post message to opener window instead of navigating\n    - Updated AuthProvider to add `signIn` function that opens OAuth in popup window, added message listener for auth-callback\n    - Updated Sidebar to show user info at top (below app title) with sign-in/sign-out\n11. Updated test spec in tests.md - removed Login/Register test entries, updated SidebarUserInfo entries\n12. Rewrote auth.spec.ts with 3 new tests\n13. Fixed test failures where `browser.newContext()` was inheriting storageState from playwright config - needed to pass `{ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } }` explicitly\n14. All 188 tests passed\n15. Updated AppRevisions.md with the changes\n16. Resolved the bug in bugReports.md\n17. Classified the bug (problem stage: testSpec.md - OAuth button click behavior was underspecified)\n18. Updated testSpec.md directive about external flow buttons\n19. Moved bug to Finished section in bugReports.md\n20. Checked directives across the app - no violations found\n21. Verified TypeScript and ESLint pass\n22. Staged all files for commit\n\nKey errors encountered:\n- File not read errors when trying to write/edit files that hadn't been read yet in the current context\n- Sibling tool call errors when one edit in a batch failed\n- Tests failed because `browser.newContext()` was inheriting the default `storageState` from playwright.config.ts - fixed by passing explicit empty storageState\n- Background test run got stuck due to zombie processes - had to kill and restart\n- Test run timed out initially - had to force kill processes and restart\n\nThe work was at the point of committing all changes. The git add was completed but the commit itself hadn't been made yet.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user requested \"do a round of maintenance, focusing on bug reports\" for the SalesCRM application. This triggered Maintenance Round 5 following the structured maintenance workflow defined in `strategies/messages/maintainApp.md`, which includes: fixBugReport → reviewBugReport → checkDirectives → polishApp → deployment.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Maintenance Round workflow**: fixBugReport.md → reviewBugReport.md → checkDirectives.md → polishApp.md → deployment.md\n   - **Optional vs Required Auth middleware**: Created `optionalAuth` (allows unauthenticated requests) alongside `requiresAuth` (returns 401 for unauthenticated)\n   - **OptionalAuthRequest type**: `user: UserRecord | null` instead of `user: UserRecord`\n   - **OAuth popup window flow**: SSO opens in popup via `window.open()`, callback page posts message to opener via `postMessage`, AuthProvider listens for messages\n   - **Playwright storageState inheritance**: `browser.newContext()` inherits default storageState from config; must pass `{ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } }` for truly empty context\n   - **Tech stack**: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Redux/RTK Query, Supabase Auth, Neon Postgres, Netlify Functions, Playwright, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS\n   - **Bug classification process**: Identify problem stage (testSpec.md, writeApp.md, writeTests.md, or none) and update directives\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/auth.ts`** — Core auth middleware, completely rewritten\n     - Added `optionalAuth` function that extracts user from JWT if present but allows unauthenticated requests\n     - `requiresAuth` now wraps `optionalAuth` and adds 401 check\n     - Changed `AuthenticatedRequest` to `OptionalAuthRequest` with `user: UserRecord | null`\n     ```typescript\n     export interface OptionalAuthRequest extends Request {\n       user: UserRecord | null\n     }\n     \n     export function optionalAuth(\n       handler: (req: OptionalAuthRequest) => Promise<Response>\n     ) {\n       return async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {\n         const authReq = req as OptionalAuthRequest\n         authReq.user = null\n         // ... JWT verification, user provisioning if token present\n         // Invalid token or no token → proceed with user = null\n         return handler(authReq)\n       }\n     }\n     \n     export function requiresAuth(\n       handler: (req: OptionalAuthRequest) => Promise<Response>\n     ) {\n       return optionalAuth(async (req: OptionalAuthRequest) => {\n         if (!req.user) {\n           return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Missing authorization token' }), {\n             status: 401, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n           })\n         }\n         return handler(req)\n       })\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **All 10 Netlify Functions** (clients.ts, deals.ts, tasks.ts, deal-detail.ts, client-attachments.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-timeline.ts, individuals.ts)\n     - Changed import from `requiresAuth, type AuthenticatedRequest` to `optionalAuth, type OptionalAuthRequest`\n     - Changed handler signature from `AuthenticatedRequest` to `OptionalAuthRequest`\n     - Changed all `${req.user.name}` to `${req.user?.name ?? 'System'}`\n     - Changed export from `requiresAuth(handler)` to `optionalAuth(handler)`\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/getUserInfo.ts`** — Kept with `requiresAuth` (still requires auth)\n     - Changed type to `OptionalAuthRequest` but kept `requiresAuth` wrapper\n     - Changed `req.user.id` etc. to `req.user!.id` (non-null assertion since requiresAuth guarantees user exists)\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`** — Removed RequireAuth guard and Login/Register routes\n     ```typescript\n     export default function App() {\n       return (\n         <Routes>\n           <Route path=\"/auth/callback\" element={<AuthCallbackPage />} />\n           <Route element={<AppLayout />}>\n             <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navigate to=\"/clients\" replace />} />\n             <Route path=\"/clients\" element={<ClientsListPage />} />\n             {/* ... other routes ... */}\n             <Route path=\"*\" element={<NotFoundPage />} />\n           </Route>\n         </Routes>\n       )\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`** — Added signIn function and popup message listener\n     - Added `signIn` to context interface and default value\n     - Added `useCallback` signIn function that opens OAuth in popup window\n     - Added `useEffect` that listens for `auth-callback` postMessage events from popup\n     ```typescript\n     const signIn = useCallback(() => {\n       const callbackUrl = `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`\n       const authUrl = `https://auth.nut.new/functions/v1/oauth/start?provider=google&redirect_to=${encodeURIComponent(callbackUrl)}`\n       const width = 500; const height = 600\n       const left = window.screenX + (window.innerWidth - width) / 2\n       const top = window.screenY + (window.innerHeight - height) / 2\n       window.open(authUrl, 'auth-popup', `width=${width},height=${height},left=${left},top=${top}`)\n     }, [])\n     ```\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx`** — Changed from navigate to postMessage+close\n     ```typescript\n     useEffect(() => {\n       const timer = setTimeout(() => {\n         if (window.opener) {\n           window.opener.postMessage({ type: 'auth-callback' }, window.location.origin)\n           window.close()\n         } else {\n           window.location.href = '/'\n         }\n       }, 1000)\n       return () => clearTimeout(timer)\n     }, [])\n     ```\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`** — User info moved to upper left with sign-in/sign-out\n     - Shows avatar/name/sign-out when logged in\n     - Shows \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in\n     - User area has `data-testid=\"sidebar-user-area\"`, sign-in button has `data-testid=\"sidebar-sign-in\"`\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/auth.spec.ts`** — Rewritten with 3 new tests\n     - AUTH-USR-01: Authenticated user sees avatar, name, sign-out in sidebar\n     - AUTH-USR-02: Unauthenticated user sees sign-in button (uses empty storageState)\n     - AUTH-USR-03: App loads without authentication (sidebar visible with nav links)\n     - Key fix: `browser.newContext({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } })` for truly empty context\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`** — Updated auth test spec section\n     - Removed LoginPage and RegisterPage test entries (AUTH-LGN-01, AUTH-LGN-02, AUTH-REG-01, AUTH-REG-02)\n     - Updated SidebarUserInfo → SidebarUserArea with 3 new test entries (AUTH-USR-01, AUTH-USR-02, AUTH-USR-03)\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md`** — Bug moved from Open → Finished\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/AppRevisions.md`** — Added 2/17/2026 entry about auth changes\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md`** — Added Maintenance Round 5 with all tasks marked complete\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md`** — New bug analysis document\n   - **`/repo/strategies/tasks/build/testSpec.md`** — Updated directive about external flow buttons\n\n4. Errors and Fixes:\n   - **\"File has not been read yet\" errors**: When trying to Edit/Write files that weren't in the current read cache. Fixed by re-reading files before editing.\n   - **\"Sibling tool call errored\" errors**: When one Edit in a batch failed, all parallel siblings also failed. Fixed by reading all files first, then editing.\n   - **Playwright tests AUTH-USR-02 and AUTH-USR-03 failed**: `browser.newContext()` was inheriting the default `storageState` from `playwright.config.ts`. Debug log showed `localStorage keys in fresh context: ['sb-auth-auth-token']` — the test JWT was present even in the \"fresh\" context. Fixed by passing explicit empty storageState: `browser.newContext({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } })`.\n   - **Background test run stuck**: Zombie vite processes accumulated from multiple test runs. Fixed by `pkill -9 -f \"netlify\"`, `pkill -9 -f \"vite\"`, etc. before restarting.\n   - **AUTH-USR-01 initially failed in first full run**: Due to stale server state from previous test runs. Resolved after killing all processes and running fresh.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Making auth optional end-to-end**: Required coordinated changes across backend middleware (optionalAuth), all 11 Netlify functions, frontend routing (remove RequireAuth), AuthProvider (add signIn/popup), AuthCallback (postMessage), and Sidebar (user area at top).\n   - **SSO popup flow**: Replaced `window.location.href` redirect with `window.open()` popup, AuthCallback posts message back to opener and closes, AuthProvider listens for the message and refreshes session.\n   - **User fallback for timeline events**: All `req.user.name` references changed to `req.user?.name ?? 'System'` so unauthenticated actions use \"System\" as the actor name.\n   - **Bug classification**: Determined problem stage was `testSpec.md` because the OAuth button's click behavior (popup vs redirect) was not specified in the original test entries.\n   - All 188 Playwright tests pass after changes.\n\n6. All User Messages:\n   - \"do a round of maintenance, focusing on bug reports\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - **Commit the staged changes** — `git add` was completed but `git commit` has not been executed yet\n   - **Deployment** — The `deployment.md: UnpackDeployment` task in plan.md is still marked `[ ]` (not complete). Per the maintenance workflow, after committing, the app should be deployed to production.\n\n8. Current Work:\n   All files have been staged with `git add` for commit. The 23 modified/new files are staged. The commit message has not been written yet. The last command executed was:\n   ```\n   git add apps/SalesCRM/docs/AppRevisions.md apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md [... all 23 files ...]\n   ```\n   TypeScript compilation passes, ESLint passes (1 pre-existing warning only), and all 188 Playwright tests pass.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   The immediate next step is to execute `git commit` with a descriptive message for the Maintenance Round 5 changes, then proceed with the deployment stage (`deployment.md`). The staged files are ready. The commit message should follow the pattern of previous commits (e.g., \"Complete Maintenance Round 5: fix SSO auth bug, make auth optional\").\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /repo/.agent-home/.claude/projects/-repo/ea780c21-dd76-4158-a0db-c55297864d38.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions.
