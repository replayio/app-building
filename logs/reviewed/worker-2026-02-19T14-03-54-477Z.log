This is the single entry point for running tests.\n    33→\n    34→### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n    35→\n    36→1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n    37→   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n    38→   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n    39→\n    40→2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n    41→   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n    42→   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n    43→   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n    44→\n    45→3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n    46→   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n    47→   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n    48→   independent of all previous runs.\n    49→\n    50→4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n    51→   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n    52→   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n    53→   of tests.\n    54→\n    55→5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n    56→   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n    57→   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n    58→   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n    59→\n    60→6. **Uploads a recording on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test` must automatically\n    61→   upload ONE Replay recording using `npx [REDACTED]io upload` and log the uploaded recording ID\n    62→   to stdout. This makes the recording immediately available for Replay MCP analysis without\n    63→   any manual step. The post-test script uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n    64→   recording with a non-trivial duration and uploads it.\n    65→\n    66→### Implementation pattern:\n    67→\n    68→The `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\n    69→Use a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\n    70→the post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n    71→\n    72→```json\n    73→{\n    74→  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n    75→}\n    76→```\n    77→\n    78→Where `run-tests.sh`:\n    79→- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code\n    80→- If the exit code is non-zero, uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent recording\n    81→  with a non-trivial duration (filtering out 1.0ms stub recordings)\n    82→- Uploads that single recording via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <recording-id>`\n    83→- Logs the uploaded recording ID clearly (e.g., `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`)\n    84→- Exits with the original Playwright exit code\n    85→\n    86→Where `setup-test-branch`:\n    87→- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n    88→- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n    89→- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n    90→- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n    91→- Seeds the branch with test data\n    92→- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n    93→\n    94→The Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\n    95→deletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n    96→`DATABASE_URL`.\n    97→\n    98→Extra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n    99→`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n   100→\n   101→## Running Tests\n   102→\n   103→Every time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n   104→- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   105→- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n   106→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   107→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   108→\n   109→### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n   110→\n   111→Tests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\n   112→or with the production database.\n   113→\n   114→**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\n   115→branch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\n   116→worker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\n   117→isolated branch.\n   118→\n   119→**How it works**:\n   120→\n   121→1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   122→   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n   123→     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   124→   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n   125→     schema is current.\n   126→   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   127→   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n   128→     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   129→   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n   130→\n   131→2. **Worker execution**:\n   132→   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n   133→     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n   134→     to pass the correct URL.\n   135→   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n   136→     data contamination is possible.\n   137→\n   138→3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   139→   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   140→   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n   141→\n   142→**Key requirements**:\n   143→- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n   144→- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n   145→  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n   146→- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n   147→  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n   148→- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n   149→  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n   150→\n   151→## Debugging\n   152→\n   153→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   154→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   155→\n   156→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   157→2. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   158→   uploads a recording on failure and logs the recording ID (look for\n   159→   `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` in the output). If the upload did not happen (e.g., the\n   160→   post-test script was misconfigured), use `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   161→   recording with a non-trivial duration and upload it manually: `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   162→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   163→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   164→   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   165→   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   166→   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n   167→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   170→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   171→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   172→\n   173→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   174→\n   175→## Directives\n   176→\n   177→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   178→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   179→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   180→\n   181→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   183→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   184→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   185→\n   186→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   187→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   188→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   189→\n   190→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   191→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   192→\n   193→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   194→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   195→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   196→\n   197→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n   198→  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n   199→  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n   200→\n   201→- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n   202→  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n   203→  `DATABASE_URL`.\n   204→\n   205→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   206→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   207→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   208→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   209→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   210→\n   211→- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n   212→  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n   213→  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.

The subtask must require committing and exiting afterwards. Focus on that subtask until finished.\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## The `npm run test` Command\n\nEvery app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n\n### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n\n1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n\n2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n\n3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   independent of all previous runs.\n\n4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   of tests.\n\n5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n\n6. **Uploads a recording on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test` must automatically\n   upload ONE Replay recording using `npx [REDACTED]io upload` and log the uploaded recording ID\n   to stdout. This makes the recording immediately available for Replay MCP analysis without\n   any manual step. The post-test script uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and uploads it.\n\n### Implementation pattern:\n\nThe `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\nUse a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\nthe post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `run-tests.sh`:\n- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code\n- If the exit code is non-zero, uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent recording\n  with a non-trivial duration (filtering out 1.0ms stub recordings)\n- Uploads that single recording via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <recording-id>`\n- Logs the uploaded recording ID clearly (e.g., `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`)\n- Exits with the original Playwright exit code\n\nWhere `setup-test-branch`:\n- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n- Seeds the branch with test data\n- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n\nThe Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\ndeletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n`DATABASE_URL`.\n\nExtra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nEvery time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n\nTests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\nor with the production database.\n\n**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\nbranch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\nworker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\nisolated branch.\n\n**How it works**:\n\n1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n     schema is current.\n   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n\n2. **Worker execution**:\n   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n     to pass the correct URL.\n   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n     data contamination is possible.\n\n3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n\n**Key requirements**:\n- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads a recording on failure and logs the recording ID (look for\n   `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` in the output). If the upload did not happen (e.g., the\n   post-test script was misconfigured), use `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and upload it manually: `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n\n- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n  `DATABASE_URL`.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly. Running\n  `npx playwright test` alone will cause tests to use stale or missing database branches.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use the Replay browser and the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package.\n  Specifically:\n  1. Use the Replay browser via `launchOptions.executablePath` pointing at\n     `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`. Do NOT use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`'s `devices`\n     export — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported platforms.\n  2. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n     with `upload: false`. Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n\n  Example config:\n  ```ts\n  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n  import { homedir } from 'os';\n  import { join } from 'path';\n\n  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    reporter: [\n      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n        upload: false,\n      }),\n      ['html'],\n      ['list'],\n    ],\n    use: {\n      launchOptions: {\n        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working.

Once a bug or flaky test is captured, anyone can inspect it with Browser DevTools without having to replicate it locally.\n\nReplay records automated browser tests by replacing the browser normally used to run your tests. Playwright must be configured to launch the Replay Browser to generate recordings.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Installation\n\nThe latest version of `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` is 5.0.1. You can start using it in your project by running `npm i @[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n\nThis installs the Replay Browsers on your machine and provides functionality for recording tests with Replay.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Configuration\n\nIn your `playwright.config.ts` file, import `devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`. This gives you access to \"Replay Firefox\" and \"Replay Chromium\" devices to set the browser in your config using Playwright projects.\n\nEnsure your project is configured with `[REDACTED]io/playwright`. Configure Playwright to only use a single worker and increase the timeout if needed to allow for increased run time.\n\nOnly the `[REDACTED]-firefox` and `[REDACTED]-chromium` projects will generate [REDACTED]s.\n\nSet `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` as an environment variable locally. Pass the `--project` flag with your selected browser option: `--project project-name` (`[REDACTED]-chromium` or `[REDACTED]-firefox`). Currently supported browser options are `[REDACTED]-chromium` (Linux) or `[REDACTED]-firefox` (macOS, Linux).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Recording and Uploading Tests\n\nWith everything set up, you can now run `playwright test` to record and upload your first Playwright [REDACTED]s.\n\nReplays are uploaded locally using the `@[REDACTED]io/[REDACTED]` CLI. Your API key must be set as the `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` environment variable to upload. To see available [REDACTED]s for upload, use `npx @[REDACTED]io/[REDACTED] ls`; to upload a single [REDACTED], use `npx @[REDACTED]io/[REDACTED] upload <id>`; to upload all available [REDACTED]s, use `npx @[REDACTED]io/[REDACTED] upload-all`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. CI Integration (GitHub Actions)\n\nUsing `action-playwright` in your GitHub Actions workflow is the easiest way to get started recording your Playwright tests in CI. The action ensures Replay Browsers are installed on the CI machine, runs your tests with the browser set for a given project, uploads [REDACTED]s from the test run to the team associated with the given API key, and comments on the initiating pull request with links to the test run and [REDACTED]s.\n\nThe GitHub Action can be used as follows:\n\nAdd the configuration to your existing workflow. Install the Replay GitHub App to add comments to your Pull Requests with links to [REDACTED]s of your tests, using `[REDACTED]io/action-playwright@v0.7.0` with your `api-key` and `project: [REDACTED]-firefox`.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Debugging\n\nYou can learn how to use Replay DevTools to debug your tests. The Test Suite Dashboard helps you stay on top of your test suite health.\n\nReplay is designed to record tests in CI so you can debug when tests fail. Without Replay, test failures in CI are like a black box, with little insights into what went wrong.\n\n---\n\n### Key Resources\n- **Official Docs**: [docs.[REDACTED].io](https://docs.[REDACTED].io/test-suites/playwright/installation)\n- **GitHub Action**: [[REDACTED]io/action-playwright](https://github.com/[REDACTED]io/action-playwright)\n- **NPM Package**: [@[REDACTED]io/playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@[REDACTED]io/playwright)\n- **Replay-enabled Playwright Fork**: [[REDACTED]io/playwright](https://github.com/[REDACTED]io/playwright)\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2e3a0adf-1292-47b9-8c8a-7bc3e16a1d6f","uuid":"91487cf1-ace3-4ea2-840e-dbf4531da44f","tool_use_result":{"query":"[REDACTED].io playwright integration install configure record tests 2025 2026","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01N3ph69VZ8aNueRqjKisdVD","content":[{"title":"Getting Started: Record your Playwright test - Replay.io","url":"https://docs.[REDACTED].io/basics/getting-started/record-your-playwright-tests"},{"title":"GitHub - [REDACTED]io/action-playwright: Run and record Playwright tests with Replay","url":"https://github.com/[REDACTED]io/action-playwright"},{"title":"Replay docs","url":"https://docs.[REDACTED].io/test-suites/playwright/installation"},{"title":"Playwright Instructions","url":"https://docs.[REDACTED].io/recording-browser-tests-(beta)/playwright-instructions"},{"title":"Playwright - Replay docs","url":"https://docs.[REDACTED].io/test-runners/playwright/record-your-first-[REDACTED]"},{"title":"playwright-tests/README.md at main · [REDACTED]io/playwright-tests","url":"https://github.com/[REDACTED]io/playwright-tests/blob/main/README.md"},{"title":"GitHub - [REDACTED]io/playwright-tests: Playwright harness and tests used by [REDACTED] CI","url":"https://github.com/[REDACTED]io/playwright-tests"},{"title":"@[REDACTED]io/playwright - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@[REDACTED]io/playwright"},{"title":"GitHub - [REDACTED]io/playwright: Replay enabled fork of the Playwright library","url":"https://github.com/[REDACTED]io/playwright"},{"title":"[Question] Is it possible to enable the 'Record and Replay' feature as a global setting? · Issue #17899 · microsoft/playwright","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/17899"}]},"Here's a comprehensive overview of how to integrate **Replay.io with Playwright** for recording and debugging tests:\n\n---\n\n## Replay.io + Playwright Integration\n\n### What is Replay.io?\n\nReplay is the first deterministic browser.

This is the single entry point for running tests.\n    33→\n    34→### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n    35→\n    36→1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n    37→   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n    38→   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n    39→\n    40→2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n    41→   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n    42→   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n    43→   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n    44→\n    45→3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n    46→   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n    47→   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n    48→   independent of all previous runs.\n    49→\n    50→4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n    51→   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n    52→   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n    53→   of tests.\n    54→\n    55→5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n    56→   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n    57→   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n    58→   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n    59→\n    60→6. **Uploads a recording on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test` must automatically\n    61→   upload ONE Replay recording using `npx [REDACTED]io upload` and log the uploaded recording ID\n    62→   to stdout. This makes the recording immediately available for Replay MCP analysis without\n    63→   any manual step. The post-test script uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n    64→   recording with a non-trivial duration and uploads it.\n    65→\n    66→### Implementation pattern:\n    67→\n    68→The `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\n    69→Use a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\n    70→the post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n    71→\n    72→```json\n    73→{\n    74→  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n    75→}\n    76→```\n    77→\n    78→Where `run-tests.sh`:\n    79→- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code\n    80→- If the exit code is non-zero, uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent recording\n    81→  with a non-trivial duration (filtering out 1.0ms stub recordings)\n    82→- Uploads that single recording via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <recording-id>`\n    83→- Logs the uploaded recording ID clearly (e.g., `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`)\n    84→- Exits with the original Playwright exit code\n    85→\n    86→Where `setup-test-branch`:\n    87→- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n    88→- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n    89→- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n    90→- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n    91→- Seeds the branch with test data\n    92→- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n    93→\n    94→The Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\n    95→deletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n    96→`DATABASE_URL`.\n    97→\n    98→Extra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n    99→`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n   100→\n   101→## Running Tests\n   102→\n   103→Every time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n   104→- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   105→- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n   106→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   107→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   108→\n   109→### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n   110→\n   111→Tests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\n   112→or with the production database.\n   113→\n   114→**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\n   115→branch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown.

The subtask must require committing and exiting afterwards. Focus on that subtask until finished.\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## The `npm run test` Command\n\nEvery app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n\n### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n\n1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n\n2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n\n3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   independent of all previous runs.\n\n4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   of tests.\n\n5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n\n6. **Uploads a recording on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test` must automatically\n   upload ONE Replay recording using `npx [REDACTED]io upload` and log the uploaded recording ID\n   to stdout. This makes the recording immediately available for Replay MCP analysis without\n   any manual step. The post-test script uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and uploads it.\n\n### Implementation pattern:\n\nThe `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\nUse a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\nthe post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `run-tests.sh`:\n- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code\n- If the exit code is non-zero, uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent recording\n  with a non-trivial duration (filtering out 1.0ms stub recordings)\n- Uploads that single recording via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <recording-id>`\n- Logs the uploaded recording ID clearly (e.g., `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`)\n- Exits with the original Playwright exit code\n\nWhere `setup-test-branch`:\n- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n- Seeds the branch with test data\n- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n\nThe Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\ndeletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n`DATABASE_URL`.\n\nExtra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nEvery time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n\nTests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\nor with the production database.\n\n**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\nbranch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\nworker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\nisolated branch.\n\n**How it works**:\n\n1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n     schema is current.\n   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n\n2. **Worker execution**:\n   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n     to pass the correct URL.\n   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n     data contamination is possible.\n\n3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n\n**Key requirements**:\n- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads a recording on failure and logs the recording ID (look for\n   `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` in the output). If the upload did not happen (e.g., the\n   post-test script was misconfigured), use `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and upload it manually: `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n\n- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n  `DATABASE_URL`.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle.

Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n\n  Example config:\n  ```ts\n  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n  import { homedir } from 'os';\n  import { join } from 'path';\n\n  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    reporter: [\n      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n        upload: false,\n      }),\n      ['html'],\n      ['list'],\n    ],\n    use: {\n      launchOptions: {\n        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working.

Focus on that subtask until finished.\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## The `npm run test` Command\n\nEvery app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n\n### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n\n1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n\n2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n\n3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   independent of all previous runs.\n\n4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   of tests.\n\n5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n\n6. **Uploads a recording on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test` must automatically\n   upload ONE Replay recording using `npx [REDACTED]io upload` and log the uploaded recording ID\n   to stdout. This makes the recording immediately available for Replay MCP analysis without\n   any manual step. The post-test script uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and uploads it.\n\n### Implementation pattern:\n\nThe `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\nUse a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\nthe post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `run-tests.sh`:\n- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code\n- If the exit code is non-zero, uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent recording\n  with a non-trivial duration (filtering out 1.0ms stub recordings)\n- Uploads that single recording via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <recording-id>`\n- Logs the uploaded recording ID clearly (e.g., `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`)\n- Exits with the original Playwright exit code\n\nWhere `setup-test-branch`:\n- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n- Seeds the branch with test data\n- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n\nThe Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\ndeletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n`DATABASE_URL`.\n\nExtra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nEvery time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n\nTests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\nor with the production database.\n\n**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\nbranch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\nworker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\nisolated branch.\n\n**How it works**:\n\n1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n     schema is current.\n   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n\n2. **Worker execution**:\n   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n     to pass the correct URL.\n   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n     data contamination is possible.\n\n3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n\n**Key requirements**:\n- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads a recording on failure and logs the recording ID (look for\n   `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` in the output). If the upload did not happen (e.g., the\n   post-test script was misconfigured), use `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and upload it manually: `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n\n- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n  `DATABASE_URL`.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly. Running\n  `npx playwright test` alone will cause tests to use stale or missing database branches.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use the Replay browser and the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package.\n  Specifically:\n  1. Use the Replay browser via `launchOptions.executablePath` pointing at\n     `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`. Do NOT use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`'s `devices`\n     export — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported platforms.\n  2. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n     with `upload: false`. Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n\n  Example config:\n  ```ts\n  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n  import { homedir } from 'os';\n  import { join } from 'path';\n\n  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    reporter: [\n      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n        upload: false,\n      }),\n      ['html'],\n      ['list'],\n    ],\n    use: {\n      launchOptions: {\n        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite.

Do NOT use the `devices` export from\n   `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported\n   platforms.\n3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so DOM snapshots are captured.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\nimport { homedir } from 'os';\nimport { join } from 'path';\n\nconst [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['html'],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    launchOptions: {\n      executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n      env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## The `npm run test` Command\n\nEvery app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n\n### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n\n1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n\n2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n\n3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   independent of all previous runs.\n\n4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   of tests.\n\n5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n\n6. **Uploads a recording on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test` must automatically\n   upload ONE Replay recording using `npx [REDACTED]io upload` and log the uploaded recording ID\n   to stdout. This makes the recording immediately available for Replay MCP analysis without\n   any manual step. The post-test script uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and uploads it.\n\n### Implementation pattern:\n\nThe `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\nUse a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\nthe post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `run-tests.sh`:\n- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code\n- If the exit code is non-zero, uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent recording\n  with a non-trivial duration (filtering out 1.0ms stub recordings)\n- Uploads that single recording via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <recording-id>`\n- Logs the uploaded recording ID clearly (e.g., `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`)\n- Exits with the original Playwright exit code\n\nWhere `setup-test-branch`:\n- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n- Seeds the branch with test data\n- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n\nThe Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\ndeletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n`DATABASE_URL`.\n\nExtra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nEvery time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n\nTests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\nor with the production database.\n\n**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\nbranch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\nworker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\nisolated branch.\n\n**How it works**:\n\n1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n     schema is current.\n   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n\n2. **Worker execution**:\n   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n     to pass the correct URL.\n   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n     data contamination is possible.\n\n3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n\n**Key requirements**:\n- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads a recording on failure and logs the recording ID (look for\n   `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` in the output). If the upload did not happen (e.g., the\n   post-test script was misconfigured), use `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and upload it manually: `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n\n- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n  `DATABASE_URL`.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly. Running\n  `npx playwright test` alone will cause tests to use stale or missing database branches.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use the Replay browser and the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package.\n  Specifically:\n  1. Use the Replay browser via `launchOptions.executablePath` pointing at\n     `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`. Do NOT use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`'s `devices`\n     export — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported platforms.\n  2. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n     with `upload: false`. Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n\n  Example config:\n  ```ts\n  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n  import { homedir } from 'os';\n  import { join } from 'path';\n\n  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    reporter: [\n      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n        upload: false,\n      }),\n      ['html'],\n      ['list'],\n    ],\n    use: {\n      launchOptions: {\n        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite.

The subtask must require committing and exiting afterwards. Focus on that subtask until finished.\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n   with `upload: false`. Uploads are handled by the post-test script, NOT by the reporter.\n2. Set `launchOptions.executablePath` to the Replay browser path\n   (`~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`). Do NOT use the `devices` export from\n   `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported\n   platforms.\n3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so DOM snapshots are captured.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\nimport { homedir } from 'os';\nimport { join } from 'path';\n\nconst [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['html'],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    launchOptions: {\n      executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n      env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## The `npm run test` Command\n\nEvery app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n\n### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n\n1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n\n2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n\n3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   independent of all previous runs.\n\n4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   of tests.\n\n5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n\n6. **Uploads recordings and logs full metadata on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test`\n   must automatically upload ALL Replay recordings from the run that have a non-trivial\n   duration (filtering out 1ms stubs and in-progress recordings). For each uploaded recording,\n   the script must log its full metadata (ID, date, duration, URI, status) so that any\n   recording — not just one — can be used for Replay MCP analysis. The script uses\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to get structured metadata, filters to finished recordings with\n   duration > 100ms, uploads each one, and prints the full metadata block for every recording.\n   After all uploads, it also cleans up local recordings with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n\n### Implementation pattern:\n\nThe `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\nUse a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\nthe post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `run-tests.sh`:\n- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code\n- If the exit code is non-zero, uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent recording\n  with a non-trivial duration (filtering out 1.0ms stub recordings)\n- Uploads that single recording via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <recording-id>`\n- Logs the uploaded recording ID clearly (e.g., `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`)\n- Exits with the original Playwright exit code\n\nWhere `setup-test-branch`:\n- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n- Seeds the branch with test data\n- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n\nThe Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\ndeletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n`DATABASE_URL`.\n\nExtra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nEvery time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n\nTests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\nor with the production database.\n\n**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\nbranch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\nworker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\nisolated branch.\n\n**How it works**:\n\n1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n     schema is current.\n   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n\n2. **Worker execution**:\n   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n     to pass the correct URL.\n   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n     data contamination is possible.\n\n3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n\n**Key requirements**:\n- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads a recording on failure and logs the recording ID (look for\n   `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` in the output). If the upload did not happen (e.g., the\n   post-test script was misconfigured), use `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and upload it manually: `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n\n- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n  `DATABASE_URL`.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly. Running\n  `npx playwright test` alone will cause tests to use stale or missing database branches.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use the Replay browser and the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package.\n  Specifically:\n  1. Use the Replay browser via `launchOptions.executablePath` pointing at\n     `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`. Do NOT use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`'s `devices`\n     export — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported platforms.\n  2. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n     with `upload: false`. Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n\n  Example config:\n  ```ts\n  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n  import { homedir } from 'os';\n  import { join } from 'path';\n\n  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    reporter: [\n      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n        upload: false,\n      }),\n      ['html'],\n      ['list'],\n    ],\n    use: {\n      launchOptions: {\n        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":177,"oldLines":12,"newStart":177,"newLines":25,"lines":[" ```"," "," Where `run-tests.sh`:","-- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code","-- If the exit code is non-zero, uses `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent recording","-  with a non-trivial duration (filtering out 1.0ms stub recordings)","-- Uploads that single recording via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <recording-id>`","-- Logs the uploaded recording ID clearly (e.g., `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`)","-- Exits with the original Playwright exit code","+- Removes all stale local recordings from prior runs via `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` before","+  starting, so that only recordings from the current run are present.","+- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code.","+- If the exit code is non-zero:","+  1.

The subtask must require committing and exiting afterwards. Focus on that subtask until finished.\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n   with `upload: false`. Uploads are handled by the post-test script, NOT by the reporter.\n2. Set `launchOptions.executablePath` to the Replay browser path\n   (`~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`). Do NOT use the `devices` export from\n   `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported\n   platforms.\n3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so DOM snapshots are captured.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\nimport { homedir } from 'os';\nimport { join } from 'path';\n\nconst [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['html'],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    launchOptions: {\n      executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n      env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## The `npm run test` Command\n\nEvery app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n\n### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n\n1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n\n2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n\n3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   independent of all previous runs.\n\n4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   of tests.\n\n5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n\n6. **Uploads recordings and logs full metadata on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test`\n   must automatically upload ALL Replay recordings from the run that have a non-trivial\n   duration (filtering out 1ms stubs and in-progress recordings). For each uploaded recording,\n   the script must log its full metadata (ID, date, duration, URI, status) so that any\n   recording — not just one — can be used for Replay MCP analysis. The script uses\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to get structured metadata, filters to finished recordings with\n   duration > 100ms, uploads each one, and prints the full metadata block for every recording.\n   After all uploads, it also cleans up local recordings with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n\n### Implementation pattern:\n\nThe `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\nUse a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\nthe post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `run-tests.sh`:\n- Removes all stale local recordings from prior runs via `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` before\n  starting, so that only recordings from the current run are present.\n- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code.\n- If the exit code is non-zero:\n  1. Runs `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` and parses the JSON to find all recordings with\n     `recordingStatus == \"finished\"` and `duration > 100` (filtering out 1ms stubs and\n     in-progress recordings).\n  2. For each matching recording, uploads it via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n  3. Logs the full metadata for every recording found (ID, date, duration, URI, status),\n     not just the uploaded ones, in a clearly delimited block:\n     ```\n     === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n     {\"id\":\"...\",\"date\":\"...\",\"duration\":1234,\"uri\":\"...\",\"status\":\"finished\"}\n     ...\n     === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n     ```\n  4. Logs each successful upload as `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n  5. After uploads, cleans up with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n- Exits with the original Playwright exit code.\n\nWhere `setup-test-branch`:\n- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n- Seeds the branch with test data\n- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n\nThe Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\ndeletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n`DATABASE_URL`.\n\nExtra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nEvery time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n\nTests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\nor with the production database.\n\n**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\nbranch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\nworker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\nisolated branch.\n\n**How it works**:\n\n1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n     schema is current.\n   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n\n2. **Worker execution**:\n   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n     to pass the correct URL.\n   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n     data contamination is possible.\n\n3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n\n**Key requirements**:\n- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads a recording on failure and logs the recording ID (look for\n   `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` in the output). If the upload did not happen (e.g., the\n   post-test script was misconfigured), use `npx [REDACTED]io list` to find the most recent\n   recording with a non-trivial duration and upload it manually: `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n\n- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n  `DATABASE_URL`.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly. Running\n  `npx playwright test` alone will cause tests to use stale or missing database branches.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use the Replay browser and the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package.\n  Specifically:\n  1. Use the Replay browser via `launchOptions.executablePath` pointing at\n     `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`. Do NOT use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`'s `devices`\n     export — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported platforms.\n  2. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n     with `upload: false`. Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n\n  Example config:\n  ```ts\n  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n  import { homedir } from 'os';\n  import { join } from 'path';\n\n  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    reporter: [\n      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n        upload: false,\n      }),\n      ['html'],\n      ['list'],\n    ],\n    use: {\n      launchOptions: {\n        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":268,"oldLines":11,"newStart":268,"newLines":13,"lines":[" mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps."," "," 1.

This section describes\n    32→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    33→\n    34→### 1. Install dependencies\n    35→\n    36→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    37→\n    38→```bash\n    39→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    40→```\n    41→\n    42→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    43→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    44→\n    45→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    46→\n    47→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    48→\n    49→```bash\n    50→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    51→```\n    52→\n    53→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    54→Verify it exists:\n    55→\n    56→```bash\n    57→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    58→```\n    59→\n    60→### 3. API key\n    61→\n    62→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    63→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    64→\n    65→```ts\n    66→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    67→```\n    68→\n    69→### 4. Playwright config\n    70→\n    71→The Playwright config MUST:\n    72→\n    73→1. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n    74→   with `upload: false`. Uploads are handled by the post-test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    75→2. Set `launchOptions.executablePath` to the Replay browser path\n    76→   (`~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`). Do NOT use the `devices` export from\n    77→   `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported\n    78→   platforms.\n    79→3.

Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   124→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   125→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   126→\n   127→## The `npm run test` Command\n   128→\n   129→Every app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n   130→**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n   131→\n   132→### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n   133→\n   134→1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   135→   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   136→   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n   137→\n   138→2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   139→   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   140→   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   141→   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n   142→\n   143→3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   144→   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   145→   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   146→   independent of all previous runs.\n   147→\n   148→4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   149→   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   150→   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   151→   of tests.\n   152→\n   153→5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   154→   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   155→   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   156→   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n   157→\n   158→6. **Uploads recordings and logs full metadata on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test`\n   159→   must automatically upload ALL Replay recordings from the run that have a non-trivial\n   160→   duration (filtering out 1ms stubs and in-progress recordings). For each uploaded recording,\n   161→   the script must log its full metadata (ID, date, duration, URI, status) so that any\n   162→   recording — not just one — can be used for Replay MCP analysis. The script uses\n   163→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to get structured metadata, filters to finished recordings with\n   164→   duration > 100ms, uploads each one, and prints the full metadata block for every recording.\n   165→   After all uploads, it also cleans up local recordings with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n   166→\n   167→### Implementation pattern:\n   168→\n   169→The `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\n   170→Use a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\n   171→the post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n   172→\n   173→```json\n   174→{\n   175→  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n   176→}\n   177→```\n   178→\n   179→Where `run-tests.sh`:\n   180→- Removes all stale local recordings from prior runs via `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` before\n   181→  starting, so that only recordings from the current run are present.\n   182→- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code.\n   183→- If the exit code is non-zero:\n   184→  1. Runs `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` and parses the JSON to find all recordings with\n   185→     `recordingStatus == \"finished\"` and `duration > 100` (filtering out 1ms stubs and\n   186→     in-progress recordings).\n   187→  2. For each matching recording, uploads it via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   188→  3. Logs the full metadata for every recording found (ID, date, duration, URI, status),\n   189→     not just the uploaded ones, in a clearly delimited block:\n   190→     ```\n   191→     === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n   192→     {\"id\":\"...\",\"date\":\"...\",\"duration\":1234,\"uri\":\"...\",\"status\":\"finished\"}\n   193→     ...\n   194→     === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n   195→     ```\n   196→  4. Logs each successful upload as `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n   197→  5. After uploads, cleans up with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n   198→- Exits with the original Playwright exit code.\n   199→\n   200→Where `setup-test-branch`:\n   201→- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n   202→- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n   203→- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n   204→- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n   205→- Seeds the branch with test data\n   206→- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n   207→\n   208→The Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\n   209→deletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n   210→`DATABASE_URL`.\n   211→\n   212→Extra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n   213→`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n   214→\n   215→## Running Tests\n   216→\n   217→Every time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n   218→- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   219→- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n   220→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   221→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   222→\n   223→### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n   224→\n   225→Tests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\n   226→or with the production database.\n   227→\n   228→**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\n   229→branch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\n   230→worker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\n   231→isolated branch.\n   232→\n   233→**How it works**:\n   234→\n   235→1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   236→   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n   237→     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   238→   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n   239→     schema is current.\n   240→   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   241→   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n   242→     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   243→   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n   244→\n   245→2. **Worker execution**:\n   246→   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n   247→     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n   248→     to pass the correct URL.\n   249→   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n   250→     data contamination is possible.\n   251→\n   252→3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   253→   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   254→   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n   255→\n   256→**Key requirements**:\n   257→- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n   258→- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n   259→  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n   260→- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n   261→  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n   262→- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n   263→  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n   264→\n   265→## Debugging\n   266→\n   267→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   268→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   269→\n   270→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   271→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   272→   uploads ALL recordings on failure and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   273→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   274→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   275→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the post-test script was misconfigured), use\n   276→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   277→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   278→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   279→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   280→   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   281→   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   282→   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n   283→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   284→\n   285→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   286→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   287→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   288→\n   289→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   290→\n   291→## Directives\n   292→\n   293→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   294→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   295→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   296→\n   297→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   298→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   299→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   300→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   301→\n   302→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   303→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   304→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   305→\n   306→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   307→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   308→\n   309→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   310→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   311→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   312→\n   313→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n   314→  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n   315→  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n   316→\n   317→- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n   318→  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n   319→  `DATABASE_URL`.\n   320→\n   321→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   322→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   323→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   324→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   325→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   326→\n   327→- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n   328→  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n   329→  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly. Running\n   330→  `npx playwright test` alone will cause tests to use stale or missing database branches.\n   331→\n   332→- The Playwright config MUST use the Replay browser and the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package.\n   333→  Specifically:\n   334→  1. Use the Replay browser via `launchOptions.executablePath` pointing at\n   335→     `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`. Do NOT use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`'s `devices`\n   336→     export — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported platforms.\n   337→  2. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n   338→     with `upload: false`. Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n   339→     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n   340→  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n   341→\n   342→  Example config:\n   343→  ```ts\n   344→  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   345→  import { homedir } from 'os';\n   346→  import { join } from 'path';\n   347→\n   348→  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n   349→\n   350→  export default defineConfig({\n   351→    reporter: [\n   352→      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   353→        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   354→        upload: false,\n   355→      }),\n   356→      ['html'],\n   357→      ['list'],\n   358→    ],\n   359→    use: {\n   360→      launchOptions: {\n   361→        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n   362→        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n   363→      },\n   364→    },\n   365→  });\n   366→  ```\n   367→\n   368→## Tips\n   369→\n   370→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   371→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   372→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   373→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   374→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   375→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   376→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   377→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   378→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   379→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   380→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   381→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   382→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   383→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   384→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   385→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   386→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   387→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   388→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   389→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   390→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   391→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   392→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   393→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   394→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2e3a0adf-1292-47b9-8c8a-7bc3e16a1d6f","uuid":"ddc7b63b-ccda-4ba8-9113-f0c595622e8d","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/tasks/build/testing.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial stage task into a single FixTests task to get all tests passing.\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick a specific failing test and add a subtask to fix that test without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs.

Focus on that subtask until finished.\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n   with `upload: false`. Uploads are handled by the post-test script, NOT by the reporter.\n2. Set `launchOptions.executablePath` to the Replay browser path\n   (`~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`). Do NOT use the `devices` export from\n   `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported\n   platforms.\n3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so DOM snapshots are captured.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\nimport { homedir } from 'os';\nimport { join } from 'path';\n\nconst [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['html'],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    launchOptions: {\n      executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n      env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## The `npm run test` Command\n\nEvery app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n\n### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n\n1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n\n2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n\n3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   independent of all previous runs.\n\n4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   of tests.\n\n5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n\n6. **Uploads recordings and logs full metadata on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test`\n   must automatically upload ALL Replay recordings from the run that have a non-trivial\n   duration (filtering out 1ms stubs and in-progress recordings). For each uploaded recording,\n   the script must log its full metadata (ID, date, duration, URI, status) so that any\n   recording — not just one — can be used for Replay MCP analysis. The script uses\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to get structured metadata, filters to finished recordings with\n   duration > 100ms, uploads each one, and prints the full metadata block for every recording.\n   After all uploads, it also cleans up local recordings with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n\n### Implementation pattern:\n\nThe `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\nUse a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\nthe post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `run-tests.sh`:\n- Removes all stale local recordings from prior runs via `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` before\n  starting, so that only recordings from the current run are present.\n- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code.\n- If the exit code is non-zero:\n  1. Runs `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` and parses the JSON to find all recordings with\n     `recordingStatus == \"finished\"` and `duration > 100` (filtering out 1ms stubs and\n     in-progress recordings).\n  2. For each matching recording, uploads it via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n  3. Logs the full metadata for every recording found (ID, date, duration, URI, status),\n     not just the uploaded ones, in a clearly delimited block:\n     ```\n     === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n     {\"id\":\"...\",\"date\":\"...\",\"duration\":1234,\"uri\":\"...\",\"status\":\"finished\"}\n     ...\n     === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n     ```\n  4. Logs each successful upload as `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n  5. After uploads, cleans up with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n- Exits with the original Playwright exit code.\n\nWhere `setup-test-branch`:\n- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n- Seeds the branch with test data\n- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n\nThe Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\ndeletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n`DATABASE_URL`.\n\nExtra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nEvery time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n\nTests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\nor with the production database.\n\n**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\nbranch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\nworker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\nisolated branch.\n\n**How it works**:\n\n1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n     schema is current.\n   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n\n2. **Worker execution**:\n   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n     to pass the correct URL.\n   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n     data contamination is possible.\n\n3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n\n**Key requirements**:\n- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads ALL recordings on failure and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the post-test script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n\n- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n  `DATABASE_URL`.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly. Running\n  `npx playwright test` alone will cause tests to use stale or missing database branches.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use the Replay browser and the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package.\n  Specifically:\n  1. Use the Replay browser via `launchOptions.executablePath` pointing at\n     `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`. Do NOT use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`'s `devices`\n     export — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported platforms.\n  2. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n     with `upload: false`. Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n\n  Example config:\n  ```ts\n  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n  import { homedir } from 'os';\n  import { join } from 'path';\n\n  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    reporter: [\n      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n        upload: false,\n      }),\n      ['html'],\n      ['list'],\n    ],\n    use: {\n      launchOptions: {\n        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n","numLines":394,"startLine":1,"totalLines":394}}}

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the Replay.io reporter. Let me compile my findings into a clear report.\n\n## Summary: Replay.io Playwright Reporter - Test Metadata Management\n\nI've analyzed the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package to understand how the reporter associates recordings with test results and manages metadata. Here are my findings:\n\n### 1. How the Reporter Associates Recordings with Test Results (Pass/Fail)\n\n**Test Metadata Structure:**\nThe reporter creates test metadata with a `test.result` field that contains one of five values: `\"passed\"`, `\"failed\"`, `\"skipped\"`, `\"timedOut\"`, or `\"unknown\"` (defined in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/node_modules/@[REDACTED]io/playwright/dist/_bundled/@[REDACTED]-cli/shared/recording/metadata/legacy/test/v2.js`).\n\n**Association Mechanism (in `reporter.js` lines 504-522):**\n```javascript\nonTestEnd({\n  tests,                // Array of test objects with result status\n  specFile,\n  [REDACTED]Title,\n  extraMetadata,\n  runnerGroupKey\n})\n```\n\nThe key association happens in `_enqueuePostTestWork` (lines 628-705):\n- The reporter retrieves recordings for a test using `getRecordingsForTest(tests)` which filters recordings by matching the `x-[REDACTED]-test.id` metadata\n- Test results (pass/fail/skip) are extracted from the `test.result` field\n- This result status is included in the test metadata that gets attached to recordings\n\n**Test Result Determination (in `reporter.js` lines 153-166):**\n```javascript\n_getResultFromResultCounts(resultCounts) {\n  if (failed > 0) return \"failed\"\n  else if (timedOut > 0) return \"timedOut\"\n  else if (passed > 0) return \"passed\"\n  else if (skipped > 0) return \"skipped\"\n  else return \"unknown\"\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Metadata Files Written and Their Locations\n\n**Primary Metadata File: `recordings.log`**\nLocation: `$HOME/.[REDACTED]/recordings.log` (or path specified by `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`)\n\n**Recording Log Entry Structure (in `addMetadata.js` lines 11-21):**\n```javascript\n{\n  id: recordingId,\n  kind: \"addMetadata\",\n  metadata: { /* merged metadata */ },\n  timestamp: Date.now()\n}\n```\n\n**Metadata Content:**\nThe reporter appends metadata entries to `recordings.log` containing:\n- Recording ID\n- Merged metadata object including test results, execution IDs, test titles, etc.\n- Timestamp of when metadata was added\n\n**Additional Metadata File: Test Execution Metadata (optional)**\nLocation: Controlled by `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` env var or `$HOME/.[REDACTED]/test-execution-metadata-{workerIndex}` (in `metadata.js` lines 8-10)\n\n### 3. How Recordings Are Marked as Belonging to Failed vs Passed Tests\n\n**Metadata Attachment Process (in `reporter.js` lines 588-627):**\n\nThe reporter builds comprehensive test metadata via `_buildTestMetadata`:\n```javascript\n{\n  approximateDuration,\n  source: { path: specFile, title: test.source.title },\n  result,                    // \"passed\", \"failed\", \"skipped\", \"timedOut\", \"unknown\"\n  resultCounts: { failed, passed, skipped, timedOut, unknown },\n  run: { id, title },\n  tests: [\n    {\n      id,\n      attempt,\n      source: { scope, title },\n      executionGroupId,\n      executionId,\n      maxAttempts,\n      approximateDuration,\n      result,                // Individual test result\n      error: { name, message, line, column }  // Only for failures\n    }\n  ],\n  environment: { errors, pluginVersion, testRunner },\n  schemaVersion: \"2.2.0\"\n}\n```\n\n**Recording Association (in `reporter.js` lines 619-622):**\n```javascript\nrecordings.forEach((rec) => {\n  this._recordingMetadatas.set(rec.id, mergedMetadata);\n  addMetadata(rec.id, mergedMetadata);  // Appends to recordings.log\n});\n```\n\n**Playwright Reporter Integration (in `reporter.js` lines 214-284):**\nThe Playwright-specific reporter:\n1. Processes test attachments to extract execution IDs\n2. Maps test status from Playwright's result object: `result.status` can be \"interrupted\", \"passed\", \"failed\", \"skipped\"\n3. Creates test metadata with test results and error information (lines 251-269)\n4. Calls `this.reporter.getRecordingsForTest(tests)` to retrieve all recordings associated with the test\n5.

On line 31, `addMetadata` does `Object.assign(recording.metadata, metadata)` — this means **all** metadata from the reporter (including the `test` key with result info) IS merged into the recording's metadata. But the CLI's `list --json` only serializes the standard fields.\n\nLet me check what actually gets serialized in JSON output — looking at line 12 of list.js: `console.log(JSON.stringify(recordings, null, 2))` — it serializes the whole recording object. So `metadata.test` WOULD be in the JSON output if the reporter wrote it.\n\nThe problem is that the reporter writes the test metadata as a separate `addMetadata` entry with a key like `\"test\"` inside `metadata`, and the CLI's `getRecordings` merges it via `Object.assign(recording.metadata, metadata)`. So `recording.metadata.test` would contain the test result data.\n\nThis means after a fresh test run, `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` would include `metadata.test.result` (with value `\"failed\"` or `\"passed\"`). The script just needs to read that field.

Focus on that subtask until finished.\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n   with `upload: false`. Uploads are handled by the post-test script, NOT by the reporter.\n2. Set `launchOptions.executablePath` to the Replay browser path\n   (`~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`). Do NOT use the `devices` export from\n   `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported\n   platforms.\n3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so DOM snapshots are captured.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\nimport { homedir } from 'os';\nimport { join } from 'path';\n\nconst [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['html'],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    launchOptions: {\n      executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n      env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## The `npm run test` Command\n\nEvery app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n\n### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n\n1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n\n2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n\n3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   independent of all previous runs.\n\n4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   of tests.\n\n5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n\n6. **Uploads recordings and logs full metadata on failure**: If any test fails, `npm run test`\n   must automatically upload ALL Replay recordings from the run that have a non-trivial\n   duration (filtering out 1ms stubs and in-progress recordings). For each uploaded recording,\n   the script must log its full metadata (ID, date, duration, URI, status) so that any\n   recording — not just one — can be used for Replay MCP analysis. The script uses\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to get structured metadata, filters to finished recordings with\n   duration > 100ms, uploads each one, and prints the full metadata block for every recording.\n   After all uploads, it also cleans up local recordings with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n\n### Implementation pattern:\n\nThe `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\nUse a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\nthe post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `run-tests.sh`:\n- Removes all stale local recordings from prior runs via `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` before\n  starting, so that only recordings from the current run are present.\n- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code.\n- If the exit code is non-zero:\n  1. Runs `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` and parses the JSON to find all recordings with\n     `recordingStatus == \"finished\"` and `duration > 100` (filtering out 1ms stubs and\n     in-progress recordings).\n  2. For each matching recording, uploads it via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n  3. Logs the full metadata for every recording found (ID, date, duration, URI, status),\n     not just the uploaded ones, in a clearly delimited block:\n     ```\n     === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n     {\"id\":\"...\",\"date\":\"...\",\"duration\":1234,\"uri\":\"...\",\"status\":\"finished\"}\n     ...\n     === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n     ```\n  4. Logs each successful upload as `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n  5. After uploads, cleans up with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n- Exits with the original Playwright exit code.\n\nWhere `setup-test-branch`:\n- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n- Seeds the branch with test data\n- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n\nThe Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\ndeletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n`DATABASE_URL`.\n\nExtra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nEvery time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n\nTests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\nor with the production database.\n\n**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\nbranch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\nworker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\nisolated branch.\n\n**How it works**:\n\n1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n     schema is current.\n   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n\n2. **Worker execution**:\n   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n     to pass the correct URL.\n   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n     data contamination is possible.\n\n3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n\n**Key requirements**:\n- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads ALL recordings on failure and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the post-test script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n\n- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n  `DATABASE_URL`.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly. Running\n  `npx playwright test` alone will cause tests to use stale or missing database branches.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use the Replay browser and the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package.\n  Specifically:\n  1. Use the Replay browser via `launchOptions.executablePath` pointing at\n     `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`. Do NOT use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`'s `devices`\n     export — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported platforms.\n  2. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n     with `upload: false`. Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n\n  Example config:\n  ```ts\n  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n  import { homedir } from 'os';\n  import { join } from 'path';\n\n  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    reporter: [\n      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n        upload: false,\n      }),\n      ['html'],\n      ['list'],\n    ],\n    use: {\n      launchOptions: {\n        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":155,"oldLines":14,"newStart":155,"newLines":15,"lines":["    Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding.

The subtask must require committing and exiting afterwards. Focus on that subtask until finished.\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n   with `upload: false`. Uploads are handled by the post-test script, NOT by the reporter.\n2. Set `launchOptions.executablePath` to the Replay browser path\n   (`~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`). Do NOT use the `devices` export from\n   `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported\n   platforms.\n3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so DOM snapshots are captured.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\nimport { homedir } from 'os';\nimport { join } from 'path';\n\nconst [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['html'],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    launchOptions: {\n      executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n      env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## The `npm run test` Command\n\nEvery app MUST have an `npm run test` command (defined in the app's `package.json`) that is\n**completely self-contained and idempotent**. This is the single entry point for running tests.\n\n### Hard requirements for `npm run test`:\n\n1. **Resets all state**: It must kill any stale dev servers, clean up leftover database branches\n   from previous runs, create fresh ephemeral database branches, initialize schema, and seed data.\n   No manual cleanup step should ever be needed between runs.\n\n2. **Needs no special configuration**: It must work with only the environment variables that are\n   already set in the container (e.g., `NEON_API_KEY`, `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY`, database credentials).\n   A developer should be able to run `cd apps/<AppName> && npm run test` and have it work on the\n   first try with no prior setup, no manual server starts, and no extra flags.\n\n3. **Passes when run repeatedly**: Running `npm run test` twice (or N times) in a row must produce\n   passing results every time. There must be no accumulated state, no leftover branches, no port\n   conflicts, and no stale data that causes the second run to fail. Each run must be fully\n   independent of all previous runs.\n\n4. **Supports file filtering**: `npm run test -- tests/some-spec.spec.ts` must work to run only\n   matching test files, while still performing all the same setup/teardown (branch creation,\n   schema init, seeding, server startup). The setup must not be skipped when running a subset\n   of tests.\n\n5. **Handles interruptions gracefully**: If a previous run was killed mid-execution (Ctrl+C,\n   OOM, crash), the next `npm run test` must detect and clean up any orphaned resources (stale\n   Neon branches, zombie server processes on test ports) before proceeding. It must never fail\n   because of leftover state from a crashed run.\n\n6. **Uploads only failing recordings and logs full metadata**: If any test fails, `npm run test`\n   must automatically upload only the Replay recordings associated with **failed** tests, and\n   log full metadata for ALL recordings (both passed and failed). The `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`\n   reporter writes test result metadata to each recording — the `metadata.test.result` field\n   is set to `\"failed\"`, `\"passed\"`, `\"timedOut\"`, or `\"unknown\"`. The script uses\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to get structured metadata, filters to finished recordings where\n   `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, uploads only those, and prints the\n   full metadata block for every recording (so the debugging agent can see all of them).\n   After all uploads, it cleans up local recordings with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n\n### Implementation pattern:\n\nThe `npm run test` script should chain: pre-test setup → playwright test → post-test upload.\nUse a wrapper script (e.g., `scripts/run-tests.sh`) to capture the Playwright exit code, run\nthe post-test upload on failure, and then exit with the original code. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"test\": \"npm run setup-test-branch && bash scripts/run-tests.sh\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `run-tests.sh`:\n- Removes all stale local recordings from prior runs via `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` before\n  starting, so that only recordings from the current run are present.\n- Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code.\n- If the exit code is non-zero:\n  1. Runs `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` and parses the JSON to find all recordings with\n     `recordingStatus == \"finished\"` and `duration > 100` (filtering out 1ms stubs and\n     in-progress recordings).\n  2. For each matching recording, uploads it via `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n  3. Logs the full metadata for every recording found (ID, date, duration, URI, status),\n     not just the uploaded ones, in a clearly delimited block:\n     ```\n     === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n     {\"id\":\"...\",\"date\":\"...\",\"duration\":1234,\"uri\":\"...\",\"status\":\"finished\"}\n     ...\n     === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n     ```\n  4. Logs each successful upload as `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n  5. After uploads, cleans up with `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all`.\n- Exits with the original Playwright exit code.\n\nWhere `setup-test-branch`:\n- Kills any existing dev server on the test port\n- Cleans up stale Neon branches from interrupted runs (by naming convention)\n- Creates a fresh ephemeral Neon branch\n- Initializes schema and runs migrations on it\n- Seeds the branch with test data\n- Writes branch connection info to a file that the Playwright `webServer` config reads\n\nThe Playwright config's `globalSetup` generates auth tokens/storage state. The `globalTeardown`\ndeletes the ephemeral branch. The `webServer` config starts the dev server with the branch's\n`DATABASE_URL`.\n\nExtra args are forwarded automatically — `npm run test -- --grep \"search\"` or\n`npm run test -- tests/foo.spec.ts` passes through to `npx playwright test`.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nEvery time you run the playwright tests, do the following:\n- Use `npm run test` from the app directory. Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n- Use the Replay browser to record test executions.\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n### Parallel Test Execution with Isolated Databases\n\nTests must run in parallel using isolated database branches so they never interfere with each other\nor with the production database.\n\n**Architecture**: Each Playwright worker gets its own Neon database branch, created from the main\nbranch during global setup and destroyed during global teardown. The dev server receives the\nworker's `DATABASE_URL` via environment variable so all API calls from that worker hit its\nisolated branch.\n\n**How it works**:\n\n1. **Global setup** (`globalSetup`):\n   - Use the Neon API to create a temporary branch from the main Neon project branch for each\n     parallel worker. Name branches like `test-worker-{run-id}-{worker-index}`.\n   - Run the app's `initSchema` function (see writeApp.md) against each branch to ensure the\n     schema is current.\n   - Run the seed script against each branch to populate test data.\n   - Write each branch's connection string to a file or env var that the corresponding worker\n     can read (e.g., `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_0`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL_WORKER_1`, etc.).\n   - Generate the test JWT and write the storage state file.\n\n2. **Worker execution**:\n   - Each Playwright worker's dev server must start with `DATABASE_URL` pointing to its\n     dedicated branch. Use Playwright's `webServer` config or a project-per-worker setup\n     to pass the correct URL.\n   - Tests within a worker run against that worker's isolated branch — no cross-worker\n     data contamination is possible.\n\n3. **Global teardown** (`globalTeardown`):\n   - Delete all temporary Neon branches created during setup using the Neon API.\n   - This ensures no branch accumulation over time.\n\n**Key requirements**:\n- The production/main database is NEVER used during tests. Tests only touch ephemeral branches.\n- Branch creation uses the Neon branching API (`POST /projects/{id}/branches`), which provides\n  copy-on-write branches that are fast to create and free to delete.\n- The app's `initSchema` function (exported from a shared module, see writeApp.md) is used to\n  set up the schema on each branch — the same function used during deployment.\n- If branch creation fails (e.g., API rate limit), the test run must fail immediately with a\n  clear error rather than falling back to the main database.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads ALL recordings on failure and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the post-test script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Start with `mcp__[REDACTED]__ConsoleMessages` and\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__NetworkRequest` to get an overview, then drill into specifics with tools like\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__SearchSources`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Logpoint`, `mcp__[REDACTED]__Evaluate`,\n   `mcp__[REDACTED]__GetStack`, and `mcp__[REDACTED]__ReactComponents` as needed.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. Global setup must\n  create ephemeral Neon branches for test workers and global teardown must delete them. If a test\n  run is interrupted, stale branches should be cleaned up on the next run (detect by naming convention).\n\n- Each Playwright worker must have its own dev server instance pointing at its own database branch.\n  Use Playwright projects or a per-worker webServer config to assign each worker a unique port and\n  `DATABASE_URL`.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test` (from the app directory), never by calling `npx playwright test`\n  directly. The `npm run test` command includes essential pre-test setup (branch creation, schema\n  init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly. Running\n  `npx playwright test` alone will cause tests to use stale or missing database branches.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use the Replay browser and the `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` package.\n  Specifically:\n  1. Use the Replay browser via `launchOptions.executablePath` pointing at\n     `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`. Do NOT use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`'s `devices`\n     export — it may return `undefined` for `executablePath` on unsupported platforms.\n  2. Import `[REDACTED]Reporter` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and include it in the `reporter` array\n     with `upload: false`. Do NOT set `upload: true` — uploads are handled by the post-test\n     script in `run-tests.sh`, not by the reporter.\n  3. Set `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1'` in `launchOptions.env` so that DOM snapshots are captured.\n\n  Example config:\n  ```ts\n  import { [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n  import { homedir } from 'os';\n  import { join } from 'path';\n\n  const [REDACTED]Browser = join(homedir(), '.[REDACTED]', 'runtimes', 'chrome-linux', 'chrome');\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    reporter: [\n      [REDACTED]Reporter({\n        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n        upload: false,\n      }),\n      ['html'],\n      ['list'],\n    ],\n    use: {\n      launchOptions: {\n        executablePath: [REDACTED]Browser,\n        env: { ...process.env, RECORD_ALL_CONTENT: '1' },\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n## Tips\n\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":182,"oldLines":20,"newStart":182,"newLines":22,"lines":["   starting, so that only recordings from the current run are present."," - Runs `npx playwright test \"$@\"` and captures its exit code."," - If the exit code is non-zero:","-  1.

Let me re-check the `_registerExecutedProject` check more carefully. On line 110 of reporter.js: `usesReplayBrowser: project.use.launchOptions?.executablePath === getRuntimePath.getRuntimePath()`. Our config passes `executablePath` in `use.launchOptions`, and the project also inherits from `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. The Playwright project config merges these. Let me verify the actual resolved value at runtime.\n\nActually, wait. Let me look at the `onTestEnd` flow more carefully.

So if we set that env var in the browser launch env, the fixture will use that path **regardless** of the worker index calculation. The recording driver will also read from it. So it works because:\n\n1. Config sets `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` to `PLAYWRIGHT_METADATA_0` in the env\n2. Each worker inherits that env, so the fixture writes to the same file\n3. But wait — that means all workers write to the same file, which would be racy with parallel workers...\n\nActually looking again: the fixture computes `metadataFilePath` at module load time (line 24 of fixture.js), which is once per worker process. But `getMetadataFilePath` reads `process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` at that point. In our case, we're NOT setting that env var, so it falls through to the path computation with `workerIndex`, which is correct per-worker.\n\nThe problem is simpler than I thought. The recording driver needs `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` in its env to know where to read metadata from. Without it, recordings don't get the `x-[REDACTED]-test` metadata. The `devices` export sets it; our manual config doesn't.\n\nThe simplest fix: use the `devices` export from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` instead of manually setting `executablePath`.
