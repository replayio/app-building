If the bug is about existing functionality, the test entries are\n   underspecified and the problem stage is `testSpec.md` (`strategies/tasks/build/`) which covers generation of the spec.\n\n## Updating directives\n\nIf non problem stage was identified for the bug report, skip this task.\n\nRead the strategy file for the stage which breaks down how to perform the stage into\nincreasingly small and well defined tasks. These strategy files have directives for things to watch\nfor when performing a task, which are reviewed afterwards and while maintaining the app to make sure\nthey are all being followed.\n\nCheck to see if the directives already prohibit the bad behavior. If so, add a note on the entry in\nbugReports.md but make no other changes.\n\nIf there is no directive against the bad behavior, add one or update any similar / conflicting directive.\nAdd a note on the entry in bugReports.md about the update made.\n\nDirectives should be general purpose and not include details or examples specific to the app being built.\n\n## Finishing bugs\n\nUpdate `docs/bugReports.md` to move the report from the \"Unreviewed\" section to the \"Finished\" section,\ncreating it at the end if necessary.\n\nCommit all changes and exit.\n","numLines":65,"startLine":1,"totalLines":65}}}

Let me analyze each one:\n\n**Bug 1: Authentication system** - The app had no authentication. The test spec at `df7222c` already had 18 references to auth-related terms, but the bug report says authentication was added as new functionality. This is a request for new functionality (no authentication existed before), so there is **no problem stage**.\n\n**Bug 2: Task links don't work** - The test spec at `ef67c9a` had CDP-TSK-03 specifying \"Clicking a task navigates to task context\" — navigating to the deal detail page if associated with a deal. The fix changed this to navigate to `/tasks/:taskId` instead. The old spec specified the behavior that was changed (navigating to deal detail). The TaskDetailPage was added in a previous maintenance round, which changed the expected navigation target. This is a **change in app requirements** — the spec specified the old behavior, so there is **no problem stage**.\n\n**Bug 3: Pipeline drag-and-drop** - The test spec at `4e63501` described the pipeline view as a display-only kanban board with no mention of drag-and-drop. This is **new functionality** being requested, so there is **no problem stage**.\n\n**Bug 4: Deal attachment uploads** - The test spec at `fbafcda` had DDP-ATT-02 saying \"Upload icon opens file upload dialog\" and DDP-ATT-03 saying \"Uploading a file adds it to attachments list\" — the spec clearly specified file upload functionality. But the actual implementation only had link entry, not file upload. The spec described the correct behavior but the app didn't implement it. This means the tests weren't catching it properly.

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/tasks/reviewChanges.md`,\n  `/repo/strategies/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":30,"oldLines":6,"newStart":30,"newLines":11,"lines":["   writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing","   spec files to use the same testid values."," ","+- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a","+  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's","+  `setInputFiles` on a file input).
