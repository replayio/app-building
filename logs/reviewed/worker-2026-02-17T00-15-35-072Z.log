If so, add a note on the entry in\nbugReports.md but make no other changes.\n\nIf there is no directive against the bad behavior, add one or update any similar / conflicting directive.\nAdd a note on the entry in bugReports.md about the update made.\n\nDirectives should be general purpose and not include details or examples specific to the app being built.\n\n## Finishing bugs\n\nUpdate `docs/bugReports.md` to move the report from the \"Unreviewed\" section to the \"Finished\" section,\ncreating it at the end if necessary.\n\nCommit all changes and exit.\n","numLines":65,"startLine":1,"totalLines":65}}}

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    28→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    29→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    30→\n    31→## Directives\n    32→\n    33→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    34→\n    35→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    36→\n    37→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    38→\n    39→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\n    40→\n    41→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    42→\n    43→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    44→\n    45→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    46→\n    47→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    48→\n    49→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    50→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    51→\n    52→## Tips\n    53→\n    54→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    55→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    56→- When starting from scratch with no existing plan.md, create and commit plan.md before moving on\n    57→  to PlanPage tasks. This avoids losing the plan if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    58→- The PlanPages task must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it contains subsequent changes to the spec from bug\nreports and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into the following:\n\n- PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on the pages the app needs, and add a PlanPage<Name> subtask for each page.\n\n- PlanPage<Name>: Decide on the components the page needs, add sections for the page and its components to docs/tests.md, and add a PlanComponent<Name> subtask for each of those components. IMPORTANT: The last task done to specify the test entries for each page must require committing and exiting afterwards.\n\n- PlanComponent<Name>: Add test entries to comprehensively test the component's behavior.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing plan.md, create and commit plan.md before moving on\n  to PlanPage tasks. This avoids losing the plan if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages task must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  plan.md, commit, and exit. A zero-commit iteration is always a failure — prioritize writing\n  output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":65,"startLine":1,"totalLines":65}}}
