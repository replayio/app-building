See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `strategy`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `tasks.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same strategy. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

The app is tracking the inventory held of a variety of categorized materials and is broadly similar to an accounting platform.  There is a global set of accounts (inventory, consumer, producer) which can be customized, and within each account there are a variety of materials and their quantity (in customizable units).  Each account / material can be further subdivided into batches where the amount of material in each batch is tracked separately.  Transactions can be recorded and use a double entry system where credits / debits must balance.  Transactions can either reuse batches or create new ones.  newly created batches remember the lineage of batches they were created from.\n\nPages:\n\n1.

Let me inventory all the elements:\n\n**Header area:**\n- Breadcrumb: \"Home / Transactions\" \n- \"New Transaction\" button (blue, top right)\n\n**Filters section:**\n- \"Filters\" label with \"Clear Filters\" button to the right\n- Date Range: calendar picker showing \"Oct 1, 2023 - Oct 31, 2023\"\n- Involved Account(s): multi-select showing \"Raw Materials Inventory (1200), Accounts Payable (2100) (2 selected)\"\n- Material: multi-select showing \"Steel Plates (M001), Plastic Pellets (M002) (2 selected)\"\n\n\n- Transaction Type: dropdown showing \"All Types (Purchase, Consumption, Transfer...)\"\n\n**Search and display controls:**\n- Search bar with icon and placeholder \"Search by ID or description...\"\n- Sort dropdown set to \"Date (Newest First)\"\n- Results counter showing \"Showing 1-10 of 145 results\"\n\n**Data table:**\n- Columns for Date, Transaction ID, Description, Accounts affected (with Dr/Cr notation), and Materials with amounts\n- Clickable rows that navigate to transaction details\n- Pagination controls at the bottom with First/Previous/Next/Last buttons, page numbers, and a rows-per-page selector\n\nI can see the structure now. The tests.md file already has the page scaffold with TransactionsFilterBar, TransactionsTable, and Pagination components listed. For the first subtask, I need to finalize the component breakdown and update the documentation accordingly.\n\nLooking at the mockup more carefully, I'm identifying the full set of components: TransactionsFilterBar (with date range, account multi-select, material multi-select, transaction type dropdown, and clear filters), TransactionsSearchBar for ID/description search, TransactionsTable with all columns, Pagination, NewTransactionButton, and Breadcrumb navigation. The subtask descriptions suggest these components will each get their own planning and testing entries. I should check if breadcrumbs are tested elsewhere—looking at the TransactionDetailPage tests, they do have breadcrumb coverage, so I'll add similar tests here. Now I'm mapping out the actual components based on the subtasks: TransactionsFilterBar handles the search and filters, while TransactionsTable manages the sorting, pagination, and results display, so I'll update the component list to reflect this structure. I'll organize the test structure by following the subtask breakdown: first the page-level tests for the breadcrumb and navigation, then the filter bar tests, and finally the table tests. Let me start writing out the test cases for each section. Finishing up the pagination controls and rows-per-page selector, then I need to write out the complete test suite for the TransactionsPage, organizing tests by component and making sure every interactive element is covered with proper BDD structure. update the component list and add the page-level tests (breadcrumb, navigation). Then subtasks 2 and 3 will add the component-specific tests.\n\nActually, I should do all three subtasks together since they all modify the same section. Let me write the complete replacement.\n\nLet me think carefully about what the mockup shows and write comprehensive tests for the filter bar, covering date range selection, account and material filtering, transaction type selection, and search functionality. Then I need to map out the table tests—checking that all columns render correctly, dates are formatted and sortable, and the various data fields display properly with the appropriate notation for accounts. I'm reviewing the specific formatting details from the mockup—the pagination layout with First/Previous/page numbers/Next/Last buttons, the sort dropdown showing \"Date (Newest First)\", and the results counter displaying \"Showing 1-10 of 145 results\". I'm also noting the exact column formats: accounts affected shows debit and credit accounts with codes, materials column lists items with codes, quantities, and prices, and some rows have multiple materials or show \"N/A\" for certain transaction types. Now I'm ready to map out the actual test data from the mockup starting with the first transaction row from October 27, 2023. I'm seeing the rest of the transaction log with utility expenses and additional raw material purchases, and it looks like there's pagination showing 10 rows per page. Now I have enough context to start building out the component structure, beginning with the TransactionsFilterBar.\n\nLooking at the subtask breakdown, I need to organize the components carefully—TransactionsTable should encompass the sorting, pagination, and new transaction button functionality, so I'll list the main components as TransactionsFilterBar, TransactionsTable, and NewTransactionButton, keeping pagination nested within the table component
