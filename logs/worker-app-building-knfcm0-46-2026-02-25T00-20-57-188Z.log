Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8006c829-7ed7-4ca9-b1fe-a91238c62b82","uuid":"7e7d8f5a-1f0f-4aa5-b0e8-7a8e62d6ba79","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8006c829-7ed7-4ca9-b1fe-a91238c62b82","uuid":"411734e8-90e4-4c67-9103-0ff000a671a7","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

KEY PATTERNS & CONVENTIONS\n\n**Component Patterns:**\n1. **Container/Presentational:** Pages fetch data, components display it\n2. **Modal Pattern:** Inline modals with local state (`useState`)\n3. **Edit-in-place:** Components toggle between view and edit modes\n4. **Confirmation Dialogs:** Delete actions always show confirm dialog\n\n**Redux Patterns:**\n1. **Async Thunks:** All API calls are async thunks\n2. **Conditional Loading:** Only set loading=true if data not already present\n3. **Optimistic Updates:** Delete updates state immediately\n4. **State Cleanup:** useEffect cleanup dispatches clearCurrentEquipment\n\n**API Patterns:**\n1. **URL-based routing:** IDs extracted from URL path segments\n2. **Query params:** For optional filters (e.g., equipment_id for notes)\n3. **COALESCE:** For partial updates (only update provided fields)\n4. **RETURNING *:** Always return updated/created record\n\n**Styling Patterns:**\n1. **BEM-like naming:** `.section-card`, `.section-card-header`, `.badge--operational`\n2. **Utility classes:** `.btn-primary`, `.form-input`, `.page-content`\n3. **Status variants:** `-{status}` suffix for status-specific styles\n4. **Responsive:** Max-width media queries for mobile\n\n**Error Handling:**\n1. **Redux:** Store errors in state, display in components\n2. **Network:** 404/500 responses caught by try-catch\n3. **User feedback:** Error messages displayed in page content\n\n---\n\n### 11. EXISTING PATTERNS FOR NEW RECIPE FEATURES\n\n**When Building Recipe Pages, Follow These Patterns:**\n\n1. **Create a recipesSlice.ts** similar to equipmentSlice.ts with:\n   - Async thunks: fetchRecipes, fetchRecipeById, createRecipe, updateRecipe, deleteRecipe\n   - State: items[], currentRecipe, loading, error\n   - Reducers: clearCurrentRecipe action\n\n2. **Create pages:**\n   - RecipePage.tsx - List with pagination\n   - RecipeDetailsPage.tsx - Detail view with edit capability\n\n3. **Create components:**\n   - RecipeHeader.tsx - Page title + Add button\n   - RecipeTable.tsx - List table with edit/delete actions\n   - RecipeDetailHeader.tsx - Breadcrumb + title + status badge\n   - RecipeForm.tsx or RecipeInfo.tsx - Editable fields\n   - RecipeMaterialsSection.tsx - Sub-items management\n   - RecipeProductsSection.tsx - Sub-items management\n   - RecipeEquipmentSection.tsx - Equipment selection\n\n4. **Create Netlify functions:**\n   - recipes.ts - Main CRUD\n   - recipe-materials.ts - Material management\n   - recipe-products.ts - Product management\n   - recipe-equipment.ts - Equipment assignment\n\n5. **Follow styling conventions:**\n   - Use .section-card for grouped content\n   - Use .badge--{status} for status display\n   - Use modals for inline creation/editing\n   - Use shared ConfirmDialog for deletions\n   - Use .form-* classes for form inputs\n\n6. **Use shared components:**\n   - Breadcrumb for navigation\n   - Pagination for lists\n   - CommentsSection for notes (if applicable)\n   - ConfirmDialog for delete confirmations\n\n---\n\n### 12.

KEY PATTERNS & CONVENTIONS\n\n**Component Patterns:**\n1. **Container/Presentational:** Pages fetch data, components display it\n2. **Modal Pattern:** Inline modals with local state (`useState`)\n3. **Edit-in-place:** Components toggle between view and edit modes\n4. **Confirmation Dialogs:** Delete actions always show confirm dialog\n\n**Redux Patterns:**\n1. **Async Thunks:** All API calls are async thunks\n2. **Conditional Loading:** Only set loading=true if data not already present\n3. **Optimistic Updates:** Delete updates state immediately\n4. **State Cleanup:** useEffect cleanup dispatches clearCurrentEquipment\n\n**API Patterns:**\n1. **URL-based routing:** IDs extracted from URL path segments\n2. **Query params:** For optional filters (e.g., equipment_id for notes)\n3. **COALESCE:** For partial updates (only update provided fields)\n4. **RETURNING *:** Always return updated/created record\n\n**Styling Patterns:**\n1. **BEM-like naming:** `.section-card`, `.section-card-header`, `.badge--operational`\n2. **Utility classes:** `.btn-primary`, `.form-input`, `.page-content`\n3. **Status variants:** `-{status}` suffix for status-specific styles\n4. **Responsive:** Max-width media queries for mobile\n\n**Error Handling:**\n1. **Redux:** Store errors in state, display in components\n2. **Network:** 404/500 responses caught by try-catch\n3. **User feedback:** Error messages displayed in page content\n\n---\n\n### 11. EXISTING PATTERNS FOR NEW RECIPE FEATURES\n\n**When Building Recipe Pages, Follow These Patterns:**\n\n1. **Create a recipesSlice.ts** similar to equipmentSlice.ts with:\n   - Async thunks: fetchRecipes, fetchRecipeById, createRecipe, updateRecipe, deleteRecipe\n   - State: items[], currentRecipe, loading, error\n   - Reducers: clearCurrentRecipe action\n\n2. **Create pages:**\n   - RecipePage.tsx - List with pagination\n   - RecipeDetailsPage.tsx - Detail view with edit capability\n\n3. **Create components:**\n   - RecipeHeader.tsx - Page title + Add button\n   - RecipeTable.tsx - List table with edit/delete actions\n   - RecipeDetailHeader.tsx - Breadcrumb + title + status badge\n   - RecipeForm.tsx or RecipeInfo.tsx - Editable fields\n   - RecipeMaterialsSection.tsx - Sub-items management\n   - RecipeProductsSection.tsx - Sub-items management\n   - RecipeEquipmentSection.tsx - Equipment selection\n\n4. **Create Netlify functions:**\n   - recipes.ts - Main CRUD\n   - recipe-materials.ts - Material management\n   - recipe-products.ts - Product management\n   - recipe-equipment.ts - Equipment assignment\n\n5. **Follow styling conventions:**\n   - Use .section-card for grouped content\n   - Use .badge--{status} for status display\n   - Use modals for inline creation/editing\n   - Use shared ConfirmDialog for deletions\n   - Use .form-* classes for form inputs\n\n6. **Use shared components:**\n   - Breadcrumb for navigation\n   - Pagination for lists\n   - CommentsSection for notes (if applicable)\n   - ConfirmDialog for delete confirmations\n\n---\n\n### 12.

But the test spec uses IDs like \"HPP-B1\" - these are the actual recipe IDs from the database. Since the DB uses UUIDs, I should use the full UUID (or use a custom ID). Wait, the test says \"HPP-B1\" as the ID. But the schema uses UUID primary keys. The tests will seed data with specific UUIDs. \n\nThe test spec shows recipe IDs like \"HPP-B1\", \"E-101\", \"C-205\" rather than UUIDs, so there's a mismatch between what the tests expect and what the schema provides. I need to figure out whether the tests will seed custom IDs or if I should display a shortened version of the UUID. I'm realizing the test IDs like \"HPP-B1\" and \"E-4021\" aren't UUIDs at all—they're custom formatted IDs. Since the EquipmentDetailHeader just displays the equipment ID directly, I should do the same with the recipe ID rather than trying to parse or truncate it. I see the tests expect the recipe name followed by its ID in parentheses, like \"High-Performance Polymer Blend (HPP-B1)\". I need to stop truncating the UUID and just display the full `recipe.id` as-is, matching what the EquipmentDetailHeader
