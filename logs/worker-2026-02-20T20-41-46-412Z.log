Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints.

The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   245→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   246→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   247→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   248→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken.

Let me re-read the job requirements to confirm what exactly needs to be changed.\n\nThe testSpec directive is clear: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\" Since CDP-TL-01 and CDP-TL-02 mention clickable links but don't specify where they navigate to, I need to either remove the link references or add the navigation targets. The job says to remove them, so I'll strip out the \"clickable link\" language from those two entries. Let me look more carefully at the actual test code and app implementation to see where these clickable links are appearing, since the job mentions all four test cases but I'm only seeing explicit link references in some of them. Looking at the test spec again, I need to focus on what the job description actually asks for—removing unspecified \"clickable link\" references from the timeline user attribution entries. For CDP-TL-01 and CDP-TL-02, the fixes are clear: strip out the \"with link\" and \"clickable link\" language. But CDP-TL-04 and CDP-TL-06 don't seem to have that explicit language in their current text, so I should check if there's something I'm missing or if those entries are already compliant. I'm realizing the issue might be simpler—the job is asking me to remove the \"clickable link\" mentions from CDP-TL-01 and CDP-TL-02 since they don't specify where those links actually go, while CDP-TL-04 and CDP-TL-06 don't have this problem because they don't claim the user attribution is clickable. Let me check if there are any other references to links in those entries that need cleaning up.\n\nNow I'm looking at CDP-QA-07, which describes what happens when an attachment is uploaded but doesn't mention whether a timeline entry gets created—I need to verify if that's supposed to be part of the expected behavior.\n\nI also notice the FollowButton test cases are currently listed under

[2026-02-20T20:36:08.483Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_011v7STwbwQLrcKsbbL8Tmeh","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear understanding of all three violations:\n\n1. **CDP-TL-01/02 have \"clickable link\" / \"with link\" for user attribution** - these need to be removed since no navigation target is specified\n   - CDP-TL-01 (line 514): \"user attribution with link\" → \"user attribution\"\n   - CDP-TL-02 (line 519): Remove \"'User A' is a clickable link.\" sentence\n   - CDP-TL-04 and CDP-TL-06: I need to check if these also mention \"link\" - from what I've read, they don't. But the job description specifically says these too. Let me re-read the exact text.\n   \nLooking back at the actual entries, CDP-TL-04 and CDP-TL-06 just show \"by User B\" and \"by User C\" without any link references, so it seems only CDP-TL-01 and CDP-TL-02 actually contain the problematic link language that needs fixing. and CDP-TL-02 specifically have the violation, and CDP-TL-04 and CDP-TL-06 are listed as related entries. Or maybe the fix is that those entries also need \"by User X\" removed since the user attribution might also imply a link if the app renders user names as links.\n\nHmm, I think the intention is:\n- CDP-TL-01: Remove \"with link\" from \"user attribution with link\"\n- CDP-TL-02: Remove \"'User A' is a clickable link.\" \n- CDP-TL-04: Check if there's a link mention - there isn't in the text, so maybe the test code is checking for a link?\n- CDP-TL-06: Same\n\nLet me check the test code to see if the tests are checking for clickable links.\n\nActually, looking at the job description more carefully, it's referencing all four entries CDP-TL-01 through 06. CDP-TL-04 and CDP-TL-06 both have \"by User B\" and \"by User C\" without explicit link mentions, so maybe the issue is that the test code is detecting these user attributions as clickable links too, and the fix needs to address that across all four entries. I realize CDP-TL-04 is about notes and CDP-TL-06 is about contact additions, so I need to check the actual test files to see if there are any \"by User\" references with link anchors in them.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4780,"cache_read_input_tokens":43477,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4780,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e696a292-d04e-42a4-bdd6-d6917ce9cdaf","uuid":"8fc3b729-d3cb-4034

The test seems to be checking for timeline event descriptions instead.\n\nSo the real issue is that the test spec document has violations around link mentions, not the test code itself. I need to clean up the test spec by removing references to links from CDP-TL-01 and CDP-TL-02, and then figure out what's actually happening with CDP-TL-04 and CDP-TL-06 since they mention user attribution but don't explicitly reference links. Looking back at the job description more carefully, it seems all four test cases (CDP-TL-01, CDP-TL-02, CDP-TL-04, and CDP-TL-06) need the \"clickable link\" language removed from their user attribution specs. CDP-TL-01 and CDP-TL-02 explicitly mention links and need updates, while CDP-TL-04 and CDP-TL-06 might be rendering links unintentionally despite the spec not mentioning them—but since the task is about fixing the test spec itself, I should focus on removing any link references from all four entries.","signature":"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

Unspecified clickable link in timeline user attribution (CDP-TL-01, CDP-TL-02)\n**Directive violated**: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\nCDP-TL-01 described user attribution \"with link\" and CDP-TL-02 stated \"'User A' is a clickable link\" — but neither specified where the link navigates. The app renders user attribution as a plain `<span>`, not a link, so the spec was inaccurate.\n\n**Fix**: Removed \"with link\" from CDP-TL-01 and removed \"'User A' is a clickable link.\" from CDP-TL-02.\n\n### 2. Missing timeline entry verification in CDP-QA-07\n**Directive violated**: \"If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry.\"\n\nCDP-QA-07 (attachment upload) did not mention a timeline entry being created, unlike other quick action entries (CDP-QA-03, CDP-QA-05, CDP-QA-09) which all verify timeline entries.\n\n**Fix**: Added \"A timeline entry is created for the attachment upload.\" to CDP-QA-07's Expected section.\n\n### 3.

Unspecified clickable link in timeline user attribution (CDP-TL-01, CDP-TL-02)\n**Directive violated**: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\nCDP-TL-01 described user attribution \"with link\" and CDP-TL-02 stated \"'User A' is a clickable link\" — but neither specified where the link navigates. The app renders user attribution as a plain `<span>`, not a link, so the spec was inaccurate.\n\n**Fix**: Removed \"with link\" from CDP-TL-01 and removed \"'User A' is a clickable link.\" from CDP-TL-02.\n\n### 2. Missing timeline entry verification in CDP-QA-07\n**Directive violated**: \"If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry.\"\n\nCDP-QA-07 (attachment upload) did not mention a timeline entry being created, unlike other quick action entries (CDP-QA-03, CDP-QA-05, CDP-QA-09) which all verify timeline entries.\n\n**Fix**: Added \"A timeline entry is created for the attachment upload.\" to CDP-QA-07's Expected section.\n\n### 3.
