Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 for Team nav item. Created users-page.spec.ts with 6 tests. All pass.\n  - [x] fixBugReport.md: UpdateRevisionsUsersPage: Recorded spec change in AppRevisions.md\n  - [x] fixBugReport.md: ResolveBugUsersPage: Bug moved to Unreviewed in bugReports.md\n- [x] reviewBugReport.md: UnpackReviewBugReport: Classified and reviewed 4 bugs — 3 no problem stage (users page=new functionality, settings page=new functionality, CSV import all entities=new functionality), 1 testSpec.md (CSV import format — test spec didn't require format documentation in import dialog). Added 1 new directive to testSpec.md. All bugs moved to Finished.\n- [x] checkDirectives.md: UnpackCheckDirectives: Checked new/changed code from Round 9\n  - [x] checkDirectives.md: CheckTestSpecNewPages: Checked test spec for Settings, Users, CSV import entries — minor gaps in test coverage for activity section and some modal details (acceptable for new functionality)\n  - [x] checkDirectives.md: CheckComponentsNewPages: Violations found — 6 instances of empty string not converted to null for DATE/UUID columns in CreateDealModal (1), AddDealModal (1), CreateTaskModal (3), EditTaskModal (1)\n  - [x] checkDirectives.md: CheckTestsNewPages: Violations found — 3 uses of `.first()` to resolve ambiguity (STP-WH-04, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01), 2 missing URL assertions (UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01)\n  - [x] checkDirectives.md: FixViolationEmptyStringNull: Fixed 6 empty-string-to-null violations — CreateDealModal (expected_close_date), AddDealModal (expected_close_date), CreateTaskModal (due_date, client_id, deal_id), EditTaskModal (due_date)\n  - [x] checkDirectives.md: FixViolationTestPatterns: Fixed `.first()` usage in STP-WH-04 (target specific webhook item), UDP-DL-01 and UDP-TSK-01 (use user-card- locator instead of parent traversal). Added URL assertions to UDP-DL-01 and UDP-TSK-01.\n  - [x] checkDirectives.md: RunTests: All 209 tests pass\n  - [x] checkDirectives.md: DocumentFix: Documented fixes in plan.md\n- [x] polishApp.md: UnpackPolishApp: Stub — no subtasks\n- [x] deployment.md: UnpackDeployment: Synced production database schema (users, webhooks tables), built, deployed to production at https://sales-crm-1771041441.netlify.app — deployment test passes, Replay recording 1a1874a8-35a7-4bdb-b3a4-8df9d00dd39d confirms data displays and updates work\n- **Maintenance Round 9 COMPLETE**: All 4 bugs fixed (CSV format, CSV all entities, Settings page, Users page), bug reports reviewed, directives checked and fixed, deployed to production\n\n#### Maintenance Round 9 Notes\n\nOpen bug reports to address:\n1. CSV import format documentation needed\n2. CSV import should support deals, contacts, and tasks (not just clients)\n3. Add settings page with import/export and webhook configuration\n4. Add users page with user management and user selection dropdowns\n\n### Maintenance Round 10\n\n- [x] fixBugReport.md: FixBugWebhookDialogInstructions: Added platform-specific setup guides (Zapier, n8n, custom) to webhook modal with step-by-step instructions, URL format hints, and toggleable payload format preview\n- [x] fixBugReport.md: UpdateTestsWebhookDialogInstructions: Added tests for webhook setup guide and payload format toggle\n- [x] fixBugReport.md: UpdateRevisionsWebhookDialogInstructions: Recorded spec change in AppRevisions.md\n- [x] fixBugReport.md: ResolveBugWebhookDialogInstructions: Bug moved to Unreviewed in bugReports.md\n- [x] checkDirectives.md: UnpackCheckDirectives: Unpacked into 34 sub-jobs for systematic compliance check across all pages\n  - [x] checkDirectives.md: FixViolationFilterSelectSearchable: Added `searchable` prop to FilterSelect component — search input with auto-focus, option filtering, \"No matches\" empty state, and search-clear on close. Applied to all FilterSelect instances with large option lists (client, user, deal selects across DealsFilterControls, TasksFilterBar, CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, EditTaskModal, AddTaskModal, AddAttachmentModal).\n\n## Polish\n\n### Responsive UI\n- [ ] ClientsListPage\n- [ ] ClientDetailPage\n- [ ] PersonDetailPage\n- [ ] DealsListPage\n- [ ] DealDetailPage\n- [ ] TasksListPage\n- [x] TaskDetailPage\n- [x] SettingsPage\n- [ ] UsersListPage\n- [ ] UserDetailPage\n\n## Blockers\n\nNone.\n","numLines":411,"startLine":1,"totalLines":411}}}
