See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2.

Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions.

Commands That Frequently Required Multiple Attempts (more than once)\n\n| Command | Multi-Attempts | Total | Multi-Attempt Rate | Common Retry Reasons |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **`npm run test <file>`** | **47** | 76 | **62%** | Most retried command overall. Reasons: missing NEON_PROJECT_ID; retrying with more output lines (tail -5 then tail -10 then tail -20); retrying after npm install; retrying after code fixes; stale dev server processes; Neon API timeouts |\n| **`find`** | **20** | 295 | **7%** | Trying different glob patterns; searching different paths; excluding node_modules; trying different file name conventions (bugReports.md, bug_reports.md, etc.) |\n| **`npm run read-log`** | **11** | 265 | **4%** | Incorrect log file timestamps; retrying with piped output; retrying after npm install |\n| **`ls`** | **11** | 407 | **3%** | Exploring multiple directories in sequence; trying different path patterns |\n| **`npm run deploy`** | **9** | 16 | **56%** | Deploy scripts failing due to locale issues, vite config errors, wrong CLI syntax; each retry with a different fix applied |\n| **`npm run check`** | **7** | 92 | **8%** | Retrying after fixing lint/type errors; verifying from different working directories |\n| **`cat`** | **5** | 115 | **4%** | Parsing test results JSON; reading .env configs; piping to python3/node for JSON extraction |\n| **`grep`** | **5** | 104 | **5%** | Searching test logs with different patterns; searching for tailwind config; broadening search terms |\n| **`npx netlify deploy`** | **5** | 11 | **45%** | Locale workarounds (LC_ALL=C, LC_ALL=C.utf8); adding --no-build flag; fixing import paths |\n| **`npx playwright test --config deployment`** | **5** | 12 | **42%** | Transient failures; retrying after URL corrections; retrying after confirming deployment is live |\n| **`npm install`** | **4** | 19 | **21%** | Retrying from different directories; confirming installation completed |\n| **`curl`** | **4** | 40 | **10%** | Testing after deploy fixes; fixing bash escaping; testing different endpoints |\n| **`npx tsc --noEmit`** | **3** | 22 | **14%** | Retrying after tsconfig modifications; testing different fix approaches (typeRoots, symlinks) |\n| **`git log`** | **3** | 36 | **8%** | Narrowing search scope; trying different -- path filters |\n| **`npx eslint`** | **2** | 4 | **50%** | Running on different files during iterative fixes |\n| **`npx vite build`** | **2** | 6 | **33%** | Retrying after vite config changes (resolve.modules, alias mappings) |\n| **`npx tsx <other>`** | **2** | 6 | **33%** | Testing import resolution in isolation |\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **`npm run test <file>` is by far the most problematic command**: 46% failure rate, 62% multi-attempt rate. The primary causes are missing environment variables (NEON_PROJECT_ID), stale dev server processes, module resolution errors, and flaky Neon API connections.\n\n2. **Deployment commands are highly failure-prone**: `npx netlify deploy` (55% failure rate), `npm run deploy` (31% failure rate), and `npx playwright test --config deployment` (25% failure rate) all struggled with locale issues (missing en_US.UTF-8), import path errors in bundled functions, and transient network problems.\n\n3. **`npx tsx scripts/test.ts` has a 100% failure rate** (3/3) -- it never worked due to module resolution issues with @neondatabase/serverless in the tsx runtime.\n\n4. **Exploration commands are highly reliable**: `ls` (99%), `find` (96%), `git log` (100%), `git diff` (100%), `git show` (100%), `mkdir` (100%), `wc` (100%) all have near-perfect success rates.\n\n5. **Task queueing never fails**: `npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts` has a 100% success rate across all 137 uses with 0% multi-attempt rate.\n\n6. **The total command distribution** shows the majority of work is: file exploration (ls 407 + find 295 = 702, 37%), log reading (npm run read-log 265, 14%), task queueing (add-task 137, 7%), file content reading (cat 115 + grep 104 = 219, 12%), and quality gates (npm run check 92 + npm run test 76 = 168, 9%)."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ab101328b64822381 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 106940\ntool_uses: 5\nduration_ms: 153507</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"732621d0-4984-4975-9d64-748c248b6827","uuid":"7bc80346-2765-44a5-89a0-e84cf0411d54","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Please give me the complete summary data you extracted.

Reasons: missing NEON_PROJECT_ID; retrying with more output lines (tail -5 then tail -10 then tail -20); retrying after npm install; retrying after code fixes; stale dev server processes; Neon API timeouts |\n| **`find`** | **20** | 295 | **7%** | Trying different glob patterns; searching different paths; excluding node_modules; trying different file name conventions (bugReports.md, bug_reports.md, etc.) |\n| **`npm run read-log`** | **11** | 265 | **4%** | Incorrect log file timestamps; retrying with piped output; retrying after npm install |\n| **`ls`** | **11** | 407 | **3%** | Exploring multiple directories in sequence; trying different path patterns |\n| **`npm run deploy`** | **9** | 16 | **56%** | Deploy scripts failing due to locale issues, vite config errors, wrong CLI syntax; each retry with a different fix applied |\n| **`npm run check`** | **7** | 92 | **8%** | Retrying after fixing lint/type errors; verifying from different working directories |\n| **`cat`** | **5** | 115 | **4%** | Parsing test results JSON; reading .env configs; piping to python3/node for JSON extraction |\n| **`grep`** | **5** | 104 | **5%** | Searching test logs with different patterns; searching for tailwind config; broadening search terms |\n| **`npx netlify deploy`** | **5** | 11 | **45%** | Locale workarounds (LC_ALL=C, LC_ALL=C.utf8); adding --no-build flag; fixing import paths |\n| **`npx playwright test --config deployment`** | **5** | 12 | **42%** | Transient failures; retrying after URL corrections; retrying after confirming deployment is live |\n| **`npm install`** | **4** | 19 | **21%** | Retrying from different directories; confirming installation completed |\n| **`curl`** | **4** | 40 | **10%** | Testing after deploy fixes; fixing bash escaping; testing different endpoints |\n| **`npx tsc --noEmit`** | **3** | 22 | **14%** | Retrying after tsconfig modifications; testing different fix approaches (typeRoots, symlinks) |\n| **`git log`** | **3** | 36 | **8%** | Narrowing search scope; trying different -- path filters |\n| **`npx eslint`** | **2** | 4 | **50%** | Running on different files during iterative fixes |\n| **`npx vite build`** | **2** | 6 | **33%** | Retrying after vite config changes (resolve.modules, alias mappings) |\n| **`npx tsx <other>`** | **2** | 6 | **33%** | Testing import resolution in isolation |\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **`npm run test <file>` is by far the most problematic command**: 46% failure rate, 62% multi-attempt rate. The primary causes are missing environment variables (NEON_PROJECT_ID), stale dev server processes, module resolution errors, and flaky Neon API connections.\n\n2. **Deployment commands are highly failure-prone**: `npx netlify deploy` (55% failure rate), `npm run deploy` (31% failure rate), and `npx playwright test --config deployment` (25% failure rate) all struggled with locale issues (missing en_US.UTF-8), import path errors in bundled functions, and transient network problems.\n\n3. **`npx tsx scripts/test.ts` has a 100% failure rate** (3/3) -- it never worked due to module resolution issues with @neondatabase/serverless in the tsx runtime.\n\n4. **Exploration commands are highly reliable**: `ls` (99%), `find` (96%), `git log` (100%), `git diff` (100%), `git show` (100%), `mkdir` (100%), `wc` (100%) all have near-perfect success rates.\n\n5. **Task queueing never fails**: `npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts` has a 100% success rate across all 137 uses with 0% multi-attempt rate.\n\n6. **The total command distribution** shows the majority of work is: file exploration (ls 407 + find 295 = 702, 37%), log reading (npm run read-log 265, 14%), task queueing (add-task 137, 7%), file content reading (cat 115 + grep 104 = 219, 12%), and quality gates (npm run check 92 + npm run test 76 = 168, 9%)."}],"totalDurationMs":153507,"totalTokens":106940,"totalToolUseCount":5,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":86686,"cache_read_input_tokens":15489,"output_tokens":4764,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":86686},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Difficulty Analysis\n\n### Commands That Frequently Required Multiple Attempts\n\n| Command | Multi-Attempts | Total | Rate | Common Retry Reasons |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `npm run test <file>` | 47 | 76 | 62% | Missing NEON_PROJECT_ID env var; stale dev server processes; module resolution errors; retrying with more output lines; retrying after npm install or code fixes |\n| `npm run deploy` | 9 | 16 | 56% | Locale issues (LC_ALL not set / en_US.UTF-8 missing); vite config errors; wrong CLI syntax |\n| `npx eslint` | 2 | 4 | 50% | Running on different files during iterative fixes |\n| `npx netlify deploy` | 5 | 11 | 45% | Locale workarounds (LC_ALL=C, LC_ALL=C.utf8); adding --no-build flag; fixing import paths |\n| `npx playwright test --config deployment` | 5 | 12 | 42% | Transient failures; URL corrections; waiting for deployment to go live |\n| `npx vite build` | 2 | 6 | 33% | Retrying after vite config changes (resolve.modules, alias mappings) |\n| `npx tsx <other>` | 2 | 6 | 33% | Testing import resolution in isolation |\n| `npm install` | 4 | 19 | 21% | Retrying from different directories; confirming installation completed |\n\n### Commands That Frequently Failed\n\n| Command | Failures | Total | Failure Rate | Common Failure Reasons |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `npx tsx scripts/test.ts` | 3 | 3 | 100% | Module resolution failure for @neondatabase/serverless in tsx runtime — never succeeded |\n| `npx netlify deploy` | 6 | 11 | 55% | Locale errors (LC_ALL not set); import path errors in bundled functions |\n| `npx tsx scripts/schema.ts` | 2 | 4 | 50% | Module resolution failure for @neondatabase/serverless |\n| `npm run test <file>` | 35 | 76 | 46% | Missing NEON_PROJECT_ID; stale dev server; module resolution errors; Neon API timeouts; test assertion failures |\n| `npx vite build` | 2 | 6 | 33% | Missing path aliases for shared dependencies; invalid resolve.modules config |\n| `npm run deploy` | 5 | 16 | 31% | Locale issues; vite build config errors; incorrect `netlify env:set` syntax |\n| `npx playwright test --config deployment` | 3 | 12 | 25% | Transient network issues; deployment not yet live; wrong deployment URL |\n| `npx tsc --noEmit` | 4 | 22 | 18% | Pre-existing type errors; module resolution issues with @neondatabase/serverless |\n\n### Patterns in What Made Commands Difficult\n\n1. **Environment variable issues**: The most pervasive problem. `NEON_PROJECT_ID` was frequently missing from the test environment, causing widespread test failures. The agent often had to discover this through trial and error.\n\n2. **Locale configuration**: Netlify CLI commands (`npx netlify deploy`, `npm run deploy`) repeatedly failed because the container lacked `en_US.UTF-8` locale. The agent developed workarounds (`LC_ALL=C`, `LC_ALL=C.utf8`) but these were rediscovered in multiple sessions.\n\n3. **Module resolution for @neondatabase/serverless**: Commands using `tsx` runtime (`npx tsx scripts/test.ts`, `npx tsx scripts/schema.ts`) consistently failed because tsx couldn't resolve this dependency. This was never resolved.\n\n4. **Stale dev server processes**: Test commands failed when previous `netlify dev` or `vite` processes were still running, requiring `pkill` to clean up.\n\n5. **Iterative output expansion**: The agent frequently ran test commands, saw truncated output, then retried with `| tail -10`, `| tail -20`, etc. to see more of the failure output.\n\n### Agent Workarounds That Succeeded\n\n- **Locale fix**: `LC_ALL=C npx netlify deploy` or `LC_ALL=C.utf8 npx netlify deploy` worked around missing locale\n- **Process cleanup**: `pkill -f \"netlify dev\"` before running tests resolved stale server issues\n- **Direct npm install**: Running `npm install @neondatabase/serverless` in app directories fixed missing dependency issues\n- **Piped output**: Using `2>&1 | tail -N` to capture and expand error output for diagnosis\n- **Alternative quality gate**: Using `npx tsc --noEmit` instead of `npm run check` for faster targeted type checking\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\n### `skills/scripts/*.md` — Script Updates\n\n1. **Create `skills/scripts/test.md`**: Document the standard test procedure, including:\n   - Required environment variables (NEON_PROJECT_ID, database connection strings) and how to verify they are set before running tests\n   - How to kill stale dev server processes before running tests (`pkill -f \"netlify dev\"`)\n   - Recommended output capture pattern (`2>&1 | tail -50` rather than iteratively expanding from -5 to -10 to -20)\n   - Note that `npx tsx scripts/test.ts` does not work and should not be used; use `npm run test` instead\n\n2. **Update `skills/scripts/check.md`** (if exists) or create it:\n   - Document that `npm run check` runs both tsc and eslint\n   - Recommend `npx tsc --noEmit` for faster type-only checks during iterative development\n   - Document common fix patterns for type errors (especially @neondatabase/serverless resolution)\n\n3. **Create `skills/scripts/deploy.md`**: Document the deployment procedure, including:\n   - The locale workaround: always prefix Netlify CLI commands with `LC_ALL=C` or ensure locale is configured at container startup\n   - When to use `npm run deploy` vs `npx netlify deploy --prod`\n   - How to verify deployment with `curl` before running deployment tests\n   - Standard `npx playwright test --config deployment` verification procedure\n\n4. **Create `skills/scripts/env-setup.md`**: Document environment prerequisites:\n   - Required environment variables per app (NEON_PROJECT_ID, DATABASE_URL, etc.)\n   - How to verify `.env` files exist and contain required values\n   - Locale configuration requirements for Netlify CLI\n\n### Task Skill Improvements\n\n5. **Testing task skills** should include a pre-flight check step:\n   - Verify NEON_PROJECT_ID is set: `echo $NEON_PROJECT_ID`\n   - Kill stale servers: `pkill -f \"netlify dev\" 2>/dev/null; pkill -f \"vite\" 2>/dev/null`\n   - Verify node_modules: `ls node_modules/@neondatabase/serverless 2>/dev/null || npm install`\n\n6. **Deployment task skills** should include the locale fix as a standard preamble and not require the agent to rediscover it each time.\n\n### Standard Procedures to Document\n\n7. **File exploration should prefer structured tools**: The agent ran 407 `ls` and 295 `find` commands (37% of all commands). Many of these were exploratory. Skills should specify expected directory structures so the agent doesn't need to explore from scratch each time.\n\n8. **Log reading is efficient**: `npm run read-log` (265 uses, 97% success) is well-designed and reliable. No changes needed.\n\n9. **Task queueing is perfect**: `npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts` (137 uses, 100% success, 0% retries) is the most reliable command in the system. No changes needed.\n\n10. **Address the @neondatabase/serverless tsx resolution issue**: Since `npx tsx scripts/test.ts` and `npx tsx scripts/schema.ts` both fail on this, either fix the tsx configuration (add a `tsconfig` paths mapping or install the dependency globally) or document that these scripts must be run through a different mechanism.\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5153,"cache_read_input_tokens":34131,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5153,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"732621d0-4984-4975-9d64-748c248b6827","uuid":"8e998eed-8e71-4f74-a9c0-1eb33f56a9e1"}

Difficulty Analysis\n\n### Commands That Frequently Required Multiple Attempts\n\n| Command | Multi-Attempts | Total | Rate | Common Retry Reasons |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `npm run test <file>` | 47 | 76 | 62% | Missing NEON_PROJECT_ID env var; stale dev server processes; module resolution errors; retrying with more output lines; retrying after npm install or code fixes |\n| `npm run deploy` | 9 | 16 | 56% | Locale issues (LC_ALL not set / en_US.UTF-8 missing); vite config errors; wrong CLI syntax |\n| `npx eslint` | 2 | 4 | 50% | Running on different files during iterative fixes |\n| `npx netlify deploy` | 5 | 11 | 45% | Locale workarounds (LC_ALL=C, LC_ALL=C.utf8); adding --no-build flag; fixing import paths |\n| `npx playwright test --config deployment` | 5 | 12 | 42% | Transient failures; URL corrections; waiting for deployment to go live |\n| `npx vite build` | 2 | 6 | 33% | Retrying after vite config changes (resolve.modules, alias mappings) |\n| `npx tsx <other>` | 2 | 6 | 33% | Testing import resolution in isolation |\n| `npm install` | 4 | 19 | 21% | Retrying from different directories; confirming installation completed |\n\n### Commands That Frequently Failed\n\n| Command | Failures | Total | Failure Rate | Common Failure Reasons |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| `npx tsx scripts/test.ts` | 3 | 3 | 100% | Module resolution failure for @neondatabase/serverless in tsx runtime — never succeeded |\n| `npx netlify deploy` | 6 | 11 | 55% | Locale errors (LC_ALL not set); import path errors in bundled functions |\n| `npx tsx scripts/schema.ts` | 2 | 4 | 50% | Module resolution failure for @neondatabase/serverless |\n| `npm run test <file>` | 35 | 76 | 46% | Missing NEON_PROJECT_ID; stale dev server; module resolution errors; Neon API timeouts; test assertion failures |\n| `npx vite build` | 2 | 6 | 33% | Missing path aliases for shared dependencies; invalid resolve.modules config |\n| `npm run deploy` | 5 | 16 | 31% | Locale issues; vite build config errors; incorrect `netlify env:set` syntax |\n| `npx playwright test --config deployment` | 3 | 12 | 25% | Transient network issues; deployment not yet live; wrong deployment URL |\n| `npx tsc --noEmit` | 4 | 22 | 18% | Pre-existing type errors; module resolution issues with @neondatabase/serverless |\n\n### Patterns in What Made Commands Difficult\n\n1. **Environment variable issues**: The most pervasive problem. `NEON_PROJECT_ID` was frequently missing from the test environment, causing widespread test failures. The agent often had to discover this through trial and error.\n\n2. **Locale configuration**: Netlify CLI commands (`npx netlify deploy`, `npm run deploy`) repeatedly failed because the container lacked `en_US.UTF-8` locale. The agent developed workarounds (`LC_ALL=C`, `LC_ALL=C.utf8`) but these were rediscovered in multiple sessions.\n\n3. **Module resolution for @neondatabase/serverless**: Commands using `tsx` runtime (`npx tsx scripts/test.ts`, `npx tsx scripts/schema.ts`) consistently failed because tsx couldn't resolve this dependency. This was never resolved.\n\n4. **Stale dev server processes**: Test commands failed when previous `netlify dev` or `vite` processes were still running, requiring `pkill` to clean up.\n\n5. **Iterative output expansion**: The agent frequently ran test commands, saw truncated output, then retried with `| tail -10`, `| tail -20`, etc. to see more of the failure output.\n\n### Agent Workarounds That Succeeded\n\n- **Locale fix**: `LC_ALL=C npx netlify deploy` or `LC_ALL=C.utf8 npx netlify deploy` worked around missing locale\n- **Process cleanup**: `pkill -f \"netlify dev\"` before running tests resolved stale server issues\n- **Direct npm install**: Running `npm install @neondatabase/serverless` in app directories fixed missing dependency issues\n- **Piped output**: Using `2>&1 | tail -N` to capture and expand error output for diagnosis\n- **Alternative quality gate**: Using `npx tsc --noEmit` instead of `npm run check` for faster targeted type checking\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\n### `skills/scripts/*.md` — Script Updates\n\n1. **Create `skills/scripts/test.md`**: Document the standard test procedure, including:\n   - Required environment variables (NEON_PROJECT_ID, database connection strings) and how to verify they are set before running tests\n   - How to kill stale dev server processes before running tests (`pkill -f \"netlify dev\"`)\n   - Recommended output capture pattern (`2>&1 | tail -50` rather than iteratively expanding from -5 to -10 to -20)\n   - Note that `npx tsx scripts/test.ts` does not work and should not be used; use `npm run test` instead\n\n2. **Update `skills/scripts/check.md`** (if exists) or create it:\n   - Document that `npm run check` runs both tsc and eslint\n   - Recommend `npx tsc --noEmit` for faster type-only checks during iterative development\n   - Document common fix patterns for type errors (especially @neondatabase/serverless resolution)\n\n3. **Create `skills/scripts/deploy.md`**: Document the deployment procedure, including:\n   - The locale workaround: always prefix Netlify CLI commands with `LC_ALL=C` or ensure locale is configured at container startup\n   - When to use `npm run deploy` vs `npx netlify deploy --prod`\n   - How to verify deployment with `curl` before running deployment tests\n   - Standard `npx playwright test --config deployment` verification procedure\n\n4. **Create `skills/scripts/env-setup.md`**: Document environment prerequisites:\n   - Required environment variables per app (NEON_PROJECT_ID, DATABASE_URL, etc.)\n   - How to verify `.env` files exist and contain required values\n   - Locale configuration requirements for Netlify CLI\n\n### Task Skill Improvements\n\n5. **Testing task skills** should include a pre-flight check step:\n   - Verify NEON_PROJECT_ID is set: `echo $NEON_PROJECT_ID`\n   - Kill stale servers: `pkill -f \"netlify dev\" 2>/dev/null; pkill -f \"vite\" 2>/dev/null`\n   - Verify node_modules: `ls node_modules/@neondatabase/serverless 2>/dev/null || npm install`\n\n6. **Deployment task skills** should include the locale fix as a standard preamble and not require the agent to rediscover it each time.\n\n### Standard Procedures to Document\n\n7. **File exploration should prefer structured tools**: The agent ran 407 `ls` and 295 `find` commands (37% of all commands). Many of these were exploratory. Skills should specify expected directory structures so the agent doesn't need to explore from scratch each time.\n\n8. **Log reading is efficient**: `npm run read-log` (265 uses, 97% success) is well-designed and reliable. No changes needed.\n\n9. **Task queueing is perfect**: `npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts` (137 uses, 100% success, 0% retries) is the most reliable command in the system. No changes needed.\n\n10. **Address the @neondatabase/serverless tsx resolution issue**: Since `npx tsx scripts/test.ts` and `npx tsx scripts/schema.ts` both fail on this, either fix the tsx configuration (add a `tsconfig` paths mapping or install the dependency globally) or document that these scripts must be run through a different mechanism.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
