Let me write the analysis files for all 10 logs. Let me summarize what I found in each log:\n\n**Log 3** (worker-app-building-eghui7-3): ReviewBugReport task - Unpack review fixed bug reports. The agent used several shell commands: `ls`, `git log`, `git show`, `cat`, `curl`. No bug reports were found so the task was simple.\n\n**Log 30** (worker-app-building-eghui7-30): CheckDirectives task for MaterialsPage (InventoryTracker). Hit API Error 500 almost immediately after reading 2 files. \n\n**Logs 31-33** show the same CheckDirectives task for AccountDetailPage failing repeatedly with API Error 500 across three retry attempts, with the task getting progressively further before hitting the error each time.\n\n**Logs 34-36** follow a similar pattern for AccountsPage, where the CheckDirectives task also fails three times with API Error 500, hitting the error earlier in each subsequent attempt until it fails immediately on the final retry.\n\n**Logs 37-38** show the same issue repeating for DashboardPage, with the CheckDirectives task encountering API Error 500 on the first retry and again on the second retry after doing some file reading and grepping.\n\nNow I'm moving into the analysis phase, writing out the shell commands found across all the logs to the analysis directory.\n\nLooking through the logs, Log 3 had several shell commands including directory checks, git log viewing, commit details, and task file reading. Logs 30, 31, and 32 didn't execute any shell commands before hitting API errors or only using read and glob tools.\n\nNow in Log 33, I'm running commands to list the apps directory, read task files, and download a mockup image from a URL. Log 34 appears to be starting similar commands to list apps and read task files again, but the thinking cuts off mid-command.\n\nLooking at Logs 35-38, I'm hitting API errors increasingly early—first after reading just 2 files, then immediately, then after only using glob, grep, and read tools. Now I'm moving on to write the analysis
