Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it.

Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a58d6e82-8d38-4fab-848f-3ed5e19c12ec","uuid":"ce4d6017-c39e-4a3a-8334-3f6dd40b14a2","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Contains the UserDetailPage\n5. **SupplierTracker**\n6. **shared** - Shared components\n\n---\n\n## SalesCRM App - User Detail Page\n\n### File Locations\n\n**Main Page Component:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/UserDetailPage.tsx`\n\n**Sub-Components:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/UserHeader.tsx` - Displays user name, email, join date, avatar\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/UserStats.tsx` - Shows active deals, open tasks, total deals counts\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/OwnedDealsList.tsx` - Lists deals owned by the user\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/AssignedTasksList.tsx` - Lists tasks assigned to the user\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/RecentActivityFeed.tsx` - Shows user's recent activity\n\n**State Management:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/userDetailSlice.ts` - Redux slice for user detail data\n\n**Test Specification:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` - Lines 2278-2472 contain complete test specs for UserDetailPage\n\n### Playwright Configuration\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/playwright.config.ts`\n\n**Key Settings:**\n- Tests directory: `./tests`\n- Test timeout: 60000ms (60 seconds)\n- Expect timeout: 15000ms (15 seconds)\n- Action timeout: 15000ms\n- Navigation timeout: 30000ms\n- Uses Replay.io for recording\n- Base URL: `http://localhost:8888`\n- Starts Netlify dev server automatically\n- Runs in test mode with `IS_TEST=true` environment variable\n- Configured to run in parallel\n- CI environment uses 2 retries\n\n### Existing Test Files for Reference\n\n**Tests to understand conventions:**\n\n1. **Sidebar Navigation Tests** - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/sidebar.spec.ts` (400+ lines)\n   - Pattern: Uses `page.goto()`, `expect()`, `getByTestId()`, `toBeVisible()`, `toHaveURL()`, `toHaveClass()`\n   - Uses `test.slow()` for slow tests\n   -

I'll navigate to the users list, select a user, and verify the displayed data matches what's expected, which handles both the populated and empty state scenarios without relying on fixed counts or IDs.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3771,"cache_read_input_tokens":44996,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3771,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a58d6e82-8d38-4fab-848f-3ed5e19c12ec","uuid":"1bb54e24-0599-408a-82be-e6a7c9b576ea"}

For empty deal states, I can pick from Grace, Henry, or Irene. For empty task states, I need to find someone without any tasks assigned, but looking at the data, everyone who appears has at least one task.\n\nActually, Irene Davis is perfect across the board—she has zero deals, zero tasks, and zero activity, so she's my go-to for all empty state tests.\n\nFor the actual test approach, I'll navigate to the users list first to discover user IDs dynamically rather than hardcoding them, then click through to individual user detail pages to verify the data displays correctly. I need to follow the test guidelines about not hardcoding IDs, so I'll query the API to fetch the user list, find the one matching the name I need, and navigate directly to their detail page using the discovered ID.","signature":"EqsvCkYICxgCKkBdi67EN80HtvC/9zj3pSc+3kCWm6OtpHlu2I1xPtJcbEi2o3as6M8Q7MwYqNdZjCt4byKQiVVd/xVOIFw+iLwxEgxDNzlLglFxG981uMkaDGpI8U9byBzpQzhehSIwVBdqO5QUgsr3l9wzDKjzVUgucAEuKVR011F2RFTH8UfEcXlxedEpeUdCE4I/kMzKKpIuizN88imyFKNb6yZyf9Mog3wVLwWjSnxpS9Il8BbpJw+PuRl+pVeeIBpWjE/0C63SCNrJnx1sX/+chIsvmnrFjxAwxVOuEsU/u7M/qIBJrwnpq9bnMEJwE/0xwqqFjrqDy06ATKN8A+LP+o6h4KkL4Icwf0jwIwB8UJSEwCxHSdmUYO3ENhrDzgIsAO2NwQfhC2wgBg3b1+2dfSkC3W0EVKtOY92faHvIWDb/KNClymOsD+22Usq74zzzR19UU7gsg4eIWgeevET1bv6FEcY5oyOfO37hzZk0ctYWiCQICpk4Y5a+0HwGdQ6+saSwb5gUbdMQn3CtyDhAM2/GZj3efvksG0MrrsEiJrxfK4S5E7XwPY2zPkhUCajNwwjHjWjZJNzc6JH9jwIQG3On+W5ZSMB7gAaR4xI/tEn3Cbo2RBSra3Z/RkNHKkFl47TOOA96UtNCjRavbrQGhd4HoSPXqqPTYO5wRdpDMt0DeoG5MHobsNq8fUMZ5cYEXo6R+OHNg1iWdWyynUWQ66SkYUFrqJO+Aw1BYBnvwdVNqa/AiWhG0nuPO4Be9KSFTGv7Giz+ZwUqQZ2wWtkeuO4xok6TkVdKF6sz8b3Qt3BBEfgNDJxW4NDHFzu/EOnWL0PYtaO/bYoc2Zp+2tNBqxysGLcMrxJ5SUEzTorWIy9pGfUf1t3+w3keSvwoEMwB9nhDxarWfPwaJgEpcnd098KwTzd9h5Qk/ngM22ztoUmZoKoOKCh9yOW6qgH0Xr3QvVlWE8OjN4YxrTBHacpEXvTbPIjbmSADTbPzmjVmkq5jlanBLtcAReJGtfiZLrlxMVsK8lHk8oUVEDRflhDQaUmbTK8JT6z+vs7Y6b/jiPtqCLQx2hQ398Nkee0uZcKNxeQwk/dg1Dz7rO6i37EgoK5UYLKftbR/dfBHraNlPi+zd8JE+NYPuo3IqA9ZV1qAC0KWUOC4SIZdJP7346fgtQct18d1kg6rJB0fzq+uZyZM8mLubZRSXNVPJiPUKrViZA9p0Anhto8/jDvWb+Mw8nnbuWA1ZhvThneY4QrkcuQgX/IbmOkVIneSrkfke05juObf2iodwIWtUQOYIdsMsi/6FD39vNLDhda+s+0AwDXSaQ61Pyty+kXxrYkcX+HJimotanJ1gI6AjkOjfelZHPf1MBlXreodENbFOcuJ46Mb2+gE3y+5OqfBxp0Dj6qLo8x9GBPiQIbNF44bZVTYMZ5iQMqv5ihC4XFfYlSyQi80zyBUVTaFx0iwgFmmlAgosPi1pQM5jH2Ad7zgEaM88EcdS5kwSqnBTD7yDq5QF5rTqvg81zXh2FiqSU1JfdhfIimEVE+mt59yTL0YUtkwARrbL/5ewXFb3KBzQXTJDxGPM63VhdRUtWVaW/wCbDHqamUaTlLEVe3L9MgVRwDevFMVJwGun6dvfx1lxTeVPP3gNa5MRioBd3m2XEuF/qdDZEkA/UJoZNU3ot68Rpgt4/qit6IuLSn31flkveJaKPot9jqo3tvGvAOyPg0h0ceWHT8bbX0gN9F8/m0DCTtr2LI5YFDjl2gdIr7pivD4s/g0xragd/Y1A80wDYXvRFIKaB7PKclE8NJkeOQGWr6wzQxSDVjfKeu1vOmRWBNJdomxoDHr6bjJB7S872On8vgVO1SinnkiUXQK3706aAM2DkaVveBEX//MQ4RDrhlPKaoPHDdrChff0ugBgRVlJvy+w3v/zYXlqvhHPstkkhaqDBGL+yV+wzZL/WXGP/tBO4jbtkjz8PDkRM37xecqNv3nRMGUpxS81cgfHsP88IUlES4/pBVZZIUcoYqTiTDbLvg2sTQOxJ4oFHGn1mRVE3UkC6Il9Th5VanzYKBAnotF+FbSSzOa+9r9Ofoq60/S/NATLvOhdxJKO7iOJ2OffRUc3uvI/jYVJl6nJYFnjKLZ75wyJ43Kl8yVT6GoLytwP623mA7amDDcTqU3L9754adOSUhxQBH/FREO7LRpbSoxuwyxR/0JjZzuVVk3lnZqarG5GteprbRN0PKwtBWgFR7D2XEH5UTG2ceF02b7bUn5NFdTBq8HHuIiA2G+YiVaAdEqzKsKdRmM2Qig13QYlYouCG71wmxYWsf4ZJnT3dgoB7AkNkOilcxc1odaNt53nQWJ7RIFOC8SHv2ldpZGMIK5Lr7wPZenKxe/RnB53wRA01HncxmUo88vs1+5l2aGVt28Vf3VJdPc3G8QvrqU5CiYfvqgrQFFDWeDaP1Qt94pDEp3tkePAn9Rwx9QGnzcIchSe50dCWGcWJzUTH1DVS0yTrUTVy/l/f43G0oeq2UmGToum6D4ztFleDwlkBehUWsdtMaAyId1rKLQEsnJ13a/YxXQV+4mLr92W92jSca6hG7uqBxmaTGjkYwvyLCAzb3TDif8vMYNxoDyGcln6waJXXHCoq734E08N5ieCkaAVZBbTipLJVUWF1ffkb8kiVtMLMH05e3kC27BrURAIoa6RNKe4tG8a2xilcNS3CjcKP/xwFtoDcL6AeK7+jbt/AC+VR2GgaSOSuI95eC6IYP8G6nFey3VnOHjEb11k0hKCfT1xNOVz0SIV7ER8Ln9EUHcHy8ucZuctj+rqsJtxYHYP8YyutVHQ5Wu0Xb5Q5kQbe4lHrxqn3JwB+Fg2qYN5q/bnRCtIvaYkMyXErk/r8mRQlZta64shFLxKD3P8FVAFtygXBNrq7Rluzsx8v6w3O7EXCpbf8Vs2QaHHnVubqOqwiWniIlIFcr/JqqttmA6QyqkYQXOo+uToKnfIer3SVZ8/Z54OIasHS3ovEQY4YuqhgWUyUFKzwi9GQ7xp9fj10motAOa3A+98Ge+tClnDI1/NGRm9yPWGlT06C22OD8azAYny/+tGVGcO9LkbuMbuK413J0zLskEA0qVkuU/AJPK0Jt5DZWeStRCIWWolgZdoVmhLWoCMqfugB0gfE2ZljgQomo+QhyaEmtkGqPFowHCZ7eII/BaDyrW4T61zm+SK3g5R5JZ4ZFx/4x/QVYmtH/Kt6ph1JDeZxi/ohZ68fodmmhhmbM8HA/XPXEkT28O41rp+rTiqtrnQPj11DWG2iNoX1GUfKKuV03GmUmNpJ3J5XGHDOXVWvZ+v7InGTQSnnKQxuRbY9opnxezsC+dtZaKYGFOESEYLxPj87h8EHiuvBJWKYHfRLpQSpjWLXzszJQGDRVRV/kYFRfv0EcSUVSZzdlpNbnBimrF2WxXUFWbdIf7Dga0ErzysdAcHJlLYqnoLONmzmSue9M4n8APUS0iRv3i4y07+JpDsmsWMBTvDgn7aJv3C9E85/Vdr0A1YKL3PWQ86sn/Bkb4dN/QybKpBuYIX1fl4R4BD/gejjDG8jQotAdiy3BHDtw4zjpkwvaDiyKUAYov1+e7vhvoGrnXGlzTHbLxasa6lsXwveXZTPNyJqgVYZ8pxCr2SQXNaVFST+2Q/GafowM/nXRcmihfApQKb5nSMf5qjx/7tnD1a2DpFMFpxZXjM87hBrMcM/MjoYvqBCL1YmD+dbyJvraRe9Q4poGeyrBWSdDeuR+rvoSrbD2gMdnhKIUAJUbmtIZIzOnodx+w7CSu1gOVqitG0+EUSH8xoZ1YNqAV5AQ1IuaJBPcw4B0WRYl4dk+nwX9moX3y8BkIagWTAaRPM/X/YCBa8+TC4sb+fe290s9bh3QEsgx5MOoNKKrxyPTaNDme3gt5khHCOxmODHYO6glMGWnLD5f/ifot5ImSlNnTV1IAmQggFPbc6PysasU4P9jB/dkzHoNyDHbUjYd8Q22vlY6n3w3xQMSkxQgiKeapU7iEPJ1bR5XzItjbS/NdQMP5BF+a6C0OXT6UCb+4XNQoBxvSp2ICRJeNiS6PDDhnRPsmCgsAoY6m3uuerBv5WMf3tdEfl0rtLlbg54lPPn+p4EAWOQl6wGKn855RVrof3HTg88hZZPMtGQO1RHpEE3Arx5HOUNehbjgFb83OZQ5qff7jff2o+gbtR9ls0i7Ihp5Mc3vX9B122iA9Fv6fiWZCdIE7W793MVCRsqsLspHdprbhsulicCfPZ82CWrTTyWyQJFs4RyvmWc7CjquqVAItf//J8Xj9EIDaApqMHNV6yKCPsNPy5pat4OMShXtEJv8gMelUSIuKPhd2hqRQOvN5lPwA6dofXD46E5Ry1+WcoAvWUp6jEwY4b43rRXF3iypq0Id74gCOFaD1/pzq5x2Y/PeChz7ECedehYYfUNcqWrGoVbG3UaW2MSmiTPZSR0znDb5UtnG7PmuBB8jioF8k8V7WYtDv11iJZhGO6WpcuQZxN18D4lFrEcEzXGx2QGAqFECDfBcZN5f0qWGm4RAgEbJq3Sqp+gt/aYGJTd8enKY7zJGqa/XAvAcYqitLse5zDyEJLjfmlCYzGQ2jRW80znJjnntSReYzuoEiE1LvXTaZ44XIXKl/2AMxz5OpgjwmF+L+7ANaXHdQikXl9Plhe10FS8fymHMtb57ytMQt46NMdsvHysBZXSZzHx+jqXkG1h2+0B4+sdHOv8aqjUeRuzI+tEB2+SLtnENdvCFP1ICg9eV7QRmuJMTpoBs9mwfg2MKv16+cmm8B/f5oVH8gBFa13wkdzO7LN1WvC6bNEA454qBk3IBylNDMoC05YPu/Q0D3SwCRAnF873IFg+v7I7XyazgdIPBelk4XWLCGMTRQxnmgMmvJSNK8YQ1WFCYJRp41Yu3zLq6LqIpXB96AqBCeALo1OL2P3hchqJqN4mVGLW4o9Mtcsm2+CoJimP

Let me also check if there's a DealDetailPage and TaskDetailPage - these are needed for navigation tests.\n\nActually, I should check the route definitions to understand the URL patterns for deals and tasks detail pages.\n\nLet me also check if there are existing spec files that might use the same `data-testid` values I need.\n\nI think I have enough information. Let me write the test file now.\n\nLet me plan all 36 tests:\n\n### Test Structure\n\nI'll organize them into test.describe blocks matching the component groupings.\n\nFor each test, the approach will be:\n1. Use API to discover user IDs dynamically\n\n\n2. Navigate to the user detail page\n3. Assert on the expected behavior\n\nI'm reviewing the seed data I'll use for these tests - Alice Johnson is my primary test user since she has a good mix of deals, tasks, and activity history that covers most of the scenarios I need to validate.\n\nNow I'm setting up the test file with a helper function to fetch user data from the API, and I'm mapping out the specific activity events I'll need to verify for Alice's timeline, including the deal creation and stage transitions. Writing the query logic...\n\nSo I'm getting 7 timeline events created by Alice and 7 deal history entries across her two deals, totaling 14 activity records. Now I need to categorize these for the activity tests—deal-related actions cover the deal creation and stage changes, task-related actions are the task creations, and I'm still figuring out what qualifies as client-related actions.\n\nLooking at the seed data more carefully, I notice that the client-related events like client_created and contact_added are all attributed to 'System' rather than Alice Johnson. This means Alice doesn't actually have any client-related activity entries in the current dataset, which could be a problem for testing that specific scenario about adding notes to clients. I'm realizing the test expects client-related activity entries, but the seed data only has system-generated client events with no user actions. I need to either add the missing seed data or implement the functionality to track when users add notes to clients so these activities can be recorded and tested. The activity feed only pulls from `timeline_events` and `deal_history`, so contact history won't show up there. Looking at the test requirements, Alice has the deal and task events covered, but there are no client-related events in the seed data for any user. I need to either add client-related timeline events to the seed data or adjust the test expectations accordingly. to a user\n2. Create data in a test setup\n3. Use the API to create such events in the test\n\nI think the simplest approach is to add a timeline event in the seed data that attributes a client-related action to a user, like Alice.\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. I could also just check that when a user has client-related activity, it shows up. If the seed data doesn't have it, I might need to modify seed data or use API calls to create data.\n\nBut actually, I should just write the test in a way that works with existing data. For the \"Activity entries include client-related actions\" test, the easiest approach is:\n1. Navigate to a user with client-related activity in their feed\n2. If no user has it, add some seed data\n\nLet me add a few more timeline events to the seed that are client-related and attributed to a user. Actually wait - I need to be careful about the constraints here. The instructions say I shouldn't add features or refactor beyond what's asked, but I also need to finish implementing incomplete parts of the app. So the real question is whether the test itself can create the necessary data rather than relying on seed data, or if I should skip the test when that data isn't available. I'm weighing whether to modify the seed data directly or create test data within the test itself. Option A feels cleanest since I just need one timeline event for Alice in the database, but I'm concerned about unintended side effects on other tests. Let me go with creating the event in a beforeAll hook instead—that way the test is self-contained and won't risk breaking anything else. I need to verify that the icon mapping logic works correctly for all the event types in the tests. The `getEventIcon` function checks the event type string and returns the appropriate icon category, and the `ActivityIcon` component uses similar logic to render the correct SVG. For the test cases involving deals, tasks, and clients, I need to make sure the event types I'm using in the seed data will match these conditions properly.\n\nLooking at Alice's current activity, I have deal-related events like `deal_created` and `deal_stage_changed`, plus `task_created`, but there's no event with \"client\" in the type. I'll need to add a client-related event to the seed data to make that test pass.\n\nNow I'm checking the ordering logic - the query uses `ORDER BY created_at DESC`, but since timeline events are inserted without explicit timestamps, they might all have the same created_at value, making their order non-deterministic. The deal history entries have explicit timestamps though, so I can rely on those for testing reverse chronological ordering. I'll structure the test to verify that activities with different timestamps appear in the correct order.\n\nWriting the test file... I'm setting up the test data structure with specific user profiles—Alice Johnson has two active deals and two open tasks, while Irene Davis is another test user I'm defining. I'll use the API to fetch user IDs and navigate directly to each user's detail page, waiting for it to fully load before running assertions. I'm adding a client_note_added event to the seed data so Alice will have an activity that triggers the client icon, since the getEventIcon function checks for \"client\" in the event type before checking for other keywords. Now I need to verify the reverse chronological ordering test by checking that the most recent activity appears first. timestamp. The timeline events will show up first since they're all more recent, followed by the deal history entries in reverse chronological order. I need to verify the ordering by checking how the timestamps are formatted—relative times like \"X minutes ago\" for recent events, or formatted dates for older ones.\n\nFor the test, I'll keep it straightforward: verify that activity items exist and are displayed with timestamps, checking that the sequence makes sense by comparing a recent entry against an older one from the API response.\n\nNow I'm noticing a discrepancy in the test spec—Alice's data shows 2 open tasks, but the requirement expects 4, so I need to figure out which number is actually correct for the test assertion.\n\nI'll verify the stats match whatever the API actually returns for each user, and I'll use Irene Davis (who has zero deals and tasks) for the empty state test. Before writing the tests, I should add a client-related timeline event to Alice's seed data to support that test case, then create the test file following the existing naming convention.\n\nFor the navigation tests, I need to verify that clicking a deal or task entry changes the URL to the correct pattern and displays the corresponding detail page.\n\nWriting the test file... I'm organizing the remaining test groups for OwnedDealsList, AssignedTasksList, and handling empty states—making sure each component's display logic, navigation behavior, and edge cases are covered across the 36 total tests.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the test implementation strategy: I'll minimize redundant navigation by letting tests within the same describe block run independently, and for the client-related activity test, I'll seed that data upfront rather than creating it dynamically during the test.\n\nSetting up the test file... Writing test cases... Writing test cases... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases...\n\nI'm realizing there are some gaps in my test strategy. The chronological ordering test needs to pull actual activity data from the API to properly verify the sequence. The client-related actions test is blocked without modifying the seed data, and the multiple entries test should have a more robust assertion than just counting elements.\n\nLet me refactor: I'll fetch the user's activity directly from the API to establish the expected order, then navigate to the page and confirm the displayed entries match that sequence. For the client actions test, I need to add a seed entry that includes a client-related event. And I'll set a specific threshold for the multiple entries test rather than just checking that items exist.\n\nActually, thinking about this more carefully—the API already returns activity sorted by creation date in descending order, so the component is just rendering what it receives. I can verify the ordering by checking that specific activity descriptions appear in their expected positions on the page. Since Alice's activity history includes both recent timeline events and older deal records with known timestamps, I can use those to validate the display order. I'm seeing the deal history entries continue with stage changes for the first deal, and there's a pattern emerging where the timeline events and deal history are describing the same transitions but with slightly different wording—the timeline uses \"moved from X to Y\" while the history uses \"Changed deal stage from 'X' to 'Y'\". I'm realizing the ordering gets tricky when timeline events share the same created_at timestamp from a batch insert—the ORDER BY might not be deterministic. The deal history entries have explicit timestamps though, so those will sort consistently. For testing purposes, I'll simplify and just verify the basic ordering works rather than worrying about edge cases with identical timestamps. I'll verify the activity order by fetching the API data and checking that items on the page match the sorted response. Now I need to write out the full test file and handle the client-related actions test too. I'm planning to add a timeline event to the seed data to support this—specifically a client note entry with the relevant timestamps and user information.\n\nFor the order test, Alice will have 8 timeline events plus 7 deal history entries, totaling 15 activity items within the 20-item limit. I should double-check that the event description matches what the test expects—something like \"Added note on client 'Acme Corp'\"—and verify that the icon logic correctly identifies this as a client-related action.\n\nFinishing the seed modification...\n\nNow I'm checking the database query to make sure Alice's new entry gets picked up. The query filters by `created_by = 'Alice Johnson'`, and my seed entry has that same creator, so it'll be included. The event type \"client_note_added\" should trigger the client icon through both `getEventIcon` and `ActivityIcon` checks. For the task-related test, Alice already has a \"task_created\" event with the word \"task\" in both the type and description, so that should work too. I need to account for a few practical considerations: parallel test execution means each database is isolated so seed data stays consistent, I'll fetch user IDs through the API rather than hardcoding them, and I should use data-testid attributes for reliable element selection with generous timeouts. For the heading assertion, Playwright's `getByRole` is the right approach rather than checking the tag name directly.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether I actually need to modify the seed data at all. Looking through the timeline events, all the client-related activity is attributed to 'System', so no existing user has notes on clients. That means I'll need to either seed that data or create it within the test itself. Let me go with modifying the seed to add a note action for one of the users on the Acme Corp client, since the test spec is checking that this activity displays correctly in the app. I'm settling on modifying the seed data to add a client-related timeline event for testing—it's the simplest approach and won't break existing tests since nothing checks event counts. Now I need to write out the complete test file and double-check how the due date formatting works. Writing the test file... I'm going to stick with the API approach to verify the order is preserved correctly, and keep the other assertions straightforward. For test isolation, I'll have each test navigate to the user page independently rather than relying on a shared setup. Now I'm setting up the test file structure with the necessary imports and interfaces.\n\nWriting test helper functions...\n\nI'm checking whether the API call will work before navigation—the baseURL is configured in Playwright, so `page.request.get` should resolve correctly to the Netlify function endpoint. Now I need to write out the actual test suite, being careful about the record count assertions since these tests only read from seed data rather than modifying it. has its own isolated database. So fixed counts should be fine for seed data.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance: if other tests in the same spec file create/modify records, the counts could change. Since my spec file only reads data, fixed counts are safe.\n\nActually wait, what about other tests in the same worker? Since tests within the same spec file share a worker and database branch, and my tests don't modify anything, fixed counts should be fine.\n\nLet me verify the expected counts. Alice has 3 deals, 2 tasks, and for activity I'm counting 8 timeline events plus 7 deal history entries, which gives me 15 total activity entries. The UNION ALL query limits to 20 per subquery and 20 total, so all 15 entries will be returned without hitting any limits.\n\nNow I'm checking Carol Lee's data for the deals tests—she owns two leads: TechStart Pilot at $30K and NextGen Starter Package at $20K, plus a demo task for TechStart. Writing the test function... I'm restructuring this into a single spec file with multiple describe blocks to keep things organized, and I'll add a todoWrite for tracking progress as I build out the complete test file with the necessary interfaces and test cases. Writing test cases... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases...\n\nActually, I'm realizing the client-related actions test might be flawed since I haven't updated the seed data yet to include that event. I need to add a timeline_events entry to the database seed to make sure that test has the data it's checking for.\n\nLet me verify the schema columns match what I'm trying to insert...\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test regex will actually match the description I'm using. The pattern `/[Cc]lient|note on/` should catch \"client\" in \"Added note on client 'Acme Corp'\", so that should work for the activity feed test.\n\nFor the \"Multiple activity entries\" test, I need to be careful about how I structure the assertions—I'm not using `.toPass()` with Playwright locators, so that constraint doesn't apply here, but I should still make sure my expectations align with what the seed data actually provides. I'm realizing the activity feed might load separately from the header, so I should explicitly wait for it to be visible before checking the count. But actually, since `navigateToUser` already waits for the header and they're fetched together, the entire page should be rendered by that point—so the existing wait should be sufficient.\n\nLet me stop overthinking this and just finalize the implementation. I need to add a timeline event to the seed data, write out the full test suite with all 36 tests, and then run a type check to make sure everything compiles.\n\nAdding timeline event to seed... I need to insert a new audit log entry for a client note before the final entry, adding a comma after the previous record and placing the new one right before the ON CONFLICT clause.\n\nNow I'm refactoring the test to use Playwright's built-in retry logic instead of extracting text and relying on Jest assertions, which aligns better with the testing guidelines. I'm verifying that the displayed activity descriptions match the API response in the correct order, using Playwright's built-in retry logic with `toHaveText()`. For the timestamp validation, I should use `not.toHaveText(\"\")` to check that the element contains text rather than manually extracting and checking the length. I'm refactoring the tests to use Playwright's native assertions instead of extracting text manually. For the join date test, I can use `toHaveText` with a regex pattern directly on the element. For the activity count test, I need to find a way to assert on the number of elements since Playwright doesn't have a direct \"at least N\" matcher.\n\nI can check that the 5th element exists and is visible, which implicitly confirms there are at least 5 items and gives me the retry logic for free. Now I'm thinking through the stats test — there's a potential issue where the page might already have fetched stale data before I make my verification API call, though with seed data this shouldn't actually be a problem. Let me trace through the flow to make sure the timing works out. I'm verifying that Playwright's `getByRole` with the `level` option works correctly for finding h1 headings by accessible name, and it does. Now I need to create the test file and update the build script to include it.\n\nLet me trace through the date formatting logic to confirm the expected output format...\n\nSo Alice's tasks should display as \"Due Mar 1, 2025\" and \"Due Mar 15, 2025\" respectively, ordered by their due dates.
