It uses a\n    57→separate config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) that launches the Replay browser\n    58→via `@replayio/playwright` and auto-uploads recordings. It does not start a dev server\n    59→or reuse the integration test config.\n    60→\n    61→#### Analyzing the Recording\n    62→\n    63→After the test runs and the recording is uploaded, use Replay MCP tools to analyze\n    64→the recording and verify the app works correctly. If the test fails, use the recording\n    65→to diagnose the root cause before attempting a fix.\n    66→\n    67→A deployment is only complete when the Replay recording confirms that the app displays data and\n    68→supports updates. Record the Replay recording ID in the deployment notes.\n    69→\n    70→Read these skills to learn how to use these:\n    71→\n    72→https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-playwright/SKILL.md\n    73→https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-mcp/SKILL.md\n    74→\n    75→## Tips\n    76→\n    77→- Do NOT use the `replayio record <url>` CLI to create recordings. It launches a headed browser\n    78→  which will crash in this headless container (`Missing X server or $DISPLAY`). Always use the\n    79→  Playwright deployment test config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) which runs headless with\n    80→  `@replayio/playwright` and handles browser setup correctly.\n    81→- Do NOT install or start Xvfb. All browsers must run headless. If a browser complains about\n    82→  a missing display, the fix is to ensure it runs headless, not to add a virtual display.\n    83→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n    84→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for verifying the deployment. If the\n    85→  upload is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish.

See `strategies/scripts/deploy.md` for the full\nscript specification. The script handles database creation/sync, Netlify site creation/update,\nand writes the deployed URL to `deployment.txt`.\n\n## Testing\n\nAfter deploying, you MUST perform a functional test to verify the app actually works in production.\nA deployment that serves HTTP 200 is not sufficient — the app must display real data and support updates.\nThe deployment test lives at `tests/deployment.spec.ts`, separate from the integration tests.\nIt must be excluded from regular `npm run test` runs by adding it to `testIgnore` in\n`playwright.config.ts`:\n\n```ts\ntestIgnore: ['**/deployment.spec.ts'],\n```\n\nThe deployment test has its own config at `playwright.deployment.config.ts` which uses\n`@replayio/playwright` to launch the Replay browser and auto-upload recordings.\nAll browsers must run headless — never use Xvfb or set `DISPLAY`.\n\n```\nnpx playwright test --config playwright.deployment.config.ts\n```\n\n### Functional Test Requirements\n\nThe functional test must verify:\n1. **Data displays**: Navigate to the main page and confirm that real data (e.g. client records) loads and renders visibly.\n2. **Data can be updated**: Perform a write operation (e.g. add or edit a record) and confirm the change persists.\n\nIf either check fails, the deployment is broken and must be investigated and fixed before marking the job complete.\n\n### Recording with Replay\n\nAll functional tests MUST be recorded using the Replay Playwright integration so that\nthe Replay browser is used to launch and interact with the deployed page, and failures\ncan be debugged from the recording.\n\nThe deployment test is a SINGLE Playwright test at `tests/deployment.spec.ts` that\nruns against the deployed production URL (read from `deployment.txt`). It uses a\nseparate config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) that launches the Replay browser\nvia `@replayio/playwright` and auto-uploads recordings. It does not start a dev server\nor reuse the integration test config.\n\n#### Analyzing the Recording\n\nAfter the test runs and the recording is uploaded, use Replay MCP tools to analyze\nthe recording and verify the app works correctly. If the test fails, use the recording\nto diagnose the root cause before attempting a fix.\n\nA deployment is only complete when the Replay recording confirms that the app displays data and\nsupports updates. Record the Replay recording ID in the deployment notes.\n\nRead these skills to learn how to use these:\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-playwright/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-mcp/SKILL.md\n\n## Tips\n\n- Do NOT use the `replayio record <url>` CLI to create recordings. It launches a headed browser\n  which will crash in this headless container (`Missing X server or $DISPLAY`). Always use the\n  Playwright deployment test config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) which runs headless with\n  `@replayio/playwright` and handles browser setup correctly.\n- Do NOT install or start Xvfb. All browsers must run headless. If a browser complains about\n  a missing display, the fix is to ensure it runs headless, not to add a virtual display.\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for verifying the deployment. If the\n  upload is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT decide you have \"enough information\"\n  and proceed without the recording — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis cycle.\n","numLines":87,"startLine":1,"totalLines":87}}}
