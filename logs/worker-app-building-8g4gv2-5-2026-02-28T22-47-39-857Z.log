[2026-02-28T22:45:42.282Z] Running task: 1 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md)
[2026-02-28T22:45:42.282Z]   - WriteAppBuilderEvent: Create netlify/functions/app-builder-event.ts backend function. This is a webhook endpoint that receives POST requests from app-building containers reporting events (e.g. task started, task completed, error, container stopped). Validate the WEBHOOK_SECRET env var against the Authorization header or a secret query param. Parse the event payload and upsert the containers table (update status, last_event_at) and insert into webhook_events table. Return appropriate status codes.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target.

This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements.

When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

Webhook Endpoint Design Guidance\n\nBased on everything read, here is what a webhook endpoint should look like:\n\n**Expected webhook event payload fields** (based on the `webhook_events` table schema):\n- `container_id` (TEXT, required) -- which container sent the event\n- `event_type` (TEXT, required) -- the type of event (e.g., 'status_change', 'build_started', 'build_progress', 'build_complete', 'deploy', 'error', etc.)\n- `payload` (JSONB object, optional, defaults to `{}`) -- flexible data specific to the event type\n\nThe endpoint should also **update** `containers.last_event_at` when a new event is received, and potentially update `containers.status` based on the event type.\n\n**Following the existing Netlify function pattern, the webhook function would:**\n\n```typescript\nimport type { Context } from '@netlify/functions'\nimport { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless'\n\nexport default async (request: Request, context: Context) => {\n  // Only accept POST\n  if (request.method !== 'POST') {\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Method not allowed' }), {\n      status: 405,\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    })\n  }\n\n  const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!)\n  const body = await request.json() as {\n    container_id: string\n    event_type: string\n    payload?: Record<string, unknown>\n  }\n\n  // Validate required fields\n  // Insert into webhook_events\n  // Update containers.last_event_at (and possibly containers.status)\n  // Return success response\n}\n```\n\n**Key configuration note from `netlify.toml`:** Functions are served from `netlify/functions/` directory. Any new `.ts` file there becomes an endpoint at `/.netlify/functions/<filename>`."}],"totalDurationMs":63092,"totalTokens":38272,"totalToolUseCount":17,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1646,"cache_read_input_tokens":33853,"output_tokens":2772,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1646},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}
