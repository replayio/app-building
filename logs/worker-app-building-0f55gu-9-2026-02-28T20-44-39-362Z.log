Let me review the directives again and systematically check each test entry.\n\n**testSpec.md Directives to check:**\n1. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n2. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\n3. For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\n4. For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying change is persisted and side effects occur.\n5. Button and control appearance matters: verify specific text, icons, or styling.\n6. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n7. Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\n8. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.\n9. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions visible in UI.\n10. State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update appropriately.\n11. Images of different pages might not have consistent styling — prioritize consistency.\n\nLet me read the AppSpec.md to compare mockup details against test entries.\n[read] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/AppSpec.md\nAPI Error: 500 {\"type\":\"error\",\"error\":{\"type\":\"api_error\",\"message\":\"Internal server error\"},\"request_id\":\"req_011CYV9n3cdnKPFFUnSNXDvX\"}\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 77028ms | Turns: 21 | Cost: $0.4189\nCost: $0.4189 (total: $18.0496)\nTurns: 21\nTask failed 3 times.

Let me start with the components for the first subtask - checking testSpec.md directives against the DashboardPage test entries.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecDashboardPage\n\nI need to check each DashboardPage test entry against the testSpec.md directives. Let me review the directives again and systematically check each test entry.\n\n**testSpec.md Directives to check:**\n1. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n2. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\n3. For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\n4. For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying change is persisted and side effects occur.\n5. Button and control appearance matters: verify specific text, icons, or styling.\n6. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n7. Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\n8. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.\n9. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions visible in UI.\n10. State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update appropriately.\n11. Images of different pages might not have consistent styling — prioritize consistency.\n\nLet me read the AppSpec.md to compare mockup details against test entries.\n[read] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/AppSpec.md\nAPI Error: 500 {\"type\":\"error\",\"error\":{\"type\":\"api_error\",\"message\":\"Internal server error\"},\"request_id\":\"req_011CYV9n3cdnKPFFUnSNXDvX\"}\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 77028ms | Turns: 21 | Cost: $0.4189\nCost: $0.4189 (total: $18.0496)\nTurns: 21\nTask failed 3 times.
