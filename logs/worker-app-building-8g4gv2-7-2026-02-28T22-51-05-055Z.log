[2026-02-28T22:49:40.238Z] Running task: 1 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md)
[2026-02-28T22:49:40.238Z]   - WriteSetDefaultPrompt: Create netlify/functions/set-default-prompt.ts backend function. This is a webhook endpoint (POST) that sets the default prompt used by SpawnContainer when no prompt is provided. Validate WEBHOOK_SECRET. Accept a JSON body with a prompt field. Upsert the settings table with key='default_prompt'. Also support GET to retrieve the current default prompt (no auth required for GET, used by the frontend status page).

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    39→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    40→\n    41→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    42→\n    43→## Task System\n    44→\n    45→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    67→\n    68→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n    69→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    98→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    99→\n   100→## Database\n   101→\n   102→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   103→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   104→frontend components.\n   105→\n   106→## Quality Gates\n   107→\n   108→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   109→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   110→\n   111→## Commits\n   112→\n   113→The worker commits automatically after each iteration.

App page shows the above info with a link to the completed app (if available) and below that a feed with the AI output while developing the app, which is updated actively for in progress apps.  Request page is a wizard where the user describes the app they're looking for, then the system assesses whether it fits requirements (no personal info etc) and then either rejects the request with a reason or queues it and links to the page for the app.\n     3→\n     4→Pages:\n     5→\n     6→1. MainPage (/)\n     7→   Description: Main landing page for the autonomous app builder. Layout: at the top, there is a selector (e.g., tabs, dropdown, or segmented control) that filters which apps to show with three options: (1) apps currently being built, (2) apps that have recently been finished, and (3) apps that have been queued but not started yet. Directly below this selector, there is a prominent 'Request an app' call-to-action (CTA) button or section that navigates the user to the RequestPage. The main content area displays a list or grid of app cards. Each app card shows the app’s title and a short description, and each card links to that app’s dedicated AppPage. The page should support updating the visible list according to the selected filter, showing only apps in the corresponding state (in progress, recently finished, or queued).\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdqvIroDiRZOVD8n3oL79Tegv1adIFGkcmQ6HA\n     9→\n    10→2. AppPage (/apps/:id)\n    11→   Description: Detail page for a single autonomously built app. At the top, it displays the app’s title and description, matching or expanding on the information shown in the app card. If a completed app is available, the page includes a clear link or button to access or open the completed app (e.g., a URL to the deployed app or a download link). Below the main info section, there is a chronological feed or activity log showing the AI output while developing the app (e.g., status updates, logs, intermediate reasoning or steps). For in-progress apps, this feed is actively updated in real time or via periodic refresh, so the user can watch the development process as it happens. For completed or queued apps, the feed shows the historical development output or indicates that development has not yet started, respectively.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdR5c80FCuTrISNsDvKXJtHUEOBkned31bC8VP\n    13→\n    14→3. RequestPage (/request)\n    15→   Description: A multi-step wizard where the user can request a new app. Step 1: the user describes the app they are looking for, likely via a text input or form with fields capturing requirements and details. After submission, the system assesses whether the request fits policy and technical requirements (e.g., no personal information, disallowed content, or other restricted criteria). Based on this assessment, the wizard either (a) rejects the request, displaying a clear rejection message and a reason for rejection, or (b) accepts the request, queues the app for autonomous building, and then shows a confirmation screen with a link to the new app’s AppPage where the user can monitor its progress. The layout should guide the user step-by-step, indicate progress through the wizard, handle validation errors, and clearly communicate the outcome of the assessment.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kds5EP7hTtGH82bSwipudoBvMJrNqh1kgO3jVR\n    17→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01EqPemNdfiy7kHoc1h2mPsf","session_id":"d9ae96da-609c-41a5-8dff-6ff46e9576a3","uuid":"af72a9d5-a612-4744-af5b-ff993aae0773"}

Now I have all the information. Let me compile a comprehensive exploration report for you.\n\n---\n\n## Loop Builder App - Complete Project Structure Analysis\n\n### 1. App Directory Location\nThe app is located at `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder`\n\n### 2. AppSpec.md (Full Content)\n\nThe specification defines a three-page autonomous app builder application:\n\n**Page 1: MainPage (/)** - Landing page with:\n- StatusFilter selector (tabs: Building, Finished, Queued)\n- RequestAppCTA button to submit new requests\n- AppCardGrid displaying filtered app cards\n\n**Page 2: AppPage (/apps/:id)** - Detail page for individual apps with:\n- AppHeader (title, status badge, description, metadata)\n- AppActions (Open Live App, Download Source Code buttons)\n- ActivityLog with real-time feed updates for in-progress builds\n\n**Page 3: RequestPage (/request)** - Multi-step wizard for requesting new apps:\n- WizardStepper showing progress (3 steps: Describe, Assessment, Confirmation)\n- DescribeAppForm for app details\n- AssessmentScreen for policy/technical validation\n- RejectionResult or AcceptanceResult based on assessment outcome\n\n### 3. AppRevisions.md (Full Content)\n\n**Key Integration Points:**\n- Backend uses `@replayio/app-building` npm package for container lifecycle management\n- Uses `startRemoteContainer()` to launch Fly.io machines\n- Uses `ContainerRegistry` to track container states\n- Uses `httpGet`/`httpPost` for container communication\n- Database stores requests and metadata\n- Container state from registry is joined with database records at query time\n- Real-time feed polls container status endpoint at regular intervals\n\n### 4.

Netlify Functions Directory Structure\n\nAll functions are at `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/netlify/functions/`\n\n**Existing Functions (5 total):**\n\n#### a) **activity.ts**\n- **Method:** GET only\n- **Endpoint:** `/api/activity/:appId`\n- **Purpose:** Fetches activity log entries for a specific app\n- **Response:** JSON array of activity log entries ordered by timestamp DESC\n- **Auth:** No auth required (could be enhanced)\n- **Dependencies:** @neondatabase/serverless\n\n#### b) **apps.ts**\n- **Method:** GET only\n- **Endpoints:** \n  - GET `/api/apps` - List all apps\n  - GET `/api/apps/:appId` - Get single app\n- **Response:** JSON object(s) with app data\n- **Auth:** No auth required\n- **Dependencies:** @neondatabase/serverless\n\n#### c) **request.ts**\n- **Method:** POST only\n- **Endpoint:** POST `/api/request`\n- **Purpose:** Submit app request and assess against policy\n- **Validation:** Checks for disallowed keywords (personal info, passwords, malware, etc.)\n- **Response:** Either `{result: 'rejected', rejectionReason: string}` or `{result: 'accepted', appId: string}`\n- **Auth:** No auth required\n- **Database Operations:** Inserts into app_requests and apps tables\n- **Dependencies:** @neondatabase/serverless\n\n#### d) **spawn-container.ts**\n- **Method:** POST only\n- **Endpoint:** POST `/api/spawn-container`\n- **Purpose:** Creates and starts a Fly.io container for app building\n- **Auth Pattern:** \n  - Checks `WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable\n  - Accepts secret via Bearer token in Authorization header OR as `secret` query parameter\n  - Returns 401 Unauthorized if secret doesn't match\n- **Default Prompt Logic:**\n  - Looks for `prompt` in request body\n  - **If no prompt provided, fetches from settings table:** `SELECT value FROM settings WHERE key = 'default_prompt'`\n  - Returns 400 error if no prompt available\n- **Container Setup:**\n  - Creates unique container ID using random string\n  - Sets up containerEnv with git config, playwright path, webhook URL, and the PROMPT\n  - Calls `createMachine()` and `waitForMachine()` from @replayio/app-building\n  - Inserts container record into containers table\n- **Response:** `{container_id, name, status, prompt}` or error\n- **Dependencies:** @neondatabase/serverless, @replayio/app-building\n\n#### e) **app-builder-event.ts**\n- **Method:** POST only\n- **Endpoint:** POST `/api/app-builder-event`\n- **Purpose:** Webhook endpoint for receiving container events\n- **Auth Pattern:** Same as spawn-container.ts\n  - Checks WEBHOOK_SECRET from env\n  - Accepts via Bearer token or query parameter\n  - Returns 401 if unauthorized\n- **Payload Structure:**\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"container_id\": string,\n    \"event_type\": string,\n    \"payload\": Record<string, unknown> (optional),\n    \"status\": string (optional)\n  }\n  ```\n- **Database Operations:**\n  - Upserts into containers table (updates status and last_event_at)\n  - Inserts into webhook_events table (stores full event)\n- **Response:** `{success: true}` with status 200\n- **Dependencies:** @neondatabase/serverless\n\n### 6. Function Pattern Summary\n\n**Common Patterns Across All Functions:**\n\n1. **Imports:**\n   ```typescript\n   import type { Context } from '@netlify/functions'\n   import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless'\n   ```\n\n2. **Default Export:**\n   ```typescript\n   export default async (request: Request, context?: Context) => {\n     // function logic\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Response Format:**\n   - All return `new Response(JSON.stringify({...}), {headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}})`\n   - Consistent JSON response structure\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - Method check first\n   - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 405, 500)\n   - All error responses are JSON with `error` or `detail` fields\n\n5. **Database Access:**\n   - `const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!)`\n   - SQL queries using neon tagged template literals\n\n6. **Auth Pattern (for protected endpoints):**\n   - Check `process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET`\n   - Extract from Authorization header (Bearer token) OR query parameter\n   - Return 401 with error if not provided or doesn't match\n\n### 7. Settings Table\n\nThe **settings** table (6 fields: key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT) stores configuration:\n- **Used in spawn-container.ts** (line 54): Fetches `default_prompt` from settings\n- Designed as a simple key-value store for app-wide configuration\n- Currently referenced key: `'default_prompt'`\n\n### 8. Tests.md - No \"set-default-prompt\" Entries\n\nI searched through `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/docs/tests.md` and found **NO test entries** related to:\n- \"set-default-prompt\"\n- \"default-prompt\"\n- \"default_prompt\"\n- Settings management\n\nThe tests focus entirely on the three main pages (MainPage, AppPage, RequestPage) and their components.\n\n### 9. Key Dependencies\n\nFrom `package.json`:\n- `@neondatabase/serverless` - Postgres database client\n- `@netlify/functions` - Netlify Functions types/runtime\n- `@replayio/app-building` - Container management library\n- `@reduxjs/toolkit` & `react-redux` - State management\n- `react-router-dom` - Client-side routing\n- `lucide-react` - Icon library\n- Playwright for E2E testing\n\n### 10.
