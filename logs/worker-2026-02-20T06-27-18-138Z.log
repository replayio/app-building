There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    80→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    81→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019x4QqpiCQMeUXp2iV3qYT9","session_id":"82159325-80a8-4f42-98bc-8cbf54a4e3f1","uuid":"058361dc-383a-464c-8ed5-ff07eb1bb365"}

It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings.

Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    33→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    34→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    35→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    36→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    37→\n    38→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent.

Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory.

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it contains subsequent changes to the spec from bug\nreports and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

Let me organize my work:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientDetailPage\nCheck testSpec.md directives against ClientDetailPage test entries (section 2 in tests.md)\n\ntestSpec.md directives:\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler elements just because they're easier to build — if the mockup shows specific columns with joins or computed values, test all of them, and if there are four filter controls shown, test all four rather than just the easiest ones.\n4. Every clickable element needs a test that specifies exactly where it navigates or what it does, with no ambiguity about destinations. For buttons that open external flows like OAuth or payments, I need to document how they open (popup, redirect, etc.) and what happens when complete.\n5. For any action that changes data, I need to write test entries that verify the mutation.\n6. Button appearance matters too — if the mockup specifies particular text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that exact appearance, not just that a button exists.\n7. Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they work correctly.\n8. File uploads should be supported in attachment functionality unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must clearly specify the expected data format and file type, with that documentation visible to users before they attempt the import.\n10. Any backend integrations the user can configure — webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps — need complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n11. State-changing actions require tests that verify the change persists and only the correct side effects occur, with no duplicates.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking the ClientDetailPage test entries against these directives. Looking at the components listed — ClientHeader, QuickActions, SourceInfoSection, TasksSection, DealsSection, AttachmentsSection, PeopleSection, TimelineSection — I need to verify that all visible elements mentioned in the component descriptions are actually covered by test entries. For instance, the ClientHeader includes name, type badge, and status badge, but I should check if tags are being tested as well. Now I'm verifying the navigation directives—task, deal, and person links all route to their correct detail pages, and attachment links open in new tabs as expected. I'm also checking that mutations like status and tag changes persist with corresponding timeline entries, though the task mutation verification appears to be cut off. creation persists + timeline entry ✓\n- CDP-QA-05: deal creation persists + timeline entry ✓\n- CDP-QA-07: attachment persists ✓\n- CDP-QA-09: person persists + timeline entry ✓\n- CDP-TSK-02: task completion persists + timeline entry ✓\n- CDP-SRC-03: source info change persists ✓\n- CDP-ATT-04: delete persists ✓\n- CDP-TL-07: task creation atomicity ✓\n- CDP-TL-08: deal stage change atomicity ✓\nLooks good.\n\n**Directive 6 (button/control appearance)**: \n- CDP-QA-01 specifies icons and labels ✓\n- CDP-HDR-01 specifies badges ✓\n\n**Directive 7 (test modals)**: Now I'm going through each modal to check coverage. The Add Task, Deal, Attachment, and Person modals all have tests for opening and field validation, plus persistence checks, but I'm noticing the Cancel button behavior isn't actually tested in any of them despite being mentioned in the specs. I should also verify the confirmation dialogs are covered. and save. The Cancel button is verified as existing, but its actual functionality—closing without saving—isn't tested, which feels like a gap in coverage.\n\nMoving through the other directives: file uploads are covered with the dialog and PDF upload tests, import functionality doesn't apply here, and backend integration isn't relevant. For state-changing actions, the timeline tests verify atomicity across updates.\n\nNow I'm noticing something about the cross-cutting tests—DATA-01 through DATA-05 seem to handle whether changes propagate across the app, like when a deal is created showing up on the DealsListPage. But I'm wondering if there's an inconsistency in how timeline entries are being handled. The status and tag changes both create timeline entries, yet the client type change test doesn't mention one. Looking at the timeline examples, it shows various events like tasks and deals, so I should check whether type changes should also generate a timeline entry. the timeline description only lists specific event types like task creation and email sends, so type changes might intentionally not create timeline entries—but that creates an inconsistency since status and tag changes do generate them. I should verify whether this is a deliberate design choice or an oversight in the test coverage.\n\nLooking at the name editing test, it only verifies that the field becomes editable, not that the change actually persists or triggers any side effects like timeline entries. This looks like a genuine gap compared to the other header field tests, which all include persistence verification. editable, not that saving it persists the change. For type editing, there's no timeline entry documented even though status and tag changes do have them, which seems inconsistent with the directive about ensuring the right side effects occur. The clearest violation is the missing persistence verification for name changes in CDP-HDR-02. I'm also checking directive 2 about systematically inventorying visible elements—the test entries appear to cover the described components, though I can't fully verify without seeing the actual mockup. Now I'm looking at CDP-QA-04 to see what fields are specified for the deal modal.\n\nThere's a naming inconsistency across the spec—CDP-QA-04 lists the stage dropdown as \"Lead, Qualification, Discovery, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won\" but CDP-QA-05 saves the stage as \"Proposal Sent,\" which doesn't match. Comparing across other parts of the spec, DLP-FLT-01 uses \"Proposal Sent\" while CDP-QA-04 and DDP-PIP-01 use just \"Proposal,\" so the stage options aren't consistent throughout the requirements.\n\nI also notice that CDP-HDR-02 covers making the name field editable, but there's no follow-up test verifying that the edited name actually persists when saved—that's a gap in the test

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientDetailPage - testSpec.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images consistency - N/A (can't check without mockups)\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element - check each component's description against entries\n3. Don't substitute easier elements\n4. Every clickable element must specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. Data mutations must verify persistence and side effects (timeline entries)\n6. Button/control appearance matters (text, icons, styling)\n\n\n7. Modal dialogs need complete testing coverage\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must update other parts of app\n\nLet me go through the ClientDetailPage test entries systematically, starting with the header components. CDP-HDR-01 covers the name, type, status, tags, and source badge correctly. CDP-HDR-02 mentions editing the client name but cuts off before specifying what the expected result should be.\n\nLooking at the pattern across the other header tests, I notice CDP-HDR-02 has a gap—it tests making the name editable but doesn't verify that the change persists or check for side effects like timeline entries, which violates directive 5. CDP-HDR-03 and CDP-HDR-04 both properly test persistence and timeline updates for status and tag changes. CDP-HDR-05 tests type persistence but doesn't mention whether a timeline entry should be created, which seems inconsistent with how status and tag changes are handled.\n\nMoving into the QuickActions section, I'm seeing the buttons and modals are properly tested, but there's a stage naming inconsistency between CDP-QA-04 and CDP-QA-05—the modal lists \"Proposal Sent\" as an option but the test uses different stage values, which suggests the stage options aren't clearly defined.\n\nThe remaining quick action tests for attachments and adding people all check out. Now looking at the other sections—SourceInfo, Tasks, Deals, and Attachments all appear to be passing their validation checks so far. I'm noticing a gap in the modal testing—while the entries confirm that Save and Cancel buttons exist, there's no actual verification that the Cancel button works as intended across any of the modals, which seems to fall short of the directive to completely test modal functionality. More critically, I'm seeing that CDP-HDR-02 only tests entering edit mode for the client name but never validates that the change actually persists, which directly violates the requirement to verify data mutations are saved correctly.\n\nThere's also an inconsistency in how the stage field is documented: CDP-QA-04 lists the dropdown options as \"Proposal\" while CDP-QA-05 references \"Proposal Sent\" as the actual stage value, and since the code uses \"proposal\" as the value with \"Proposal Sent\" as the display label, the test entry should align these properly.\n\nNow I'm grouping these as violations that need fix jobs. For the CheckComponentsClientDetailPage component, I need to review the writeApp.md directives and identify which ones apply—things like ensuring test entries match the component requirements, verifying the visual design matches the mockup, adding data-testid attributes to interactive elements, using searchable selects instead of native HTML selects for entity references, supporting actual file uploads for attachments, and checking that the CSS and other structural requirements are met.\n\nLooking at ClientHeader.tsx specifically, I'm checking whether it satisfies these directives: it has testids on interactive elements, uses FilterSelect instead of native selects, displays all the required test entries like name and status badges, and appears layout-agnostic. Though I'm noticing the root element has `mb-6` which could be a margin violation depending on how strictly the layout-agnostic directive is interpreted.\n\nNow I'm moving through the directives systematically—first confirming data-testid attributes are present across all components, then checking that modals using FilterSelect for entity references are properly implemented, starting with AddTaskModal. I'm noticing a real gap here—the AddPersonModal only creates new persons, but the test spec CDP-QA-08 explicitly requires \"options to create a new person or associate an existing person,\" which is a violation of the requirement to match test specs. I should also check the ClientHeader component since it's using useState with props as initial values, and the guidelines suggest I need to add useEffect to keep local state in sync when props change.\n\nLooking at the state initialization code, there's no useEffect watching the client prop, so if the client data changes externally, the local state would become stale. The handleCancel function does reset to the current props, which partially mitigates this, but it's not a complete solution—this is more of a tips violation than a directive violation, though it could still cause bugs in practice. Let me continue checking for other directive violations. Now I'm going through each test requirement against the actual component implementation. The header displays all the required elements correctly, and the edit functionality works for name and status changes. For the status and tags updates, the changes persist through the dispatch action and should trigger timeline entries on the backend. I need to verify that the remaining test cases like type editing are also properly handled in the code. File uploads are persisting correctly. I'm noticing a critical issue with the Add Person modal though—it only supports creating new persons, but the requirements call for the ability to search and associate existing people as well. That's a violation of the directive. The rest of the checklist items are passing: person additions persist with timeline entries, source information displays and edits correctly, unresolved tasks show up with completion checkboxes and navigation working, and deal associations are visible.\n\nLooking at attachments, the preview system is working with proper type-specific rendering, filenames, type labels, dates, and linked deals all displaying. Downloads and view links function as expected, and deletions require confirmation. The people list shows avatars, names, and roles with proper navigation to detail views. Timeline events are rendering across all the test cases.\n\nThe main violation I'm seeing is that AddPersonModal needs to support both creating new persons and searching for existing ones to associate. I'm going through each component to verify they're using FilterSelect instead of native select elements, and so far everything checks out except AddPersonModal which doesn't have any selects at all—though that's not a violation since it's only creating new persons in its current implementation. I should also verify whether the backend functions comply with the neon query directive, but that's outside the scope of the component-level checks I'm doing here.\n\nNow I'm looking at the writeTests.md directives to check for violations in the client-detail-page test file, which covers things like navigation verification, side effect assertions, avoiding getByText with common words, consistent test IDs, proper file upload mechanics, and avoiding auto-wait calls inside retry blocks.\n\nLooking at the CDP-HDR tests, I see CDP-HDR-01 checks header visibility with proper getByTestId usage, but it's missing verification of tags and source badge that the spec requires—though those are covered separately in CDP-HDR-05. CDP-HDR-02 correctly tests edit mode with form fields and buttons, while CDP-HDR-03 tests cancel functionality, though it doesn't align with what the spec expects for status editing and persistence.\n\nNow I'm comparing the actual test titles against the spec requirements, and there are significant mismatches: CDP-HDR-01 in the test file says \"Client header displays client name, type badge, and status\" but the spec says \"Header displays client name, type, status, and tags\"—the writeTests directive requires these titles to match exactly. Same issue with CDP-HDR-02 where the test title doesn't match the spec's requirement about editing client name specifically.\n\nThe bigger problem is that CDP-HDR-03 through CDP-HDR-05 have completely wrong test implementations—the test file has tests about cancel mode, status dropdowns, and tag display, but the spec actually requires tests for editing client status, tags, and type persistence. The tests aren't just poorly titled; they're testing the wrong functionality entirely. Looking at the missing tests from the spec, I need to add coverage for editing client status, tags, and type with timeline entries. Then moving to the QuickActions tests, I'm seeing misalignments where the test titles don't match what the spec actually requires—the Add Deal and Add Attachment tests are testing modal opens instead of the persistence and section display behaviors specified. Looking at the source info tests, I see several mismatches between what's implemented and what the spec requires. The edit cancel test is labeled incorrectly—it should be testing persistence of changes instead. Then moving into tasks, there are multiple title and test mismatches: the visibility test doesn't match the spec about unresolved tasks, the checkbox test is completely wrong, and only the navigation test aligns properly.\n\nFor deals, the pattern continues with the visibility test being close but imprecise, and the deal navigation test having the right functionality but wrong ID mapping. I'm also noticing gaps in the test coverage—missing tests for detailed assertions on unresolved tasks, checkbox completion with timeline updates, deal associations, and proper detailed assertions for the deals section.\n\nLooking at attachments, I see similar issues: the visibility test is oversimplified, and there are significant mismatches where tests are checking for display properties when the spec actually requires download and view link functionality. The delete confirmation test does align properly, but I'm missing coverage for the download and view link interactions entirely.\n\nFor people, the section visibility test is again simplified, and I only see the name display test so far—likely more gaps ahead.\n\nThe timeline tests show the biggest problems: I'm testing generic grouping and descriptions when the spec actually requires validating specific event types like task creation and deal stage changes, plus atomicity checks. I'm missing tests CDP-TL-02 through CDP-TL-08 that would cover these specific scenarios.\n\nI'm also noticing the modal tests are using completely different ID prefixes—CDP-ATSK, CDP-ADL, CDP-APER, CDP-AATT—that don't align with the spec's naming scheme at all. And I need to verify I'm not violating the directive about avoiding getByText() with common words, especially in modal contexts where it could match unintended elements.\n\nMore critically, the attachment modal tests are missing actual file upload mechanics—they only check that the modal opens and has toggle buttons, but never exercise the real file input flow. The navigation test for tasks is also using a regex pattern that's too loose when it should be verifying the exact URL structure. a comprehensive fix strategy. I'm seeing that many violations share common root causes—mismatched test titles, missing side effect verification, and incomplete test coverage—so I should batch these into logical fix groups rather than addressing each violation individually. This will be more efficient than creating separate jobs for every single

Specifies badges and visual elements. ✓ Satisfies directive 2 (inventory elements) and directive 6 (appearance).\n\n**CDP-HDR-02**: \"Clicking edit on header allows editing client name\" — Expected only says \"Client name becomes editable (inline text field). User can type a new name.\" **VIOLATION of directive 5**: This entry describes a data mutation action (editing client name) but has NO follow-up entry that verifies saving the name change persists, and no mention of side effects. Compare with CDP-HDR-03 (status change persists + timeline), CDP-HDR-04 (tags persist + timeline), CDP-HDR-05 (type persists).\n\n**CDP-HDR-03**: Status change persists + timeline entry. ✓\n\n**CDP-HDR-04**: Tag change persists + timeline entry. ✓\n\n**CDP-HDR-05**: Type change persists, but does NOT mention a timeline entry.

Stage dropdown lists \"Lead, Qualification, Discovery, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won\". **VIOLATION of directive 3 (don't substitute)**: The actual app uses \"Proposal Sent\" as the label (matching DLP-FLT-01 which says \"Proposal Sent\"). This entry says just \"Proposal\" — inconsistent with the rest of the spec.\n\n**CDP-QA-05**: Deal creation persists. References stage \"Proposal Sent\" — inconsistent with CDP-QA-04 which lists \"Proposal\".\n\n**CDP-QA-06 through CDP-QA-09**: All look correct. Attachment supports file upload ✓ (directive 8).
