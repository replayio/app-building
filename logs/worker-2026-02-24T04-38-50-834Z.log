This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

However, it doesn't show the Pipeline View in detail. Let me understand the violations I need to fix:\n\n**Job 1: Add Pipeline View deal card details (stage columns, card contents, card clickability) to DealsListPage test entries in docs/tests.md**\n\nLooking at the current test entry for Pipeline View:\n```\n#### Test: Pipeline View tab shows deals in pipeline/board format\n- **Given** the user is on the Deals List Page\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Pipeline View\" tab\n- **Then** the \"Pipeline View\" tab becomes visually highlighted as active\n\n\n```\n\nThis test is too vague. According to the testSpec.md directives:\n- \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section.\"\n- \"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\"\n- \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\nThe Pipeline View test needs to specify what stage columns appear, what information displays on each deal card, and which elements are clickable. I need to add the missing details about the Table View tab returning to its default state and the deals being grouped by stage columns, then continue building out the full card structure and interaction specifications.\n\nFor the second job, I'm looking at the mutation test requirements — when deals are created or deleted, I need to verify that timeline entries are created and that the client's Deals section updates correctly, with tests ensuring these side effects happen exactly once without duplicates.\n```\n\nThe Create Deal test already mentions the client's Deals section updating, but it's missing the timeline entry verification. The Delete Deal test mentions the summary cards and pagination updating, but it doesn't account for the client's Deals section being updated when a deal is removed. I should check if there's a timeline feature for deal creation by looking at the DealDetailPage.\n\nI see there's a DealHistorySection that tracks stage changes chronologically, but that's specifically for stage transitions, not general deal creation events. Let me examine what actually happens in the app when a deal is created and how the Client Detail Page displays the Deals

[2026-02-24T04:37:36.566Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01MRPouczamv9gP8xirMYEoN","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a good understanding of the issues. Let me also look at what timeline events are specifically tracked for deal operations to understand what's needed.\n\nLet me now look at the timeline events more carefully:\n\nFrom the ClientDetailPage tests, the TimelineSection tracks:\n- Task Created\n- Note Added  \n- Deal Stage Changed\n- Email Sent\n- Contact Added\n\nThere is no \"Deal Created\" or \"Deal Deleted\" timeline event explicitly mentioned in the timeline test entries. However, the \"Add Deal form creates deal successfully\" test does mention \"a timeline entry is created recording the deal creation.\"\n\nNow let me understand the two violations:\n\n**Job 1: Add Pipeline View deal card details (stage columns, card contents, card clickability) to DealsListPage test entries**\n\n\nThe Pipeline View test is too vague right now—it just says deals are displayed in a board layout grouped by stage columns, but it doesn't specify which stage columns should appear or what the column headers should be. I need to add specifics about the six stage columns (Lead, Qualification, Discovery, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won) and ensure each column header is explicitly tested.\n\nBeyond the column structure, I also need to verify the deal cards themselves show the right information—deal name, client name, value, and status badge—and that they're interactive. The test should also cover the drag-and-drop functionality for moving deals between stages.\n\nFor the mutation tests on DealsListPage, I'm noticing some gaps in cross-page side effect verification. The \"Create New Deal\" test mentions the deal appearing in the client's Deals section on the Client Detail Page, but it's missing the timeline entry that should be created. Similarly, the \"Delete\" action test is incomplete—it mentions summary cards and pagination updates but cuts off before covering what else should be verified.\n\nLooking at the job description more carefully, I need to focus on two specific additions: the \"Create New Deal\" test needs timeline entry verification, and the \"Delete\" test needs the client Deals section update verification. me check if there's a \"Deal Created\" timeline event type. Looking at the ClientDetailPage timeline events:\n- Task Created\n- Note Added\n- Deal Stage Changed\n- Email Sent\n- Contact Added\n\nBut the \"Add Deal form creates deal successfully\" test says \"a timeline entry is created recording the deal creation\". So deal creation does create a timeline entry.\n\nFor deletion, the ClientDetailPage tests don't explicitly have a \"Deal Deleted\" timeline event format, but by the same logic, deleting a deal should create a timeline entry.\n\nActually wait, the job description says specifically:\n- \"timeline entry for deal creation\" → this is what's missing from the Create test on DealsListPage\n- \"client Deals section update for deal deletion\" → this is what's missing from the Delete test on DealsListPage\n\nSo I need to add assertions for the timeline entry on the associated client when creating a deal, and verify the deal is removed from the client's Deals section when deleted. Now I'm checking whether drag-and-drop is specified in the app spec or just in the implementation, and I should also look at what tests are needed for the Pipeline View—like the stage column headers with counts, deal card contents, and clickability. Let me see if there are already any drag-and-drop tests in
