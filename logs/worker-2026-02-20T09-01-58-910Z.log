There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01429aQGVU4x3BpX1P8uHjtQ","session_id":"5b78ef3b-4819-4de4-91f3-0fa39204e4d5","uuid":"e48e985d-8e7f-42f4-82b0-9304d116dcba"}

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    30→\n    31→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    32→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    33→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    34→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    35→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    36→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    37→\n    38→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    39→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    40→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    41→\n    42→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    43→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    44→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    45→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    46→\n    47→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    48→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    49→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    50→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    51→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    52→\n    53→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    54→  ```ts\n    55→  await expect(async () => {\n    56→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    57→    const count = await cards.count();\n    58→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    59→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    60→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    61→    }\n    62→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    63→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    64→  ```\n    65→\n    66→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    67→  ```ts\n    68→  await expect(\n    69→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    70→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    71→  ```\n    72→\n    73→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    74→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    79→\n    80→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    81→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    82→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    83→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    84→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    85→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    86→\n    87→## Parallel Test Design\n    88→\n    89→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n    90→Write tests with this in mind:\n    91→\n    92→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n    93→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n    94→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n    95→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n    96→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n    97→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n    98→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n    99→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   100→  being unmodified.\n   101→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   102→  you need to interact with.\n   103→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   108→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   109→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   110→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   111→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   112→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   113→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   114→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   115→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   116→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01429aQGVU4x3BpX1P8uHjtQ","session_id":"5b78ef3b-4819-4de4-91f3-0fa39204e4d5","uuid":"69e0ad8b-64fe-4970-825f-0256ea4252f9"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data.

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it contains subsequent changes to the spec from bug reports and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

Webhook is persisted (page reload still shows it).\n\n**STP-WH-04: Platform setup guide shows instructions when clicked**\n- Initial: Webhook modal is open on /settings\n- Action: Click the \"Zapier\" platform button (data-testid=\"webhook-platform-zapier\")\n- Expected: Platform-specific instructions (data-testid=\"webhook-platform-instructions\") appear showing numbered setup steps for Zapier. A tip (data-testid=\"webhook-platform-tip\") is visible with platform-specific advice. Click \"n8n\" button to switch — instructions update to show n8n-specific steps. Click \"Custom Endpoint\" to see custom endpoint instructions. Click the active platform button again to collapse the instructions.\n\n**STP-WH-05: Payload format toggle shows JSON example**\n- Initial: Webhook modal is open on /settings\n- Action: Click \"Show payload format\" (data-testid=\"webhook-payload-toggle\")\n- Expected: A JSON payload example (data-testid=\"webhook-payload-example\") appears showing the webhook event structure with fields like \"event\", \"timestamp\", and \"data\". Click the toggle again to hide the payload example.\n\n**STP-WH-06: Delete webhook removes it after confirmation**\n- Initial: A webhook exists in the list\n- Action: Click the delete button on the webhook, confirm in dialog\n- Expected: Webhook is removed from the list. Deletion is persisted. Empty state message reappears if no webhooks remain.\n\n---\n\n## 9.

Let me now systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecSettingsPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in SettingsPage test entries\n\nLet me go through each testSpec.md directive and check the SettingsPage entries:\n\n### Directives from testSpec.md:\n\n1. **Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.**\n   - This is about implementation, not directly checkable from test entries alone.\n   \n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n   - I need to cross-reference with AppSpec.md to verify all SettingsPage elements are covered.\n\n3. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.**\n   - Same check needed against AppSpec.md.\n\n4. **For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.**\n   - The webhook tests (STP-WH-02 through STP-WH-06) all specify clear outcomes. However, the import/export section has a gap: STP-IE-01 just lists that buttons are displayed without testing their actual behavior, and only STP-IE-02 covers what \"Import Clients\" does. The other buttons in that section lack action specifications.\n\n5. **For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur.**\n   - Webhook creation and deletion are tested for persistence, but there's no test for editing webhooks even though the mockup shows edit buttons.\n\n6. **Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance.**\n   - I need to validate this against the actual mockups and AppSpec.md.\n\n7. **Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.**\n   - Only the Clients import dialog is tested; the other import and export dialogs aren't covered.\n\n8. **Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.**\n   - The import CSV test mentions opening the dialog but doesn't verify the actual file upload mechanism works.\n\n9. **Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.**\n   - The CSV format info test is too vague—it should explicitly verify what columns and formats are documented to users.\n\n10. **Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each supported**\n   - STP-WH-04 does this well by testing instructions for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints.\n\n11. **State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. History/timeline.**\n   - Settings changes probably don't need timeline entries since they're system config, not entity mutations.\n\nNow I'm checking the AppSpec to see what's actually specified for the Settings page, and I notice the webhook section mentions enable/disable toggles and edit/delete buttons—but I don't see a test for the toggle itself, only for deletion. I should also verify what the webhook list is supposed to display.\n\nLet me review the AppSpec to get the full picture of what the Settings page should include.","signature":"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

Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n    28→\n    29→2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. The Settings page has two sections: (1) Import & Export — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV. (2) Webhooks — CRUD for webhook configurations that can send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation.

Let me systematically check each directive against the SettingsPage test entries.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecSettingsPage - testSpec.md Directive Violations\n\nThe SettingsPage test entries are:\n- STP-HDR-01: Settings page displays header and sections\n- STP-IE-01: Import & Export section displays all buttons\n- STP-IE-02: Import Clients button opens import dialog\n- STP-WH-01: Webhook section shows empty state\n- STP-WH-02: Add Webhook button opens webhook modal with setup guide\n\n\n- STP-WH-03: Creating a webhook persists and shows in list\n- STP-WH-04: Platform setup guide shows instructions when clicked\n- STP-WH-05: Payload format toggle shows JSON example\n- STP-WH-06: Delete webhook removes it after confirmation\n\n### Checking Directives:\n\n**Directive 1: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n\nLooking at the WebhookSection component, I can see it includes a list of configured webhooks displaying name, URL, and event types. I need to verify whether the test entries adequately cover all the individual UI elements that should be tested separately.\n\nThe component mentions an enable/disable toggle and edit button for each webhook, but I'm only seeing a test for the delete action. I'm missing test entries for toggling a webhook on and off, and for the edit functionality where users can modify webhook settings and save changes.\n\n**Directive 2: For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.**\n\nLooking at the import/export section, there are seven buttons listed but only one has a corresponding test. I need to add coverage for the remaining import buttons (Deals, Tasks, Contacts) and export buttons (Clients, Deals, Tasks) to ensure each one properly opens its respective dialog or triggers the correct action.\n\n**Directive 3: Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format. Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.**\n\nThe current test mentions \"CSV format info\" but doesn't detail what that actually means. According to the app revisions, each entity type has specific column requirements—Clients need Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, and Date Acquired. The test should explicitly verify that the correct format documentation appears for each entity type before users attempt an import.\n\n**Directive 4: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.**\n\nI'm noticing the import dialog is only tested for Clients, leaving gaps for Deals, Tasks, and Contacts. The webhook modal edit flow also needs proper test coverage to ensure users can open the edit modal, make changes, and save them successfully.\n\n**Directive 5: For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly.**\n\nWebhook creation and deletion persistence are covered well, but I'm missing tests for the enable/disable toggle and for webhook editing—both of which modify data that needs to persist.\n\n**Directive 6: Backend integrations that the user can configure must include complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.**\n\nZapier, n8n, and Custom Endpoint setup instructions are tested, but Discord is mentioned in the app revisions as a webhook target without corresponding test coverage for its setup instructions.\n\nLooking at the violations across all directives, I'm seeing a pattern: the Import and Export buttons lack test entries entirely, STP-IE-02 is too vague about CSV format specifications, and the webhook toggle and edit flows aren't exercised by any tests despite being listed as features.\n\nNow I need to check the SettingsPage components to see if Job 2 has similar

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecSettingsPage - testSpec.md Directive Violations\n\nLet me go through each testSpec.md directive against the SettingsPage test entries (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01, STP-IE-02, STP-WH-01 through STP-WH-06):\n\n### Directive 1: \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\"\n\nThe component list in tests.md says:\n\n\n- **WebhookSection**: \"list of configured webhooks with name, URL, event badges, enable/disable toggle, edit and delete buttons\"\n- **WebhookModal**: \"Modal for adding/editing a webhook...\"\n\nBut there are gaps—no tests cover the enable/disable toggle functionality, the webhook editing flow, or the other import dialogs beyond the Clients import.\n\nLooking at the export buttons too, I notice Export Clients, Export Deals, and Export Tasks are clickable elements without test entries specifying what happens when they're clicked. The import buttons for Deals, Tasks, and Contacts also lack test coverage for opening their respective dialogs. And while STP-IE-02 touches on CSV format info, the import dialog tests don't consistently verify that format documentation is visible before users attempt the import.\n\nI'm also seeing gaps in modal dialog testing—only the Clients import dialog is covered, while the Deals, Tasks, and Contacts import dialogs are untested. The webhook edit modal needs a test for the full edit flow with pre-populated data. On the persistence side, there's no verification that webhook enable/disable toggles or edits actually save to the backend.\n\nLooking at the remaining directives, the backend integration setup instructions are well documented through the existing test entries, but I'm noticing the import and export buttons lack icon verification—though that's a minor gap since the Settings page itself came from AppRevisions rather than the original spec.\n\nSo the key missing test entries for Job 1 are: webhook toggle persistence, webhook editing flow, the three additional import dialogs with their format specifications, and the export buttons for downloading CSVs.\n\nI also notice STP-IE-02 doesn't clearly define what columns should appear in the CSV format info, which ties into the broader import/export testing gap.\n\nRather than fixing these immediately, I should group them by root cause—one group for the incomplete webhook lifecycle testing, another for the missing import/export test coverage, since they share common underlying issues. Looking at the actual violations more carefully, the webhook toggle and edit flows are completely missing from the test entries, and the same goes for the import/export buttons across deals, tasks, and contacts—these are all clickable elements that need explicit test coverage specifying what happens when they're used.\n\nThe CSV format info test is borderline since it technically verifies visibility but doesn't specify the actual column requirements or accepted values that the directive calls for.\n\nNow moving into Job 2 to check the SettingsPage components against their test entry requirements.\n\nChecking each test entry: the header, import/export buttons, and import dialog all have the right identifiers and content. The webhook section's empty state message is slightly more detailed than what the test expects, but that's fine since the test uses substring matching. The webhook modal also has all required elements, and I'm partway through verifying the remaining entries. I'm verifying that the WebhookSection has comprehensive data-testid coverage across all interactive elements—the section container, add button, empty state, and individual webhook items with their name, toggle, edit, delete, and URL attributes. The WebhookModal and ImportDialog components are also fully instrumented for E2E testing.\n\nNow I'm checking a few implementation directives: the webhooks backend function needs to use the neon

Violates: \"Systematically inventory every visible element\" + \"For every clickable element, specify the exact action result\" + \"For any user action that mutates data, verify persistence.\"\n\n2. **Missing test entry for editing a webhook** - The WebhookSection component description mentions \"edit buttons\" and WebhookModal says \"adding/editing\" but no test entry exercises the edit flow. Violates: \"Systematically inventory every visible element\" + \"Completely test modal dialogs\" + \"For any user action that mutates data, verify persistence.\"\n\n3. **Missing test entries for Import Deals, Import Tasks, Import Contacts buttons** - STP-IE-01 lists these buttons exist but only STP-IE-02 tests clicking Import Clients. The other 3 import buttons have no test entries verifying their action result. Violates: \"For every clickable element, specify the exact action result\" + \"Completely test modal dialogs.\"\n\n4. **Missing test entries for Export buttons** - Export Clients, Export Deals, Export Tasks are listed in STP-IE-01 but no test entries specify what happens when they're clicked. Violates: \"For every clickable element, specify the exact action result.\"\n\n5. **STP-IE-02 lacks specificity about CSV format documentation** - The directive says \"Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format. Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible.\" The entry just says \"CSV format info\" without specifying expected columns. Violates the import format documentation directive.\n\nNow let me mark Job 1 complete and move on to Job 2."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":159,"cache_read_input_tokens":70161,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":159,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5b78ef3b-4819-4de4-91f3-0fa39204e4d5","uuid":"ec3ecdd9-193d-47a8-a76b-16b579916105"}
