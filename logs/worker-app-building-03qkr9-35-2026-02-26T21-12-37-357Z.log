The AccountDetailPage components and tests\n\nLet me first figure out which app this is for. \n\nI'll start by checking the task queue and pulling up the skill documents to see what directives I need to validate against.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2761,"cache_read_input_tokens":23747,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2761,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"aa0b5911-b82a-416f-8dec-3f8c4cfb59ff","uuid":"c1a46cd8-fb5e-4863-81fa-2d5036151cab"}

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01174k6kK3oSMJmREKLKS8D8","session_id":"aa0b5911-b82a-416f-8dec-3f8c4cfb59ff","uuid":"4a2c9144-4ab5-409e-94e5-33962d4c5ee9"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   153→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   154→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   155→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   156→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01174k6kK3oSMJmREKLKS8D8","session_id":"aa0b5911-b82a-416f-8dec-3f8c4cfb59ff","uuid":"5276e315-ca03-4a81-a477-0446ecbfb0d0"}

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect.

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks.

Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01174k6kK3oSMJmREKLKS8D8","session_id":"aa0b5911-b82a-416f-8dec-3f8c4cfb59ff","uuid":"8d339889-a7ba-402d-9879-b758b230db0c"}

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Let me systematically go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecAccountDetail - Check testSpec.md directive violations in AccountDetailPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n1. **Images consistency**: Images of different pages might not have consistent styling or navigation. Prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images.\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element**: Every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n3. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements**: If a table has columns that require joins/computed values, test for all those columns.\n\n\n4. **Exact navigation target/action result**: Every clickable element needs a test entry specifying exactly where it navigates or what action it performs.\n5. **Mutation side effects**: Any user action that changes data must have test entries verifying the persistence and exact side effects.\n6. **Button and control appearance**: Test entries should verify that buttons match the mockup's text, icons, and styling.\n7. **Modal dialog testing**: Modal dialogs need complete functional testing.\n8. **Attachment file upload**: The system must support file uploads for attachments.\n9. **Import/upload dialogs format**: Import and upload dialogs must follow specific formatting requirements.\n10. **Backend integration instructions**: Config UI must display complete setup instructions for backend integrations.\n11. **State-changing actions update other parts**: Tests should verify that state changes propagate correctly throughout the app.\n\nNow I'm going through the AccountDetailPage test entries to check them against these requirements. Looking at the AccountHeader section, the existing tests cover the basic display and navigation cases well—the breadcrumb navigation test confirms the navigation target, and the NewTransactionModal test verifies both the button appearance and the modal opening action.\n\nFor the search functionality, the tests confirm that the search bar filters transactions and that clearing the search restores the full list. Moving into BudgetOverview, the tests validate both the data display and the visual states—including the progress bar color changes when approaching the budget limit and the appearance under normal conditions. The TransactionsTab tests start by confirming the default active state and checking that the table renders with the correct column headers. tests all 5 column headers.\n- **TransactionsTab displays transaction rows with correct data**: Good - tests specific data values.\n- **TransactionsTab View/Edit link opens transaction details**: Good - specifies the modal opens with pre-populated data.\n- **TransactionsTab View/Edit link for credit transaction**: Good - tests both debit and credit scenarios.\n- **TransactionsTab switching to Budget Details tab**: Good - tests tab switching.\n- **TransactionsTab switching back from Budget Details**: Good - tests switching back.\n- **TransactionsTab displays debit direction styling**: Good - tests visual appearance.\n- **TransactionsTab displays credit direction styling**: Good.\n- **TransactionsTab empty state when no transactions exist**: Good.\n\n### BudgetDetailsTab\n- **BudgetDetailsTab displays budget line items**: Good.\n- **BudgetDetailsTab displays progress bar for each line item**: Good.\n- **BudgetDetailsTab progress bar indicates over-budget items**: Good.\n- **BudgetDetailsTab shows all budget categories for account**: Good.\n- **BudgetDetailsTab item amounts reflect transaction data**: Good - tests state-changing action side effects.\n- **BudgetDetailsTab empty state when no budget items exist**: Good.\n\n### ReportingLinks\nThe reporting section covers displaying both report links and verifying they navigate to the correct destinations, including the Actual vs Budget Report and Transaction History Report.\n\nNow checking for potential violations: I need to verify I've captured every visible element across all components and ensure every clickable element has a test specifying its exact navigation target or action result.\n\nLooking at the breadcrumb, New Transaction button, search functionality, View/Edit links, tab switching, and report links—I've confirmed each one has a corresponding test entry that documents what happens when clicked. The BudgetDetailsTab test also covers how item amounts reflect the underlying transaction data, and I've noted the styling details like the filled button appearance and tab highlighting.\n\nNow I'm noticing a potential inconsistency: the test spec mentions the BudgetOverview warning threshold should trigger at or above 90%, but the actual code implements it at 80% or higher. Let me trace through the test spec more carefully to see if this discrepancy is documented. I'm realizing this is actually a spec-code mismatch rather than a test directive violation. Let me check the testSpec.md requirements systematically: the entries follow BDD format with proper titles and page grouping, components are indicated, and interactive elements are tested with exact navigation targets. I need to verify whether every clickable element is covered and whether the modal testing is complete according to the spec. Now I'm going through each component to verify all interactive elements are covered—BudgetOverview and BudgetDetailsTab are display-only, while TransactionsTab and ReportingLinks both have their interactive elements tested. I'm also checking that the NewTransactionModal directive is satisfied since the modal opens from multiple entry points and has its own comprehensive test section.\n\nBut I'm noticing a gap: the test for the Actual vs Budget Report link only verifies the dialog opens and the report type is pre-selected, but doesn't actually confirm the account gets pre-selected even though the ReportingLinks component passes the account name to CreateReportDialog. This seems to miss part of what the test specification requires for clickable elements.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, the test entry itself describes the expected behavior correctly—the account should be pre-selected. The issue is just that the Playwright test doesn't validate this part. Let me check if there are other state-changing actions I should verify, like the New Transaction button and how it affects the rest of the page.\n\nI see there's a cross-reference test in the NewTransactionModal section that confirms saved transactions appear in the AccountDetailPage's transactions list, which satisfies the requirement that state-changing actions have tests verifying their side effects across the app.\n\nLooking at the BudgetOverview component, there's no test case for when budget_amount is zero, which could be an edge case worth covering, though it's not necessarily a directive violation unless the mockup explicitly shows this scenario.\n\nThe AccountDetailPage test entries appear largely compliant with the directives—they follow BDD format, cover interactive elements, specify navigation targets, test modals, and verify side effects. Let me double-check the requirement about interactive elements needing JSX comments.\n\nThe directive states that every interactive element must be tested AND have a JSX comment listing which tests exercise it. The test entries themselves cover all interactive elements, but the JSX comments would be verified separately in the component code review. So the testSpec.md portion is compliant on the testing side.\n\nNow I should check what other testSpec.md directives might apply here. of different pages... consistent navigation/styling\" - Not really a testSpec entry issue, more about implementation.\n- \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\" - I checked the components and all elements seem tested.\n- \"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements\" - The TransactionsTab has full columns with joins (Direction derived from entries). ✓\n- \"For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result\" - Checked. ✓\n- \"For mutations, verify persistence and side effects\" - Checked with BudgetDetailsTab item amounts test. ✓\n- \"Button and control appearance matters\" - Checked. ✓\n- \"Completely test modal dialogs\" - The modals opened from this page are tested in their own sections. ✓\n- \"Attachment functionality should support file uploads\" - Not applicable to AccountDetailPage.\n- \"Import/upload dialogs format\" - Not applicable.\n- \"Backend integration instructions\" - Not applicable.\n- \"State-changing actions must have tests\" - Checked. ✓\n\nThe test entries look solid. Now I'm moving on to check the writeApp.md directives for component violations, starting with things like running npm checks, identifying test entries for components, matching visual appearance to mockups, ensuring data-testid attributes on interactive elements, and handling monorepo base configurations. Components should be layout-agnostic without outer padding. Now I'm checking each component to verify they follow the established patterns. AccountDetailPage has the correct padding on its content wrapper, uses NavBar, and abstracts JSX properly. AccountHeader has all the necessary test IDs but uses a fragment as its root element, so it doesn't add outer padding—which is correct for a component. so no testid needed for interactions. TransactionsTab and BudgetDetailsTab both look good—they have the required data-testids for empty states, lists, and individual items with dynamic IDs, plus no outer padding or native selects.\n\nNow I'm checking ReportingLinks, which needs testids on the container, title, and the budget and history links. Wait, I should double-check the requirements in writeApp.md about interactive elements needing test comments in the JSX.\n\nLooking at AccountDetailPage, the tab buttons have their testids in place. But I'm realizing the directive about JSX comments with test titles might be from a different spec file. Let me verify what writeApp.md actually requires versus what testSpec.md requires, then systematically check AccountHeader and other components for whether they have those inline comments next to interactive elements like the search input. Looking at the distinction between testSpec.md and writeApp.md, the JSX comments requirement is in testSpec.md but the writeApp.md directives are what I should focus on for component-level checks. For writeApp.md compliance, I need to verify data-testid attributes on interactive elements and consistent padding across pages, both of which appear to be in place.\n\nNow I'm checking the remaining writeApp.md directives: whether components are layout-agnostic without outer padding, confirming no native HTML selects are used for filters, and verifying that modals use searchable dropdowns. I also need to cross-reference the test entries in the spec against the actual code to ensure all requirements are satisfied—like confirming the AccountHeader displays the account name, category label, and breadcrumb navigation as specified.\n\nContinuing through the test entries: the New Transaction button triggers the right state change, the search bar filters transactions and has a clear function, and the BudgetOverview section correctly displays the heading, actual versus budgeted amounts, and percentage used.\n\nThe progress bar renders with appropriate styling, and there's a color warning class that kicks in at 80% usage, though the spec mentions 90% which is a potential mismatch. The under-budget state applies normal styling without warnings. Moving through the remaining test groups—TransactionsTab, BudgetDetailsTab, and ReportingLinks all appear to be implemented as specified. Now I'm checking whether the visual elements match the mockup requirements, particularly button variants, icons, and section layouts, though I can't directly compare against the mockups themselves.\n\nThe New Transaction button has the primary button styling, tabs use an active state class for highlighting, and transaction directions are styled with their own classes. The components seem largely compliant with the spec. One thing I'm noticing though is that the tab buttons in AccountDetailPage are defined inline rather than abstracted into a separate component, which technically goes against the directive about breaking JSX into separate files, though it's a minor issue since these are simple layout controls. it inline since it directly manages page-level state. Let me decide if this is a real violation...\n\nThe directive says \"All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\" The tab buttons are JSX rendered directly in the page. This is a violation of this directive. The tabs should be abstracted into a component (e.g., `TabNav` or similar).\n\nBut wait, these are only 15 lines of simple tab switching buttons. In practice, this is borderline. The directive is clear though: \"All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\" This would include the loading, error, and not-found states too.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The loading/error/not-found states are conditional branches that render minimal content. The directive might be more about visual sections of the page (like the header, budget overview, etc.) rather than every single div. Looking at the page structure, most major sections like the NavBar, AccountHeader, BudgetOverview, and ReportingLinks are already abstracted into separate components, but the tab buttons remain inline. The tab buttons section is meaningful enough that it could warrant its own component, though it's tightly coupled with the page's `activeTab` state. I notice the tabs have test IDs like `account-detail-tabs`, `tab-transactions`, and `tab-budget-details`, which suggests they're treated as a distinct section worth testing.\n\nNow I need to check if any components violate the spacing directive about not including outer padding or margins in their root elements. I'm examining each component's root element to see if they have inline padding classes or styles that should be controlled by the parent layout instead.\n\nChecking the tab buttons section more carefully - these are inline in the page and directly tied to the page's state management, so extracting them would require passing state down as props. This is a potential violation of the component abstraction directive, though it's borderline since the state coupling is tight.\n\nI should also verify the JSX comments requirement from testSpec.md about documenting interactive elements with test references.\n\nLooking at how the subtasks are structured, I realize subtask 1 focuses on testSpec directives within the test entries themselves, not the component code. The JSX comments requirement would fall under subtask 3, which checks writeTests.md directives in the actual test files. Since I'm currently on subtask 2 examining writeApp.md compliance in components, I should stay focused on that scope. I need to be precise about which directives belong to which subtask. The JSX comments directive comes from testSpec.md, so it should be checked during subtask 1 when I'm reviewing testSpec.md directives against the test documentation—not during subtask 2 when I check writeApp.md directives in the component code itself. but it applies to code - this falls into a gray area. The check subtask says \"Check testSpec.md directive violations in AccountDetailPage test entries\" - so I should check test entries, not code, for testSpec.md violations. The JSX comments are in code. So this would be caught during a different check (if there were a \"CheckTestSpecCode\" subtask), but not in these three subtasks.\n\nActually, you know what, I think the JSX comment directive affects both the test spec and the code. The check for \"test entries\" includes ensuring test entries are written for all interactive elements. Let me focus on what I can check and not get too caught up in categorization.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n### Subtask 1: testSpec.md directives in AccountDetailPage test entries\nNo violations found. All test entries follow BDD format, have titles, are grouped by component, specify navigation targets, and test all interactive elements with side effect verification.\n\n### Subtask 2: writeApp.md directives in AccountDetailPage components\nNo clear violations found. Components have data-testids, page has consistent padding, components are layout-agnostic, no native selects, and JSX is mostly abstracted into components.\n\n### Subtask 3: writeTests.md directives in AccountDetailPage tests\n\nNow I'm checking the test file against the writeTests.md directives: tests must verify navigation targets precisely, components available across multiple pages shouldn't use page.goto() as a workaround, side effects need both primary and secondary verification with exact assertions, getByText() should be avoided for common words in favor of getByTestId, and data-testid values should remain consistent. across test files. File uploads should exercise actual mechanics, and I need to avoid nesting auto-wait locators inside .toPass(). I'll keep beforeEach clean without unnecessary state cleanup, use generous timeouts for backend operations around 30 seconds, and mark multi-step flows with test.slow(). Skill file paths should follow the /repo/skills/tasks/ convention, and I need to verify data-testid values directly from the component source. I should handle empty-state scenarios gracefully, check that API endpoints are healthy before deployment tests, exercise the exact fields mentioned in specs, and include complete end-to-end auth flows with email verification. Tests should be designed for parallel execution without relying on fixed counts, with fullyParallel enabled and Chromium replay browser, plus a global timeout of at least 60 seconds.\n\nNow I'm checking the test file against these directives. Navigation targets are verified through breadcrumb tests that confirm URL changes and page visibility, and the ReportingLinks tests check that the dialog content displays correctly with the right report type classes active. Component visibility across multiple pages isn't applicable here, and I'm examining the side effects in the BudgetDetailsTab item. Now checking the timeout values on assertions — the `toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 5000 })` on line 54 is waiting for client-side filtering to complete, which might be tight under Replay recording conditions, though it's borderline acceptable.\n\nThe `test.slow()` marker is appropriately used for the multi-step transaction test, while the other tests are mostly single-step navigations that don't warrant it.\n\nFor parallel test design, the tests avoid fixed record counts and use targeted filtering, so they should run safely in parallel. The specific assertion about Utilities amounts ($250.00 after adding $50) is acceptable since the test creates its own transaction and the other tests in the file don't modify that baseline data.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test implementations match their spec entries. The TransactionsTab tests verify the expected transaction details like description, date, and account allocations, which aligns with what's specified. Moving on to validate the credit transaction test against its spec.\n\nFor the ReportingLinks tests, I need to verify that the Actual vs Budget Report link properly navigates to the report dialog and pre-configures it with the correct settings.\n\nThe first test checks that clicking the budget reporting link opens the dialog and sets the report type to Budget vs Actual, but it's missing a verification that the \"Main Checking\" account is actually pre-selected as the spec requires.\n\nThe second test has the same gap—it verifies the report type gets set to Detailed Transactions but doesn't assert that the account selection is pre-populated.\n\nBoth of these violate the writeTests.md rule about testing exact fields mentioned in specs. I should also verify the other tests are properly checking their specified behaviors, like the AccountHeader breadcrumb navigation and search filtering. Checking off the test spec entries against their actual test implementations - all the AccountHeader tests are matching up correctly, and I'm moving through the BudgetOverview section to verify those align as well. I'm continuing through the test cases for the TransactionsTab component, verifying that transaction rows render with the correct data, the View/Edit links work for both debit and credit transactions, and that switching between tabs functions properly. Continuing through the test cases for BudgetDetailsTab and ReportingLinks components, verifying that budget amounts sync with transaction data, empty states render correctly, and all reporting navigation links function as expected.\n\nI've found one key issue: the navigation tests for the Actual vs Budget and Transaction History reports don't verify that the account gets pre-selected in the CreateReportDialog—they only check that the report type is pre-selected, which doesn't match what the spec requires.

The testSpec.md directive says:\n\n\n\"Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\"\n\nThis directive has two parts: testing every interactive element (which I can verify in the test entries) and adding JSX comments documenting which tests cover each element. The second part is about the source code itself, not the tests, so I need to check the AccountDetailPage component for those comments.\n\nLooking at the components, none of them have these JSX comments with test titles next to interactive elements—that's a clear violation of the directive. This would be a substantial change requiring comments on every interactive element across all components. Before flagging it as a fix, I should check if this pattern is actually followed elsewhere in the codebase to understand whether this is a real convention or an aspirational directive that isn't consistently applied.\n\nActually, I'm overcomplicating this. The directive is explicit, and the AccountDetailPage components don't follow it. But I need to be careful about which subtask this belongs to—the JSX comment requirement is from testSpec.md, not writeApp.md, so it wouldn't be part of the component check anyway.\n\nLet me refocus and look more closely at the ReportingLinks test violation by examining the CreateReportDialog to see if it displays the pre-selected account.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":513,"cache_read_input_tokens":74875,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":513,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens"

The `AccountCategoryFilter` component doesn't seem to receive the account name for pre-selection. The dialog uses `defaultAccountName` only for the report name.\n\nSo the test spec says \"the account is pre-selected\" but the current implementation doesn't visually pre-select the account in any filter/dropdown. There's no account selection field that gets pre-populated.\n\nWait, actually the spec entries say:\n- Line 328-329: \"The app navigates to the CreateReportDialog or generates a report pre-configured to show the Actual vs Budget comparison for the 'Main Checking' account. The report type is set to 'Budget vs Actual' and the account is pre-selected.\"\n\n\n- Line 337-339: \"The app navigates to the CreateReportDialog or generates a report pre-configured to show the Transaction History for the 'Main Checking' account. The report type is set to 'Detailed Transactions' and the account is pre-selected.\"\n\nThe dialog has a category filter but no per-account selector, so `defaultAccountName` only affects the report name, not the UI state. This is a component limitation rather than just a test issue — the CreateReportDialog doesn't actually support account pre-selection in its interface.\n\nI need to distinguish between directive violations and implementation gaps. The test spec says the account should be pre-selected, but the test doesn't verify this, which is a writeTests.md violation. There's also a writeApp.md violation since the code doesn't implement what the test entry specifies.\n\nLet me look at the spec again more carefully. \"Pre-configured to show the comparison for the 'Main Checking' account\" might just mean the report is associated with that account through naming, not that there's an account selector in the dialog itself. And looking at the separate test entries for CreateReportDialog, I should check what they actually expect from the component. Looking at the test spec more carefully, I see the AccountDetailPage test for the Actual vs Budget Report link checks that the dialog appears and the report type is pre-selected, but it doesn't verify that the account itself is pre-selected—which is a gap since the spec explicitly requires the account to be pre-selected. This is a violation of the writeTests.md requirement that tests must check all fields mentioned in the spec.\n\nThe deeper issue is that the CreateReportDialog doesn't actually have a visible account selector showing the pre-selected account—the `defaultAccountName` is only used internally for the report name. So this is both a test gap and a missing feature in the code itself.\n\nI'm also noticing that none of the AccountDetailPage components have JSX comments with test titles, which violates the testSpec requirement.

These separate test entries for the CreateReportDialog cover the account pre-selection behavior in more detail. They say:\n- \"All account categories remain checked (default state)\" - so no specific account filtering\n- \"The generated report name includes the account name\"\n\nAnd looking back at the AccountDetailPage test entries:\nLine 328-329: \"The report type is set to 'Budget vs Actual' and the account is pre-selected.\"\n\nHmm, but \"pre-selected\" in the AccountDetailPage test entry vs \"All account categories remain checked (default state)\" in the CreateReportDialog entry - there's a slight inconsistency. \n\nSo the CreateReportDialog entries are clarifying that the account name gets reflected in the report name itself rather than through a separate account selector field. The AccountDetailPage entry's mention of \"the account is pre-selected\" might be describing the same behavior but from a different angle - the account context is passed through to the dialog, which then uses it in the report name generation. These are really two perspectives on the same feature across different test sections. The report name is only generated on submit, so there's nothing visible to verify during dialog configuration. I think the AccountDetailPage tests are actually reasonable—they verify the dialog opens with the correct report type, while the CreateReportDialog tests handle the more detailed verification of account name reflection. This feels like a natural separation of concerns rather than a gap.\n\nBut looking back at the test spec entry itself, it explicitly states \"the account is pre-selected\" as an expected outcome. Even if CreateReportDialog has separate tests for that behavior, the AccountDetailPage test should verify all the outcomes listed in its own entry. That's a minor violation I should flag.\n\nNow examining the testSpec.md entries more closely, the language around account pre-selection is actually vague. The CreateReportDialog entries clarify that accounts remain in their default state and the account name appears in the report, but the AccountDetailPage entry's phrasing about \"the account is pre-selected\" doesn't quite match what's actually happening in the dialog. I'm noticing the test entries for AccountDetailPage and CreateReportDialog are testing the same behavior from different angles, which creates overlap. The AccountDetailPage test at lines 469-476 should verify that \"Main Checking\" gets pre-selected in the dialog, but it doesn't seem to check for that account name reflection.
