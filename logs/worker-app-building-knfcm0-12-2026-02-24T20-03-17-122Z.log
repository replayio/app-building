Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    99→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   100→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   101→\n   102→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   103→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   104→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   105→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   106→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   107→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   108→\n   109→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   110→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   111→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   112→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   113→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   114→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   115→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports.

Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3.

This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

I need to unpack this into subtasks - one task per page, containing all test entries for that page. Looking at the test spec, only the AccountsPage has actual test entries defined. The other pages (AccountDetailPage, NewTransactionModal, CreateReportDialog, ReportDetails, ReportList) have placeholder comments saying \"Tests to be added by PlanPage...\".\n\nSo I should create subtasks only for the tests that are actually specified. Let me group them by page - there's only AccountsPage with actual test entries.\n\nLooking at the skill instructions again:\n> Unpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`. Add one task per page, containing all test entries for that page.\n\n\nSince only AccountsPage has actual tests defined, I'll create a task for it with subtasks covering each test entry - starting with the NavBar tests like displaying the logo and navigation links, handling navigation to different pages, opening the NewTransactionModal, and the logout functionality, then moving into the AccountsOverviewHeader and remaining account-related tests. I'm formatting this as a single task for the AccountsPage that consolidates all 25 test entries.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3376,"cache_read_input_tokens":29358,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3376,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"37794142-9d65-4407-a235-dd403fe1a2fd","uuid":"9c5a961c-056c-4dd3-8bb9-84429295243c"}
