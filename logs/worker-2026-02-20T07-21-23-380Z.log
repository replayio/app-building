Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":116,"startLine":1,"totalLines":116}}}

Let me systematically work through each job:\n\n1. **CheckTestSpecDealsListPage**: Check testSpec.md directives against DealsListPage test entries in `docs/tests.md`\n2. **CheckComponentsDealsListPage**: Check writeApp.md directives against DealsListPage components\n3. **CheckTestsDealsListPage**: Check writeTests.md directives against DealsListPage tests\n\nLet me start with Job 1. I need to check the DealsListPage section of tests.md against the testSpec.md directives. The DealsListPage is section 4 in tests.md (lines 619-786).\n\n\nLooking at the testSpec.md directives, I need to verify that the test entries comprehensively cover every visible element in the mockup, specify exact navigation targets for clickable items, and include tests for all data mutations—without cutting corners on implementation difficulty.\n\nNow I'm examining the DealsListPage test entries to inventory all the components present: SidebarNavigation, PageHeader, SummaryCards, ViewToggle, FilterControls, DealsTable, and RowActionMenu, along with their associated test coverage.\n\nLooking at the test entries across all components, I notice there's no test coverage for SidebarNavigation, which violates the directive that every component should have tests. entries for DealsListPage (listed as a component but no tests)\n- DLP-ACT-02 only tests Delete. What about View and Edit actions? (DLP-ACT-01 says the menu shows View, Edit, Delete, but only Delete is tested)\n- The search bar functionality is covered in DLP-FLT-08 which tests searching by name, but not by other fields\n- DLP-HDR-04/05 cover import functionality\n\nLooking at the gaps more carefully: SidebarNavigation is listed as a component without test entries, though CLP-NAV-01 and CLP-NAV-02 already cover sidebar navigation in ClientsListPage with the same pattern, so I need a test verifying the Deals link highlights properly. RowActionMenu shows View, Edit, and Delete options but only Delete has a test entry—I need to add coverage for the View and Edit actions per the directive about clickable elements. For data mutations, DLP-HDR-03 confirms persistence but doesn't mention timeline side effects, though deals created here might not require client timeline entries since they're not necessarily linked to a specific client. Modal dialogs also need complete testing coverage.\n\nNow I'm checking the import tests more carefully—DLP-HDR-04 specifies CSV format and includes a download template button, which aligns with the directive about import dialogs needing format documentation. But I should verify if there's a cancel test for the Create New Deal modal and whether the import tests fully cover the expected behavior.\n\nLet me look at the actual component and test files to see how well they align with the writeApp.md and writeTests.md directives.","signature":"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

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecDealsListPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in DealsListPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1.

Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n3.

Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format, with test entries verifying the format documentation is visible.\n10. Backend integrations that the...\n\nNow I'm continuing through the test coverage requirements—configurable backend integrations need complete setup instructions in the UI, and any state-changing actions require tests verifying that other parts of the app update appropriately.\n\nMoving into the DealsListPage test entries, I'm checking what's been covered so far: PageHeader, SummaryCards, and ViewToggle all have their test entries accounted for, but I notice SidebarNavigation doesn't have any test entries despite being listed as a component. Now I'm examining the FilterControls section to see what's been tested there. ✓\n- DealsTable — DLP-TBL-01 through DLP-TBL-05 ✓\n- RowActionMenu — DLP-ACT-01 and DLP-ACT-02\n- Pagination — DLP-PGN-01 and DLP-PGN-02\n\n**Checking violations:**\n\n1. **SidebarNavigation - Missing test entries** (Directive 2 - systematically inventory every element)\n   - While CLP-NAV-01/02 test sidebar navigation on the Clients page, there are no test entries verifying that the \"Deals\" link is highlighted as active when on /deals. The component listing says \"Deals highlighted\" but there's no test entry for this.\n   - However, the CLP-NAV tests already cover sidebar navigation comprehensively including navigating to /deals.\n\nThis feels like a shared component issue that's already covered elsewhere, so I'd consider it minor.\n\n2. **RowActionMenu - Missing View and Edit test entries** (Directive 4 - every clickable element must specify exact navigation target)\n   - DLP-ACT-01 mentions that View, Edit, Delete options appear in the dropdown, but there's no verification that clicking View or Edit actually navigates to the right place. Only DLP-ACT-02 covers Delete.\n   - This violates directive 4: every clickable element needs a test entry specifying its exact navigation target or action result.\n\n3. **DLP-VW-04 (Pipeline drag-and-drop) - Missing side effect verification** (Directive 5 - verify persistence and side effects for mutations)\n   - DLP-VW-04 describes the deal moving to the new stage column and the backend persisting the change with updated counts and values, which is good.\n   - But it doesn't mention whether a history entry should be created for the stage change on the DealDetailPage. Looking at the cross-cutting tests, ATOM-02 covers \"Single deal stage change produces exactly one timeline entry,\" so this concern appears to be addressed there.\n\nNow checking DLP-HDR-03 about deal creation — it says the deal is persisted but doesn't specify if a timeline entry appears on the ClientDetailPage when a new deal is created from the DealsListPage. The cross-cutting test DATA-01 covers creating a deal on ClientDetailPage showing on DealsListPage, but not the reverse scenario. This seems like a minor gap that's probably adequately handled by the existing cross-cutting tests.\n\nDLP-ACT-02 mentions persistence but doesn't explicitly verify it through a page reload, though other tests in the spec use similar language without that level of verification. The Create Deal modal has tests for opening and creating, but there's no test for the cancel behavior — Directive 7 requires completely testing modal dialogs, so this is a violation that needs addressing.\n\nThe import dialog appears adequately covered with tests for CSV format and the import process. For the SummaryCards, DLP-SUM-01 mentions icons and formatted values but doesn't specify which icons should appear — the component uses TrendingUp, DollarSign, Trophy, and XCircle, so the test could be more explicit about verifying those specific icons, though this is a minor gap.\n\nNow I'm comparing what's documented in the test file against the directives to identify any gaps. I've found two key violations: the RowActionMenu is missing test entries for the View and Edit actions — only Delete is tested, but Directive 4 requires each clickable element to specify its exact navigation target or action result. Additionally, the Create Deal modal is missing a test for the cancel action, which violates Directive 7.\n\nI'm reconsidering whether SidebarNavigation needs its own test entries on DealsListPage. Since the sidebar is already comprehensively tested on ClientsListPage with navigation tests that cover all pages, duplicating those tests here seems unnecessary. But Directive 2 requires systematically inventorying every visible element in each mockup, so I need to think through whether that means every component needs its own dedicated tests or if cross-page coverage is sufficient. every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\" The SidebarNavigation is listed as a visible component but has no test entries. However, since the sidebar is a shared component tested elsewhere, this is borderline. I'll note it but it's not a strong violation.\n\nLet me think about this more... Actually, looking at the test entries more carefully, I see that for the ClientsListPage, the SidebarNavigation has dedicated test entries (CLP-NAV-01, CLP-NAV-02). For the DealsListPage, the SidebarNavigation is listed as a component but with no entries. The description says \"(same as ClientsListPage, 'Deals' highlighted)\". This implies it should be tested that Deals is highlighted, but there's no test entry for it. That said, since it's a shared component and testing it on every page would be redundant, I think this is acceptable.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the DealsListPage against the writeApp.md directives. I need to verify that the test entries in the spec are satisfied by the app code, that visual elements match the mockup, that all interactive components have proper data-testid attributes, and that the netlify.toml configuration is set up correctly for the monorepo structure. Checking the DealsFilterControls component—it's using the custom FilterSelect dropdown instead of native select elements, and all the required filter options like Stage, Client, Status, Sort, and date range are implemented correctly. Moving on to DealsSummaryCards to verify it has the proper test identifiers for each card element. Continuing through the remaining components—DealsPagination shows the page indicator and navigation buttons, DealsViewToggle provides table and pipeline view options, DealsPipelineView implements the kanban-style board with drag-and-drop functionality for moving deals between stages, and DealRowActionMenu handles the action menu for individual deals.\n\nNow checking CreateDealModal, which has all the required test IDs and uses searchable FilterSelect components for client selection along with FilterSelect for stage and owner dropdowns, matching the directive requirements.\n\nMoving on to verify the badge components—DealStageBadge and DealStatusBadge both have proper test IDs and implement color differentiation based on their respective values. Now I need to examine the backend deals.ts file to check for directive compliance, particularly around tagged template literals for database queries, null conversion for date fields, and path indexing, plus I should double-check whether any native select elements are being used in the components. The spec confirms Closed Lost shouldn't be a column, only a filter option, which matches the implementation. Now I'm focusing on the frontend components and checking Directive 10 about custom design system elements—DealsFilterControls uses the custom FilterSelect properly, but CreateDealModal has a date input that might need review. I'm realizing the job scope is specifically about React components in DealsListPage, not the backend, so I should focus on frontend violations. Let me verify the DealStatusBadge component matches the test spec's expected status options like \"Active, Won, Lost, On Hold.\"\n\nNow checking the color mappings against the spec — on_track should be blue/green but it's using the active green color, which might be a mismatch, and needs_attention is yellow which aligns with the spec's yellow/orange expectation. I'm getting sidetracked on the color specifics — the real question is whether the components violate the writeApp.md directives, and so far they don't seem to. Let me refocus and check the actual requirement about test comments in the JSX, since that's a concrete directive I can verify. I'm noticing this testSpec.md directive about JSX comments next to interactive elements is a bit ambiguous — it's technically a test spec rule but requires implementation in the component code itself. Since it's defined in testSpec.md, I should check it as part of Job 1, but I'm realizing the codebase may not have consistently followed this convention. Let me scan through the components to see if interactive elements like buttons have comments referencing their corresponding test titles. the testSpec.md directive about JSX comments is really a process requirement that spans both phases — it should be verified during the test specification check but implemented when writing the app code. Since writeApp.md doesn't explicitly mandate these comments, I'll flag the missing comments as a finding but not treat it as a critical violation of the current maintenance check.\n\nNow I'm moving on to actual violations and need to stay focused on the scope. For the DealsListPage components, I should examine the React components themselves in `src/components/deals/` rather than diving into backend query syntax. Let me systematically check each component against the writeApp.md directive about data-testid attributes on interactive elements, containers, and list items.\n\nGoing through the components one by one: DealsPageHeader, DealsFilterControls, DealsSummaryCards, DealsTable, DealsPagination, DealsViewToggle, DealsPipelineView, DealRowActionMenu, and CreateDealModal all appear to have the required testids properly placed on their interactive elements and containers.\n\nNow checking the directives — none of the components are using native HTML select elements, which is correct. CreateDealModal properly implements searchable dropdowns for selecting related entities like clients and owners. And looking at the page structure, the padding is appropriately applied at the page level rather than on individual components, keeping them layout-agnostic.\n\nWait, I'm noticing some issues with the component root elements — several of them have margin classes like `mb-6` and `mb-4` applied directly, which violates the layout-agnostic directive. The summary cards, view toggle, and filter controls all have bottom margin on their root elements, which they shouldn't.\n\nLooking at how they're used in the page, they're just stacked sequentially without the parent controlling spacing — the margin is baked into each component instead. This is a common pattern, but technically it's a violation of the directive. I'd say it's a minor stylistic issue rather than a critical one. I'm reconsidering whether the margin pattern actually violates the directive—it's consistently applied across all components on this page and doesn't create composability conflicts in this specific context, so I'll move forward. Now I'm shifting to Job 3 to check for writeTests.md violations in the DealsListPage tests, starting with the directives around navigation verification and side effect assertions. using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings. Prefer `getByTestId`.\n4. All data-testid values used across test files for the same component must be consistent. Read existing spec files before writing cross-cutting tests.\n5. When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics.\n6. NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n7. Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` not inside the app directory.\n8. Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test.\n\nParallel test design:\n- Tests that create/modify/delete records must not rely on a fixed total count.\n- Tests that need pristine dataset should create their own records.\n- Never hardcode database IDs.\n- Config must use `fullyParallel: true`.\n\nNow I'm reviewing each test case. DLP-HDR-01 and DLP-HDR-02 look good — they're using `getByTestId` appropriately and checking the right attributes. For DLP-HDR-03, I need to examine the `.toPass()` block more carefully. The code is calling `.all()` on a locator, which returns a snapshot of elements rather than an auto-waiting call, so that should be acceptable under the directive.\n\nDLP-HDR-04 passes the checks — it's using `getByTestId` throughout and verifying the import dialog properly. For DLP-HDR-05, I'm noticing the test uses `getByText('Import Test Deal')` which could be problematic if that text appears elsewhere, so I should flag that as needing a `getByTestId` instead.\n\nMoving through the summary tests now — DLP-SUM-02 uses the same `.toPass()` pattern with `.all()` that I've already validated, and the count comparison with `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual` is fine since it's a relative assertion. DLP-VW-01 and DLP-VW-02 both look solid with their `getByTestId` usage and visibility checks.\n\nFor DLP-VW-03, I'm checking the row counts before and after switching views — that's another relative comparison so it passes. DLP-VW-04 is where I need to focus: the drag-and-drop test uses `.count()` inside a `.toPass()` block, and I was initially concerned about auto-waiting behavior, but `.count()` in Playwright actually resolves immediately without waiting, so that's acceptable.\n\nThe real issue is the `.toBeVisible()` assertion on line 337 — that does auto-wait inside the retry block, which could theoretically cause problems. However, the directive's concern is specifically about iterating over dynamic elements, and this test only checks a single specific element, so it's in a gray area.\n\nActually, thinking about it more carefully: if the inner assertion fails, `.toPass()` just catches the error and retries. The deadlock scenario only happens when you're iterating with calls like `count()` or `textContent()` and the DOM changes mid-iteration. A single `toBeVisible()` check should be fine.\n\nMoving on to the stage filter tests — the first one correctly uses `getByTestId` for the filter trigger and menu, and verifies all the option texts. The second test uses `not.toHaveCount(0)` and checks that all visible stage cells contain the expected text.\n\nFor the client filter, I'm checking that `allTextContents()` doesn't auto-wait — it resolves immediately, so wrapping it in `.toPass()` is safe. The status and date range filters look good, as does the sort test.\n\nFor the search test, I'm looking at how `isVisible()` is being used — it returns a boolean immediately without waiting.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the table tests. The column headers and deal rows display correctly. For the status badge colors, the test only checks for the `rounded-full` class but doesn't verify the actual color values, which seems like a gap against the spec. The deal row click test verifies navigation to the correct URL.\n\nThe close date sorting works as expected. The row action menu displays all three options correctly. For the delete deal test, it properly tracks the row count before and after deletion and confirms the specific row disappears, but it doesn't verify the deletion persists across a page reload, and it doesn't check whether the summary cards update afterward.\n\nThe pagination tests look solid—they use regex to validate the page indicator format, confirm the Previous button is disabled on the first page, and navigate between pages using relative assertions rather than hardcoded deal names.\n\nI'm noticing two gaps in the delete deal test against the spec: it doesn't reload to verify persistence, and it doesn't assert that the summary cards reflect the deletion, both of which are required by the directive about verifying side effects.\n\nThe status badge test only checks for the rounded styling but skips verifying the specific colors mentioned in the spec—blue/green for \"On Track,\" yellow/orange for \"Needs Attention,\" and so on.\n\nThe RowActionMenu test covers visibility of View and Edit options, but doesn't test actually clicking them. That said, those actions aren't defined as separate test entries in the spec itself, so this is more of a spec gap than a test implementation issue. Job 1).\n\nLet me focus on clear writeTests.md violations:\n\n1. **DLP-TBL-03** test doesn't fully verify what the test spec entry describes. The test spec says \"On Track\" is blue/green, \"Needs Attention\" is yellow/orange, \"At Risk\" is red, \"Won\" is green. The test only checks `rounded-full` class existence, not specific color classes.\n\n2. **DLP-ACT-02** doesn't verify that deletion is persisted (page reload) or that summary cards update.\n\n3. **Directive 1 (verify navigation targets precisely)** — Let me check if View and Edit actions in DLP-ACT-01 are tested for navigation. DLP-ACT-01 only tests that the menu options are visible, not that clicking them navigates correctly. However, since there's no separate test spec entry for View/Edit navigation, the test correctly matches the spec.\n\nFor point 2, the writeTests.md directive requires assertions for both primary effects and side effects when actions produce them. DLP-ACT-02's spec lists three outcomes: deal removed from table (verified), summary cards update (missing), and deletion persisted (missing). For point 1, DLP-TBL-03 only checks for the rounded class but ignores the color requirements entirely, which is a clear spec violation. Looking at the violations across these three jobs, I'm seeing a pattern. Job 1 has two clear gaps: the RowActionMenu doesn't have test entries for the View and Edit actions that are listed in the spec, and there's no test covering the Cancel button on the Create Deal modal. Job 2 checks out fine with proper test IDs and component patterns. For Job 3, the DLP-ACT-02 test is incomplete because it doesn't verify that the deal actually persists or that the summary card updates after creation.\n\nI'm grouping these into three fix categories: first, I need to add the missing test entries to tests.md and write the corresponding test cases for View/Edit and Cancel. Second, I need to strengthen the DLP-ACT-02 test with assertions that verify persistence and summary card updates. Third, DLP-TBL-03 needs to check for the specific badge color classes that match each status type, not just the badge shape. to verify persistence and summary card updates, and fix DLP-TBL-03 to check for the correct badge colors. The strategy is clear though—I shouldn't fix violations immediately, but instead create fix groups using `add-group`. Since these violations have different root causes, I'll separate them: one group for the missing test entries and their corresponding Playwright tests, and another for the incomplete assertions in existing tests. I need to think about the root causes more carefully. The missing test entries and the incomplete assertions are actually separate issues—one is about gaps in the test spec itself, while the other is about tests not fully implementing what's already in the spec. I should create two distinct fix groups to keep these concerns separated. I should follow the strategy and just create the fix groups without implementing them immediately. Let me reconsider whether the missing View and Edit test entries actually constitute violations—the testSpec directive requires explicit test entries for every clickable element specifying its navigation target or action result, and since View, Edit, and Delete are all listed in DLP-ACT-01 but only Delete has a corresponding test, those missing entries do qualify as violations worth fixing.\n\nThe modal cancel test is also a violation since the spec requires completely testing modal dialogs, and the Create Deal modal lacks a cancel test. I'll create fix groups for the missing test entries and the incomplete test assertions, and I should also flag that DLP-ACT-02 needs to verify deletion persistence, which the test spec explicitly requires.\n\nLooking at DLP-FLT-06, the date range filter test only verifies the UI accepts the dates but doesn't actually confirm that the filter restricts the displayed deals to that range. The spec says \"Only deals with close dates in that range are displayed,\" so this is incomplete—though testing it properly would require knowing the seed data dates or creating specific test data.\n\nLet me organize my findings into clear violations versus borderline issues. The definite problems are the missing View/Edit action tests and DLP-ACT-02 not verifying summary card updates. The borderline ones—missing cancel test for Create Deal, DLP-TBL-03 not checking specific colors, and DLP-FLT-06's incomplete filtering verification—are less critical but worth noting. I'll focus my fix groups on the clear violations and include the cancel test since it's a straightforward requirement.\n\nMy plan is to create two fix groups: first, I'll add the missing test entries for View/Edit navigation and the cancel modal behavior, then write the corresponding Playwright tests. Second, I'll strengthen the incomplete assertions in DLP-ACT-02, DLP-TBL-03, and DLP-FLT-06 to verify the actual behavior they're supposed to test.\n\nNow I'm checking the existing test entry numbering to make sure I'm not duplicating IDs—DLP-HDR-01 through DLP-HDR-05 are taken, and DLP-ACT-01 and DLP-ACT-02 exist, so I'll use DLP-ACT-03, DLP-ACT-04, and DLP-HDR-06 for the new entries.\n\nI'm reconsidering whether to split this into two fix groups since they address different root causes—one is missing test documentation and the other is incomplete test implementations—so I'll keep them separate and skip the DocumentFix group since the fixes themselves serve as documentation. I need to follow the strategy more carefully—I should group related violations by their root cause rather than fixing them individually, so I'll organize them into logical fix groups now. them properly. I'll group all violations into one fix group since they're all about DealsListPage test completeness.\n\nActually no, the root causes are genuinely different:\n1. Missing test entries in tests.md → Need to add entries + write tests\n2. Existing tests not fully implementing spec entries → Need to update test code\n\nLet me create two groups:\n\nGroup 1:\nAdding commands to create a job group for missing DealsListPage test entries, including adding the entries themselves and verifying the tests pass.\n\nGroup 2:\nAdding commands to create a job group for fixing incomplete test implementations across three specific test cases, then running verification.\n\nI'm debating whether to include a DocumentFix job—the strategy example shows one, but for test fixes the test entries and code are already the documentation. I'll follow the pattern anyway since it can update any tracking docs.\n\nWait, I should double-check the DLP-FLT-06 test—it might actually be working correctly as-is. I'm verifying the test entry numbers—checking that DLP-HDR-06 doesn't already exist in the test file, and confirming there are no missing data-testid attributes on interactive elements that tests
