This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

The app is tracking the inventory held of a variety of categorized materials and is broadly similar to an accounting platform.  There is a global set of accounts (inventory, consumer, producer) which can be customized, and within each account there are a variety of materials and their quantity (in customizable units).  Each account / material can be further subdivided into batches where the amount of material in each batch is tracked separately.  Transactions can be recorded and use a double entry system where credits / debits must balance.  Transactions can either reuse batches or create new ones.  newly created batches remember the lineage of batches they were created from.\n\nPages:\n\n1.

[2026-02-26T16:21:55.273Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Ub2SJG4tcEDWPn5Hg6tK5B","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have the mockup and the test entries. Let me systematically check the testSpec.md directives against the TransactionsPage test entries.\n\n**Mockup Analysis:**\nThe mockup shows:\n- Navigation header: \"Acme Ledger\" logo, Dashboard, Transactions, Accounts, Reports links, Admin user avatar\n- Breadcrumb: \"Home / Transactions\"\n- \"New Transaction\" button (top right, blue/filled)\n- Filters section with \"Filters\" label and \"Clear Filters\" link\n  - Date Range filter with calendar icon: \"Oct 1, 2023 - Oct 31, 2023\"\n  - Involved Account(s): multi-select showing \"Raw Materials Inventory (1200), Accounts Payable (2100) (2 selected)\"\n  - Material: multi-select showing \"Steel Plates (M001), Plastic Pellets (M002) (2 selected)\"\n  - Transaction Type: dropdown showing \"All Types (Purchase, Consumption, Transfer...)\"\n- Search bar with magnifying glass icon and placeholder text\n- Sort dropdown defaulting to \"Date (Newest First)\"\n- Results count displaying \"Showing 1-10 of 145 results\"\n- Table with sortable Date column and additional columns below for Transaction ID, Description, Accounts affected, and Materials with amounts\n- Transaction rows populated with data and pagination controls at the bottom allowing navigation between pages with adjustable rows per page\n\nNow I'm noticing a discrepancy between the navigation structure in the mockup versus the test specifications. The mockup displays Dashboard, Transactions, Accounts, and Reports, but the test entries reference Accounts, Materials, Batches, Transactions, and Settings. Since the directive prioritizes consistent navigation and styling over exact image adherence, I'll go with the test specification structure.\n\nLooking at directive 2, I need to systematically account for every visible element in the mockup. I've covered the NavigationHeader, breadcrumb, page heading, the New Transaction button, filter controls, and the date range filter. Now I'm checking what else needs test coverage—the Involved Account filter appears to be next on the list. I've covered the rows per page dropdown and pagination ellipsis, so the test entries appear comprehensive against the mockup. Now I'm verifying that the directives are satisfied—the filters match what's shown with multi-select and proper notation, and every clickable element has its navigation target specified, from the New Transaction button through to individual transaction rows.\n\nFor data mutations, this page is primarily read-only with filtering and sorting, so that directive doesn't really apply here. The only persistence concern would be on the DashboardPage with alert dismissal, not here.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the button and control styling matches what the mockup specifies.  The \"New Transaction\" button is marked as primary/blue, the search bar has the magnifying glass icon, date filtering shows a calendar icon, and the sort dropdown displays the current sort order — all verified. There are no modal dialogs or attachment features on this page to test.\n\nLooking at the navigation structure, I notice the mockup shows \"Dashboard, Transactions, Accounts, Reports\" but the DashboardPage tests reference a different set of links like \"Materials, Batches, Settings\" — I should verify which navigation structure is actually correct for the TransactionsPage.\n\nI'm also catching an inconsistency in breadcrumb formatting: TransactionsPage uses \"/\" as a separator while TransactionDetailPage uses \">\", which feels like something I should address for consistency across the app, though it's a lower priority than the core functionality.\n\nLooking at the test entries more carefully, they seem to cover all the key elements from the mockup—the sort indicators on Date and Transaction ID columns are tested, along with the sorting behavior itself.

OK.\n\n**Directive 11: \"Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns\"**\nLet me check the filter components. All the filter components (AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, TransactionTypeFilter, DateRangeFilter) use custom dropdown components with React state, not native `<select>`. However, the DateRangeFilter uses native `<input type=\"date\">` elements - that's fine because the directive specifically talks about `<select>` elements for dropdowns and filters, not `<input>` elements.\n\nWait, let me re-read. \n\nThe directive clarifies it's about avoiding native `<select>` when there's a custom design system, and TransactionsPage filters all use custom dropdown buttons with React state instead. ✓\n\n**Directive 12: \"Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails\"** - No attachments on TransactionsPage. N/A.\n\n**Directive 13: \"Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads\"** - No attachments. N/A.\n\n**Directive 14: \"Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element\"** - Let me check the padding on the root element.\n\nLooking at TransactionsPage.tsx, both the loading state and main render have the correct padding classes applied. ✓\n\nNow I'm noticing a potential issue with the AccountFilter dropdown. The test spec expects account names to include their account numbers in the format \"Raw Materials Inventory (1200)\", but looking at AccountFilter.tsx, it's only displaying the account name without the number. I need to verify whether the account name already includes the number or if this is a mismatch with the requirements.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1299,"cache_read_input_tokens":75537,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1299,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d2f2a466-c0d4-46f4-98da-76bfaf439a9c","uuid":"cf2372d6-4ebf-44a0-955e-a1ccc8ffc0fc"}

The database schema has no `account_number` or `account_code` field in the accounts table. The Account type has only `name` (string). The test spec references account names with numbers like \"Raw Materials Inventory (1200)\", but those numbers seem to be part of the account name itself (i.e., the seeded account name already includes the number).\n\nThis is more of a test spec / seed data concern than a component-level violation. The AccountFilter component correctly shows `account.name`, and the name from the database would include the number if the account was created with it as part of the name. This is fine.\n\n\nThe same applies to MaterialFilter, which displays `material.name` — the material code like \"M001\" is embedded in the name itself. Moving on to check the writeApp.md directives: I don't see any native `<select>` elements in the TransactionsPage component, all filters use custom dropdown buttons. The root element has the required padding classes `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. Now I'm checking the remaining directives...\n\nLooking at what's actually rendered on the page, the Breadcrumb and individual filter components are properly abstracted, but the page header with the title and \"New Transaction\" button appears to be inline, as does the filters wrapper with its label and \"Clear Filters\" button. The test spec references a `TransactionsPageHeader` component, which suggests these should be extracted.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3337,"cache_read_input_tokens":87484,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3337,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d2f2a466-c0d4-46f4-98da-76bfaf439a9c","uuid":"cef2de82-099e-406f-9f0a-3c084b96ee58"}

TransactionsPage.tsx has its own inline button code (lines 177-196) instead of importing and using the `NewTransactionButton` component. This is a minor issue - there's a component that exists but is not used.\n\n2. `TransactionsPageHeader` does NOT exist as a separate component. The tests.md references it as a component, but the actual JSX for the page title and filters section are inline in TransactionsPage.tsx. \n\nThe writeApp.md directive requires all JSX on a page to be abstracted into separate components, and looking at TransactionsPage.tsx, the page header (lines 173-197) and the filters wrapper section (lines 199-237) violate this rule—they're inline JSX that should be extracted into their own components, though the individual filter components themselves are already properly abstracted.\n\nI'm noticing that the page has an inline button for creating new transactions, but there's already a `NewTransactionButton` component available that isn't being used—the button logic is duplicated directly in the page instead of importing and using the existing component.\n\nAdditionally, the tests reference a `TransactionsPageHeader` component that doesn't actually exist; the page title and filter controls are currently inlined in the main page file rather than extracted into their own component. Both of these are clear violations of the abstraction directive.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the `formatAccountsAffected` function properly displays account numbers alongside account names in the Dr/Cr notation format that the test spec requires...\n\nFormatting account display...

[2026-02-26T16:25:18.412Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_012xRkMeGwW4AANqNvGuZ1XZ","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the seeded account names:\n- 'Main Warehouse'\n- 'Secondary Warehouse'  \n- 'Receiving Dock'\n- 'Supplier Returns'\n- 'Production Floor'\n- 'Quality Hold'\n\nThese do NOT include account numbers like \"(1200)\" in their names. The test spec references account names with numbers like \"Raw Materials Inventory (1200)\", but the actual seed data uses completely different account names without numbers.\n\nHowever, this is a seed data vs test spec mismatch, not a writeApp.md directive violation per se. The seed data uses different account names than what the test spec describes. \n\nI'm noticing the test spec references conceptual accounting accounts like Raw Materials Inventory and Accounts Payable, while the implementation uses physical storage location names instead. This raises a question about whether the app code actually satisfies the test entry requirements as the directive specifies.\n\nThe core issue is that the test spec expects accounts to have numbers (like \"Raw Materials Inventory (1200)\"), but the Account type doesn't have an account_number field—it only has a name. So if the seeded test data doesn't match what the spec describes, I can't fulfill the test entry that requires displaying accounts with their IDs.\n\nFor the writeApp.md directive violations though, I should focus on the actual code problems rather than data alignment issues. I found that TransactionsPage.tsx inlines a \"New Transaction\" button instead of using the existing NewTransactionButton component, which violates the requirement that all JSX on a page must be abstracted into components.\n\nI also notice the docs reference a TransactionsPageHeader component that doesn't actually exist as a separate file—the page header and filters are currently inlined in the main page file. Looking more carefully at the directive, it's clear that the page should only be composing other components, not rendering JSX directly. I see that TransactionsPage is rendering a button inline instead of using the existing NewTransactionButton component, and TransactionsPageHeader is referenced in tests but doesn't exist as a separate component—both violations of the abstraction directive. I should flag these as a single fix task. Now I need to check whether any of the TransactionsPage components violate the layout-agnostic directive by including outer padding or margins on their root elements.\n\nLooking through the components—TransactionsSearchBar, TransactionsTable, TransactionsPagination, and the various filters all have clean root elements with no padding or margin applied, so that directive is satisfied. Next I need to verify the overflow handling across these components.\n\nChecking the dropdown containers in AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, TransactionTypeFilter, and DateRangeFilter—they all use `position: relative` on the root with no `overflow: hidden`, which means absolutely-positioned dropdowns can render properly without being clipped. The sort dropdown in TransactionsTable follows the same pattern, so that's good.\n\nNow I'm looking at the test comment directive from testSpec.md about adding comments next to interactive elements that reference which tests exercise them—I need to figure out if this applies to the component code itself or just the test specifications. I'm focused on checking writeApp.md directives for the TransactionsPage component, so the test spec comment requirement doesn't apply here. I notice the test spec expects account IDs in the AccountFilter dropdown (like \"Raw Materials Inventory (1200)\"), but the component only displays account names since there's no account_number field in the database schema—this is a test spec alignment issue rather than a component violation.\n\nNow I'm examining the `formatMaterialsAndAmounts` function more closely, since the test spec expects material codes like \"Steel Plates (M001)\" but the code only references `material_name`, and the Material type also lacks a code

The test spec references material codes like \"Steel Plates (M001)\", but neither the data model nor the database schema has material codes. The material name in the seed data is just \"Steel Sheet\", \"Aluminum Rod\", etc., without any codes.\n\nThis is a discrepancy between the test spec and the implementation, but again, the test spec uses example data to illustrate behavior patterns. The actual account/material names used in tests may differ from those in the test spec examples. The test entries use fictitious data to describe what the UI should look like; the actual tests will use whatever data exists in the test database.\n \nBut looking back at the writeApp.md directive about satisfying entry requirements, the test spec explicitly shows account numbers in the display format like \"Dr: Raw Materials Inventory (1200) | Cr: Accounts Payable (2100)\", which means the app needs to support displaying account codes—but the current data model doesn't include them at all.\n\nThe real issue is that the test entries describe format expectations (account codes in parentheses, account IDs in dropdowns) that the actual implementation can't fulfill because the underlying data model is fundamentally different. I need to figure out whether these format specifications are hard requirements the code must meet, or just illustrative examples that can vary based on the actual data structure.\n\nLooking at the test entry about the dropdown showing \"account names with their account numbers\" — if the seed data doesn't include account numbers at all, then this is a mismatch between what the test spec assumes and what the implementation provides. This feels more like a testSpec.md alignment problem than a writeApp.md violation, since the code can't satisfy a requirement that the data model doesn't support.\n\nLet me focus on identifying the actual, clear directive violations rather than getting caught up in this spec-versus-implementation gap.\n\nI've found two main issues: the TransactionsPage is rendering the New Transaction button inline instead of using the existing NewTransactionButton component, and the page header JSX is also inline when it should be abstracted into a separate TransactionsPageHeader component. Both violate the directive about abstracting JSX into dedicated components.\n\nNow I'm checking whether any domain-specific colors are hardcoded in the TransactionsPage components, but it looks like everything's using CSS variables properly.\n\nI'm also verifying the overflow and z-index directive by examining the filter dropdowns—they have position: relative on the container and absolutely-positioned menus, but I need to confirm whether the custom-dropdown-menu class actually defines explicit z-index values.","signature":"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

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component.\"**\nNot applicable to TransactionsPage tests - they only test the TransactionsPage. ✓\n\n**Directive**\n\n3: \"For actions that produce side effects, write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once.\"**\nTransactionsPage is a listing and filtering page without side effects. ✓\n\n**Directive 4: \"Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements.\"**\nScanning the test files shows no `getByText()` usage - all tests rely on `getByTestId()` or locators with data-testid selectors, plus class-based assertions. ✓\n\n**Directive 5: \"All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent.\"**\nChecking data-testid consistency across the three test files, starting with `transactions-table`...\n\nThe testids like `transactions-table`, `transaction-row-*`, `transactions-sort-dropdown`, and sort-related identifiers appear consistently across all three spec files, along with filter-specific and pagination-specific testids. Everything checks out. ✓\n\n**Directive 6: \"When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics.\"**\nTransactionsPage has no file upload functionality. ✓\n\n**Directive 7: \"NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside a `.toPass()` retry block.\"**\nNow checking for this pattern...\n\nno `.toPass()` blocks found anywhere. ✓\n\n**Directive 8: \"Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks.\"**\nNone of the test files use `beforeEach` hooks. ✓\n\n**Directive 9: \"For assertions that depend on backend round-trips, use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`).\"**\nInitial page loads have 30-second timeouts and filter assertions use 15-second timeouts, which are appropriately generous. ✓\n\n**Directive 10: \"For tests that chain multiple user flows, add `test.slow()`.\"**\nScanning for multi-step test sequences...\n\nMulti-step tests like date range filtering and clearing all filters properly have `test.slow()` marked, while simple single-action tests like column header displays correctly don't have it. ✓\n\n**Directive 11: \"When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field, the test must exercise that exact field.\"**\nThe TransactionsPage tests focus on display and filtering rather than field editing, so this directive doesn't apply here.\n\n**Directive 12: \"Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test.\"**\nNot applicable to TransactionsPage. ✓\n\n**Directive 13: \"Auth flows that involve email-based verification must have dedicated tests.\"**\nNot applicable. ✓\n\nNow I'm checking for potential issues with how the tests handle dynamic elements. In the transactions-table tests, I'm iterating over rows using count() in a few places, but those iterations aren't wrapped in `.toPass()` blocks, which is fine since the DOM should be stable after waiting for rows to load.\n\nI also notice the \"Materials and amounts column shows N/A\" test properly uses `test.slow()` to account for longer execution time. The iteration patterns throughout the file access auto-waiting calls like `.count()` and `.textContent()`, which could theoretically be problematic if the DOM changed mid-iteration, but since the tests wait for rows to be visible first, this approach is acceptable.\n\nNow I'm examining the transaction filter test more closely to see how it extracts row data during iteration.\n\nLooking at the parallel test design requirements, the TransactionsPage tests avoid hardcoding specific record counts and instead use relative assertions like checking if filtered results are less than the initial count, which aligns with the directive. ✓\n\nHowever, I notice some tests do make assumptions about pagination—like expecting page 2 to start at row 11 and page 3 at row 21—but these are valid since they're derived from the default 10 rows per page rather than arbitrary hardcoded values. ✓ The real concern is whether tests that navigate to specific pages assume enough records exist, though most handle this gracefully by either dynamically calculating the last page or working fine as long as the target page exists.\n\nNow I'm checking the sorting test for \"Date (Oldest First)\" - it's extracting dates from the visible transaction rows and verifying they're in ascending order. I'm double-checking the `getByText()` usage against the directive about avoiding ambiguous selectors. Looking through the tests, I don't see any violations—the codebase properly uses `getByTestId` for precise targeting and avoids the `.first()` workaround pattern that the guidelines warn against.
