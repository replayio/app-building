The webhook remains in the list unchanged.\n\n#### Webhook list shows event types for each webhook\n- **Initial state:** User is on /settings. A webhook exists configured to fire on \"New Client Created\" and \"Deal Stage Changed\" events.\n- **Expected:** The webhook entry displays the subscribed event types (e.g., as badges or a comma-separated list showing \"New Client Created\", \"Deal Stage Changed\") so the user can see at a glance what events trigger each webhook.\n\n### AddEditWebhookModal\n\n#### Modal displays name, URL, platform, and event fields\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open (via clicking \"Add Webhook\").\n- **Expected:** The modal contains: a Name text input field, a platform selection control with options for Zapier, n8n, and Custom, a URL text input field, and a set of event checkboxes for subscribing to events (e.g., \"New Client Created\", \"Deal Stage Changed\", \"Task Completed\", etc.). The modal has \"Cancel\" and \"Save\" (or \"Create\") buttons at the bottom.\n\n#### Platform selection shows Zapier setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Zapier\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A platform-specific setup guide is displayed with step-by-step instructions for obtaining the Zapier webhook URL. The guide explains where to find the webhook URL in Zapier (e.g., \"Create a new Zap, add 'Webhooks by Zapier' as the trigger, select 'Catch Hook', and copy the webhook URL\"). A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/...\"). A platform-specific tip is displayed explaining that Zapier needs the first event sent to detect the payload schema. The URL input placeholder updates to reflect the Zapier URL format.\n\n#### Platform selection shows n8n setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"n8n\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A platform-specific setup guide is displayed with step-by-step instructions for obtaining the n8n webhook URL. The guide explains where to find the webhook URL in n8n (e.g., \"Add a Webhook node to your workflow, copy the webhook URL from the node settings\"). A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...\"). A platform-specific tip is displayed explaining that n8n has separate test and production URLs and to use the production URL. The URL input placeholder updates to reflect the n8n URL format.\n\n#### Platform selection shows Custom endpoint setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Custom\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A setup guide is displayed with instructions for configuring a custom webhook endpoint. The guide explains that the endpoint must accept POST requests with a JSON payload. A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://your-server.com/webhook\"). The URL input placeholder updates to a generic webhook URL format.\n\n#### Payload format preview is toggleable\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with a platform selected.\n- **Action:** User clicks a toggle or expandable section to show the payload format preview.\n- **Expected:** A section expands or appears showing the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The preview displays example JSON with fields like event type, timestamp, and entity data. The user can toggle this section closed again to hide the preview.\n\n#### Event checkboxes allow selecting multiple events\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open. No events are selected.\n- **Action:** User checks the \"New Client Created\" and \"Deal Stage Changed\" event checkboxes.\n- **Expected:** Both checkboxes are visually checked. The user can check or uncheck any combination of event types independently. At least one event must be selected to save the webhook.\n\n#### Modal validates required fields\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with all fields empty.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Save\" button without filling in any fields.\n- **Expected:** Validation errors are displayed for required fields: Name is required, URL is required, and at least one event must be selected. The webhook is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### Modal validates URL format\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open. User has entered a name and selected events.\n- **Action:** User enters \"not-a-valid-url\" in the URL field and clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** A validation error is displayed indicating the URL is not valid (e.g., \"Please enter a valid URL\"). The webhook is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### Successfully creating a webhook adds it to the list\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User fills in Name = \"My Zapier Hook\", selects platform = \"Zapier\", enters URL = \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123/abc\", checks \"New Client Created\" and \"Task Completed\" events, and clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** The webhook is created via the CRUD API. The modal closes. The new webhook \"My Zapier Hook\" appears in the webhooks list with the URL displayed, an enabled toggle, and the selected event types shown.\n\n#### Successfully editing a webhook updates the list\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open in edit mode for a webhook named \"My Zapier Hook\" subscribed to \"New Client Created\" and \"Task Completed\".\n- **Action:** User changes the name to \"Updated Zapier Hook\" and additionally checks the \"Deal Stage Changed\" event. User clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** The webhook is updated via the API. The modal closes. The webhook list shows the updated name \"Updated Zapier Hook\" and now displays three subscribed events: \"New Client Created\", \"Task Completed\", and \"Deal Stage Changed\".\n\n#### Cancel button closes modal without saving\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with some fields filled in.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No webhook is created or updated. The webhooks list remains unchanged.\n\n#### Modal closes on overlay click without saving\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the modal overlay (area outside the modal dialog).\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No webhook is created or updated.\n\n#### URL placeholder updates based on selected platform\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with no platform selected.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Zapier\", then \"n8n\", then \"Custom\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** When \"Zapier\" is selected, the URL input placeholder shows a Zapier-style URL hint (e.g., \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/...\"). When \"n8n\" is selected, the placeholder changes to an n8n-style URL hint (e.g., \"https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...\"). When \"Custom\" is selected, the placeholder changes to a generic URL hint (e.g., \"https://your-server.com/webhook\").\n\n## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n\n## UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n\n## ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n\n## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n","numLines":843,"startLine":1,"totalLines":843}}}

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test.

Let me summarize what I've found:\n\n**UsersListPage status:**\n- The tests.md has an empty section `## UsersListPage - Team (/users)` (line 834) with no components or test entries\n- The actual page component is a stub (just a div with heading \"Team\")\n- The AppRevisions.md describes what UsersListPage should have: grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count\n- There's a usersSlice.ts with fetchUsers/fetchUser thunks\n- There's NO users Netlify function (the backend is missing)\n\n\n- There are also no Playwright tests for UsersListPage\n\nUserDetailPage has the same issues: empty test section, stub component, missing backend, and no tests. The AppRevisions.md spec calls for user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed.\n\nBoth pages are essentially unimplemented stubs with no test coverage and no backend support. Now I need to work through the validation jobs systematically, starting with what the testSpec.md directives actually require.\n\nThe test spec rules are clear: test entries must align with the app spec, follow behavior-driven development, have titles, be grouped by page, indicate components, and comprehensively test every interactive element. For UsersListPage specifically, the AppRevisions.md spec describes a grid of user cards showing avatar, name, email, deal counts, and task counts—with clicking a card navigating to UserDetailPage at /users. But the tests.md file has nothing for this page, which violates the requirement to test all features.\n\nNow I'm checking the component implementation against the writeApp.md directives. The UsersListPage component is just a stub with a heading, but it should render a grid of user cards with all the fields from the spec. The component also needs proper styling with consistent padding, data-testid attributes for testing, and abstraction into smaller components. Additionally, the backend users function hasn't been implemented yet, which is blocking the component from fetching the data it needs.\n\nSince the test spec is empty and the component doesn't exist, these violations all stem from the same issue: UsersListPage hasn't been built. I need to prioritize fixing the test spec first by adding entries for both UsersListPage and UserDetailPage, then build out the actual components. about writing tests for all test entries.\n\nThese violations are interconnected—the root issue is that UsersListPage and UserDetailPage haven't been fully implemented yet despite being in AppRevisions.md. I should organize the fixes into logical stages: first the test spec documentation, then the actual components, then the Playwright tests. Since they share the same underlying cause, I could bundle related violations together, but I need to be careful about the order—test specs should be defined before building components, which should come before writing tests.\n\nLooking at how the strategy handles violations, I see the pattern uses `add-group` to create fix groups with multiple related jobs, but these tasks are substantial enough that they might align better with the build strategies rather than just the checkDirectives approach.\n\nSo my approach is to report all the violations I'm finding, then create fix groups that make sense for them. The UsersListPage is completely empty—both the test spec and implementation are stubs—which means there are multiple violations across both files: the test spec lacks any component inventory or test entries for the elements that should exist (user cards, avatars, names, emails, deal counts, task counts), and the implementation is just a placeholder heading with no actual users function despite the slice expecting it.\n\nI'm organizing the fixes into a dependency pipeline: first write the test spec entries, then build out the actual page with backend and frontend, then write the Playwright tests. I notice UserDetailPage is referenced from UsersListPage, but since the job only asks about UsersListPage, I'll focus there. is that all these violations stem from the same missing page implementation, so maybe I should consolidate them into one larger fix group that handles the spec, components, and tests together rather than splitting them across three separate groups. is that UsersListPage hasn't been built out. So maybe I should create fewer, more consolidated groups.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The violations span three strategy documents, but they're all about the same thing: UsersListPage is unimplemented. Let me create fix groups that follow the natural build order:\n\n1. First: Fix test spec (must come first because components reference test entries)\n2. Second: Fix components + backend\n3. Third: Fix tests\n\nLet me go with that approach.\n\nActually wait - the UserDetailPage is also a stub and also has empty test spec. But I was only asked to check UsersListPage. Should I include UserDetailPage violations? The UserDetailPage has its own section in tests.md that would be checked separately. But it looks like there might be a separate check group for UserDetailPage.
