Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5751dfd1-cb12-4428-bf5f-03d574b20d4f","uuid":"17c1a173-aec8-4c06-9a06-a59c6fb4b970","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

Let me also look at the mockup for the TasksListPage.\n\nLooking at the existing code, all components are already written and functional:\n\n1. **TasksHeader.tsx** - Already has:\n   - \"Upcoming Tasks\" heading\n   - New Task button with Plus icon\n   - Success message toast\n   - TaskFormModal integration\n   - data-testid attributes\n\n2. **TasksFilter.tsx** - Already has:\n   - Filter type dropdown (All Fields, Priority, Assignee, Client, Due Date)\n   - Text filter input with placeholder \"Filter...\"\n   - Clear button\n   - Debounced filter text\n   - data-testid attributes\n\n3. **TasksList.tsx** - Already has:\n   - Task cards with priority badges, task names, due dates, assignees\n   - Action menu (View Details, Edit, Mark as Complete, Delete)\n   - Delete confirmation modal\n   - Edit modal\n   - Filter logic\n   - Empty states for loading, no tasks, and no filter results\n   - data-testid attributes\n\n4. **TasksListPage.tsx** - Already has:\n   - Fetches tasks on mount\n   - Renders TasksHeader, TasksFilter, TasksList\n   - Proper state management and data flow\n\nNow I'm checking the mockup against the actual layout to make sure everything visually aligns, then cross-referencing with the test requirements to verify all the functionality is covered. Looking through the TasksHeader tests first—the page title, primary button styling, modal opening, form validation, task creation, and cancellation all appear to be implemented.\n\nContinuing through the TasksFilter tests, I can see the dropdown with filter icons, the category options, the text input with placeholder, and the filtering logic for each category like Priority, Assignee, Client, and Due Date.\n\nNow looking at the TasksList tests, I'm verifying that task cards show all the necessary elements—priority badges with color coding, bold task names, relative and absolute date formatting, and the action menu for each task. I'm realizing I need to double-check the actual requirements—the jobs list four components that should be written, but looking at the codebase, they all seem to already exist and are fully implemented. Let me examine the mockup to see if there's something missing or broken in the current

Let me compare it with the existing code:\n\n**Mockup analysis:**\n- Header: \"Upcoming Tasks\" on the left, blue \"New Task\" button on the right\n- Filter: Filter icon with dropdown chevron on the left, \"Filter...\" text input spanning the rest of the width\n- Task cards: Each card has:\n  - Color-coded priority badge (High=red, Medium=yellow/amber, Low=green, Normal=gray/blue)\n  - Task name in bold\n  - Due date text (e.g., \"Due: Today, 5:00 PM\")\n  - Assignee avatar (circular photo) with abbreviated name and role\n  - \"...\" action menu button\n- Cards are in a bordered list with dividers between them\n\nComparing against the existing implementation, the TasksHeader looks correct with the heading and button. For the TasksFilter, the mockup shows the filter trigger on the left with a wide text input spanning most of the width, but the current code constrains the input to 320px max-width, which seems too narrow based on the design. Looking at the mockup more carefully, the filter dropdown and input appear to share a unified border as a single connected bar that spans the full width, whereas the current implementation separates them with a gap. The `max-width: 320px` constraint on the input wrapper also needs to be removed to allow it to take up the remaining space properly. Looking at the mockup more carefully, the filter input should span the full width instead of being capped at 320px, and the filter icon and input should appear as a unified bar rather than separate elements. Let me adjust the styling and component structure to match that design while keeping the existing functionality intact. Looking at the existing implementations more carefully, I notice the filter input has a max-width constraint that doesn't match the mockup—it should span the full width instead. Also, the filter dropdown and input should appear as a unified bar rather than separate elements.\n\nLet me also verify the test requirements are properly covered, particularly around the \"View Details\" action which correctly checks for a client_id before displaying since it navigates to the client detail page.\n\nNow I need to check the visual details against the mockup more carefully. The filter bar should be a single bordered container spanning the full width with the filter icon and chevron on the left, and the input field taking up the remaining space. Let me review the current styling...\n\nStill writing styles... Adjusting the filter styling to match the mockup — I need to remove the width constraint and unify the dropdown trigger and input into a single bordered container that spans the full width, since the mockup shows them as one cohesive bar rather than separate elements. I need to verify the tests will still pass with the unified bar structure—the dropdown trigger, input, and clear button all need to remain functional. Since the core behavior doesn't change, just the styling, I can proceed with wrapping everything in a single bordered container and removing the individual borders. I'm checking if the `.tasks-filter` styles are used anywhere else in the codebase, and it looks like they're isolated to this component, so I can safely update them without affecting other parts of the app.\n\nWriting the updated styles... Still writing filter styles... Still writing styles... Still writing styles...\n\nNow I'm thinking through how the dropdown positioning will work with the relative positioning on the filter wrapper—that should keep everything aligned properly. Let me finalize these changes and move
