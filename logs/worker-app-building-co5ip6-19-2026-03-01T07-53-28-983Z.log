It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- Apps that receive webhooks from external services must include a webhook help/documentation UI\n    67→  accessible from the app's status or admin page. The help UI must list each webhook endpoint with its\n    68→  URL path, HTTP method, authentication requirements (e.g., Bearer token, query parameter), required\n    69→  and optional payload fields, and an example curl command. Example curl commands must use the actual\n    70→  deployed site URL (derived from the current page origin) rather than placeholder values — commands\n    71→  should be ready to use as-is. Each curl command and endpoint URL should have a copy-to-clipboard\n    72→  button so users can quickly use them. Test entries should verify that the help UI is accessible via a\n    73→  clearly labeled button, displays accurate documentation for each webhook endpoint, uses the actual\n    74→  site URL in examples, and provides working copy buttons.\n    75→\n    76→- For apps that expose backend API endpoints (webhooks, serverless functions, etc.), the test specification\n    77→  must include entries that verify the endpoints actually function correctly — not just that their\n    78→  documentation or help UI is accurate. Test entries should cover calling each endpoint with valid inputs\n    79→  and verifying the expected side effects (e.g., database records created or updated, status transitions\n    80→  completed, downstream processes triggered).\n    81→\n    82→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    83→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    84→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    85→\n    86→## Tips\n    87→\n    88→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    89→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    90→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    91→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    92→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    93→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    94→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    95→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    96→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- Apps that receive webhooks from external services must include a webhook help/documentation UI\n  accessible from the app's status or admin page. The help UI must list each webhook endpoint with its\n  URL path, HTTP method, authentication requirements (e.g., Bearer token, query parameter), required\n  and optional payload fields, and an example curl command. Example curl commands must use the actual\n  deployed site URL (derived from the current page origin) rather than placeholder values — commands\n  should be ready to use as-is. Each curl command and endpoint URL should have a copy-to-clipboard\n  button so users can quickly use them. Test entries should verify that the help UI is accessible via a\n  clearly labeled button, displays accurate documentation for each webhook endpoint, uses the actual\n  site URL in examples, and provides working copy buttons.\n\n- For apps that expose backend API endpoints (webhooks, serverless functions, etc.), the test specification\n  must include entries that verify the endpoints actually function correctly — not just that their\n  documentation or help UI is accurate. Test entries should cover calling each endpoint with valid inputs\n  and verifying the expected side effects (e.g., database records created or updated, status transitions\n  completed, downstream processes triggered).\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":98,"startLine":1,"totalLines":98}}}

This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":164,"startLine":1,"totalLines":164}}}

The components are: StatusFilter, RequestAppCTA, AppCard, AppCardGrid.\n\nLet me review each directive against the MainPage test entries:\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n\n2. I need to systematically catalog every visible element in each mockup—columns, filters, buttons, icons, badges, sections—and write a test for each one, since it's easy to overlook minor elements or focus only on prominent features.\n3. I shouldn't swap in simpler elements for what the mockup actually shows; if a table needs computed columns or joins, I test all of them, and if there are four filters, I test all four rather than just the easiest ones.\n4. For every clickable element, the test must specify exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers, not leaving this vague.\n5. For buttons that open external flows like OAuth or payments, I need to specify how they open (popup, redirect, etc.) and what happens when complete.\n6. Any user action that changes data requires test entries confirming the change persists and the correct side effects occur.\n7. Button and control appearance matters—if the mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that exact appearance, not just that a button exists.\n8. Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they work properly.\n9. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n10. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format.\n11. Configurable backend integrations need complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n12. Apps receiving webhooks from external services need webhook help documentation.\n13. For apps exposing backend API endpoints, tests must verify the endpoints actually function.\n14. State-changing actions need tests confirming that other parts of the app update appropriately when performed.\n\nNow I'm going through the MainPage test entries systematically—StatusFilter has 5 entries, RequestAppCTA has 3, AppCard has 7, and AppCardGrid has 5. I should also check the AppSpec for any mockup images that might inform what I'm testing.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":20972,"cache_read_input_tokens":27447,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":20972,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b48417bb-adbe-4b94-aaca-aa38163206c2","uuid":"090bd6c9-453c-44ee-92c4-1df6f22378a5"}

Let me systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecMainPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in MainPage test entries\n\nI need to check the MainPage section of docs/tests.md (lines 1-125) against the testSpec.md directives.\n\nLet me go through each directive:\n\n**Directive 1**: Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n- This is about styling consistency. Not directly a test spec entry issue. ✅ OK\n  \n**Directive 2**: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n- The MainPage contains a StatusFilter with three tabs, a RequestAppCTA button, AppCard components with title, description, progress bar, status text, View App button, and route path, plus an AppCardGrid in a two-column layout. The test entries appear to cover the filter tabs, CTA button, individual card elements, and grid structure, though I'd need to verify against the actual mockup image to confirm nothing's been missed.\n- Looking at the MainPage code, there's a System Status link in the footer that routes to /status, but this doesn't have a corresponding test entry in the spec. The component list only mentions StatusFilter, RequestAppCTA, AppCard, and AppCardGrid, so the footer link appears to be undocumented.\n\nThe directive is clear: I need to inventory every visible element and write a test entry for each one. Since the System Status link is actually rendered in the app, it should have a test entry even though it wasn't in the original spec.\n\nFor the segmented control, the implementation matches the spec description, so that's good. And for clickable elements, I need to verify that each test entry specifies exactly what happens when clicked — the StatusFilter tabs and RequestAppCTA both do this, but I should check the AppCard's View App button to make sure it has the same level of specificity. modals on MainPage. ✅\n\nDirectives 8-12 covering attachments, imports, backend integrations, webhooks, and API endpoints don't apply here. ✅\n\nThere are no state-changing actions on MainPage, so that directive is satisfied. ✅\n\nThe key gap I'm finding is that the MainPage code includes a System Status footer link pointing to /status, but there's no corresponding test entry for it in the test documentation. The AppSpec doesn't mention this link, so I need to determine whether it's actually part of the mockup or was added to the code separately.\n\nGiven the directive to systematically inventory every visible element, and since the code contains this clickable link, I should flag it as a missing test entry. Even though StatusPage has its own BackLink tests, the directive requires that each clickable element have a specific test entry documenting its navigation target or action result. The MainPage test entries don't cover this System Status link, which is a violation.\n\nNow moving to check the writeApp.md directives for MainPage components. I'm going through the writeApp.md directives to verify the MainPage component meets all requirements, checking that it has the proper data-testid attributes and other specifications like the status link. -link\"`. ✅\n- Root div has class \"main-page\" — I need to check if it has padding. Let me check the CSS.\n\n**StatusFilter.tsx**:\n- `data-testid=\"status-filter\"` on container. ✅\n- `data-testid=\"status-filter-tab-${tab.value}\"` on each tab button. ✅\n- Uses button elements, not native `<select>`. ✅ (Directive 11)\n- No issues seen.\n\n**RequestAppCTA.tsx**:\n- `data-testid=\"request-app-cta\"` on button. ✅\n- Simple navigation component. No issues.\n\n**AppCard.tsx**:\n- `data-testid=\"app-card\"` on root div. ✅\n- Progress track, status text, title, description, view button, and route text all have their respective testids. ✅\n- All interactive elements are properly labeled.\n\n**AppCardGrid.tsx**:\n- `data-testid=\"app-card-grid\"` on container. ✅\n- `data-testid=\"app-card-grid-empty\"` on empty state. ✅\n\nNow I need to verify

Let me work through them one by one.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecMainPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in MainPage test entries\n\nGoing through each testSpec.md directive against the MainPage section of docs/tests.md:\n\n**Directive 1**: Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n- This is about overall consistency, not specific test entries. N/A for entry-level check.\n  \n**Directive 2**: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n- Reviewing the MainPage components, I'm checking that StatusFilter has adequate coverage with entries for default state, tab switching, filter persistence, and empty states. RequestAppCTA is covered for visibility and navigation behavior. AppCard has comprehensive entries spanning title and description display, progress indicators for each status type, button navigation, route information, and styling variations.\n- AppCardGrid is covered with entries for the 2-column layout, filtering behavior, empty states, dynamic updates, and responsive behavior.\n- I'm noticing a gap: the MainPage includes a \"System Status\" footer link that navigates to `/status`, but there's no corresponding test entry for this clickable element. While it's embedded directly in MainPage rather than as a separate component, the directive requires testing every visible element, so this needs to be addressed.\n\nStatusFilter correctly implements the segmented control pattern with button-based tabs, and AppCardGrid uses CSS grid as specified—no substitutions there. For clickable elements, the test entries properly document navigation targets: StatusFilter tabs show which apps appear after filtering, RequestAppCTA goes to `/request`, and AppCard's View App button goes to `/apps/inventory-management`. The System Status link is the missing piece here—it needs a test entry specifying its navigation to `/status`.\n\nStyling is accounted for across all interactive components: the active StatusFilter tab has a blue highlight, RequestAppCTA displays a full-width blue gradient button, and AppCard's View App button is blue with rounded corners and white text. MainPage doesn't include modals or data mutations, so those directives don't apply. Moving on to check state-changing operations...\n\nMainPage only handles navigation and filtering without modifying data, so that requirement is satisfied. I'm noticing the System Status link in the footer isn't explicitly tested, but it's not part of the original AppSpec either—that spec only calls for the app selector, request CTA, and app cards. The StatusPage has its own BackLink test covering the reverse navigation, though the forward link from MainPage to StatusPage isn't directly tested. I need to determine if this gap actually violates the directive about inventorying every visible element. The System Status link is a clickable element without a test entry, which technically violates Directive 4, but I'll mark it as low priority since it might be an ancillary addition. Scanning through the other test entries, they all have proper titles, page groupings, and component indicators, so this subtask looks solid.\n\nNow I'm checking whether each MainPage component satisfies its corresponding test entry requirements from the spec. StatusFilter has the three tabs and default state working correctly, RequestAppCTA has the button with proper navigation, and I'm verifying AppCard next. I've verified that all components have the necessary `data-testid` attributes for E2E testing—from the main page and filters down to individual card elements and their interactive parts. Now I need to configure the base path for the monorepo setup in the vite config. to `netlify.toml`.\n- netlify.toml has `base = \"apps/LoopBuilder\"`. ✅\n- webServer in playwright.config has `--functions ./netlify/functions`. ✅\n\n**Directive**: When using the neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax.\n- MainPage components don't use database directly (they use Redux/fetch). N/A.\n\n**Directive**: For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, convert empty strings to null.\n- N/A for frontend components.\n\n**Directive**: Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at path index 2.\n- N/A for frontend components.\n\n**Directive**: When building modals that reference other entities, use a searchable select/dropdown.\n- No modals in MainPage. \n\nNow checking the remaining directives: navigation sidebars shouldn't have duplicate links (MainPage's single System Status link is fine), filter controls use buttons instead of native selects, and attachment features don't apply here. The root element padding needs to be `p-6 max-sm:p-3`, which MainPage.css currently sets to 24px. checks `toHaveURL(/\\/request/)` and `getByTestId('request-page').toBeVisible()` for the RequestAppCTA navigation, while the AppCard test verifies `toHaveURL(/\\/apps\\/inventory-management/)` and `getByTestId('app-page').toBeVisible()` — both properly asserting the exact navigation targets. The remaining directives don't apply to MainPage since there's no cross-page component testing or side-effect-producing actions to verify.\n\nLooking at the test quality checks: the tests consistently use `getByTestId` for precise targeting rather than ambiguous text selectors, the testid values are consistent across files, and there's no file upload functionality to exercise here. Everything aligns with the testing standards.\n\nChecking the remaining directives: there are no `.toPass()` retry blocks wrapping locator calls, no unnecessary state cleanup in hooks since tests handle their own setup through route mocking, and the 10-second timeouts are appropriate even for mocked routes given the Replay browser overhead. The rest of the auth verification directive doesn't apply here, and I'm running through the parallel test design checklist—mocked routes with explicit data, no hardcoded IDs, proper Playwright config with full parallelization and appropriate timeouts. Everything checks out across all three subtasks with no violations found.\n\nActually, I'm catching something I missed: the System Status footer link is a clickable element that should have a test entry according to the spec, but it's not listed in the components section or documented in tests.md. That's technically a violation of the requirement that every clickable element needs a test entry specifying its navigation target. it significant enough to create a fix task? Let me re-read the checkDirectives skill:\n\n\"For any violations you find, add a fix task using `add-task`. Do not fix them immediately.\"\n\nSo I should create a fix task for this. Let me do that.\n\nActually, I want to be more careful here. The link in MainPage.tsx goes to `/status`, and there IS a StatusPage already—it's just a navigation element. But the testSpec.md directives are clear: every clickable element needs a test entry specifying its navigation target or action result. The System Status link exists in the code but wasn't in the original mockup or spec, so it's missing a test entry. I should create a fix task for this. I need to verify whether the System Status link has test coverage. Looking at the test file, there's no test for it, and there's no entry in the test spec either. So I have a gap across both the test spec and the actual tests—a clickable element exists in the code without corresponding test coverage. Since I'm checking subtasks separately, this violation belongs to the testSpec subtask where the entry should have been documented. test entry for System Status link\n- Subtask 2 (writeApp components): No issues\n- Subtask 3 (writeTests): Missing test for System Status link (but this depends on the test entry existing first)\n\nSo the root issue is in testSpec - a missing test entry. Once that's fixed, a test should be written too.\n\nLet me create a fix task. The format is:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\" --app \"LoopBuilder\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixViolation: Fix <violation description>\" \\\n  --subtask \"RunTests: Verify tests pass after fix\" \\\n  --subtask \"DocumentFix: Document the fix\"\n```\n\nActually, is this really a meaningful violation? The System Status link is a tiny footer link.\n\nEven though it's a minor element, the directive is explicit about requiring test entries for all clickable elements and their navigation targets. Extra features like this footer link still need to follow the same rules, so I should create a fix task for this

Prefer `getByTestId`.**\n- All tests use `getByTestId` for element selection. ✅\n- Uses `toContainText` on testid-targeted elements (not ambiguous `getByText`). ✅\n- Uses `.filter({ hasText: ... })` for precise card filtering within testid-targeted locators. ✅\n\n**Directive: All `data-testid` values must be consistent across test files.**\n- `main-page.spec.ts` uses: `status-filter`, `status-filter-tab-building/finished/queued`, `request-app-cta`, `app-card`, `app-card-grid`, `app-card-grid-empty`, `app-card-title`, `app-card-description`, `app-card-progress`, `app-card-status`, `app-card-view-btn`, `app-card-route`, `main-page-loading`, `request-page`, `app-page`. All match the component source code. ✅\n\n**Directive: NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside a `.toPass()` retry block.**\n- No `.toPass()` blocks in the test file. ✅\n\n**Directive: Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks.**\n- No `beforeEach` hooks. Each test sets up its own mocked routes fresh. ✅\n\n**Directive: For assertions that depend on backend round-trips, use generous timeouts.**\n- Tests use `{ timeout: 10000 }` for initial visibility/count assertions. Routes are mocked so round-trips are instant, but the timeout accounts for Replay browser overhead. ✅\n\n**Directive: For tests that chain multiple user flows, add `test.slow()`.**\n- No multi-flow chaining tests. ✅\n\n**Directive: When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field, the test must exercise that exact field.**\n- N/A (no field editing on MainPage). ✅\n\n**Parallel Test Design directives:**\n- Tests don't rely on fixed database counts — they use mocked routes with explicit data. ✅\n- Tests create their own mock data via `setupMockApps`. ✅\n- No hardcoded database IDs. ✅\n- Playwright config: `fullyParallel: true`. ✅\n- Uses `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. ✅\n- Global timeout: 60_000ms. ✅\n- webServer timeout: 180_000ms. ✅\n\n**Missing test for System Status link:** There is no test for the \"System Status\" footer link in `main-page.spec.ts`. This corresponds to the missing test entry found in Subtask 1. Since there's no test entry in docs/tests.md, there's no test — this is a downstream effect of the testSpec violation.\n\nNo additional writeTests.md-specific violations found. ✅"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":992,"cache_read_input_tokens":77003,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":992,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b48417bb-adbe-4b94-aaca-aa38163206c2","uuid":"92e26fe5-50cb-49ce-a292-89b8f6f9491a"}
