This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n\n4. For every clickable element, specify the exact navigation target or action result without ambiguity.\n5. For any user action that mutates data, verify the change persists correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur.\n6. Button and control appearance matters — if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test entry should verify that appearance.\n7. Modal dialogs need to be completely tested for proper functionality.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format.\n10. Backend integrations that are cut off here need to be examined in the full directive.\n11. State-changing actions must have tests verifying that other parts of the app update appropriately when performed.\n\nNow I'm looking at the writeApp.md directives that cover implementation specifics like running npm checks, matching visual appearance to mockups, adding data-testid attributes to interactive elements, configuring netlify.toml for monorepos, using tagged template literals with the neon serverless driver, handling empty strings as null for date and timestamp columns, and how to access Netlify Functions.\n\nI also need to ensure modals use searchable select components when referencing other entities, avoid duplicate navigation links, never use native HTML select elements for filters, display file-type-specific icons for attachments, support actual file uploads, and apply consistent padding to page components.\n\nFor the writeTests.md directives, I'm noting that tests should verify navigation targets precisely, check that components available across multiple pages are tested on each page, and for side effects, verify both the primary effect and any secondary consequences.\n\nNow looking at the additional test directives: I need to avoid common substrings in getByText queries, keep data-testid values consistent across test files, exercise actual file upload mechanics when testing that functionality, never put Playwright locators with auto-wait inside retry blocks, skip unnecessary state cleanup, use generous timeouts for backend-dependent assertions, add test.slow() for multi-step user flows, reference skill files at the correct path, match data-testid values to actual component markup in deployment tests, and ensure tests interact with specific fields when the spec describes editing them.\n\nNow I'm moving into the verification work: I need to systematically check the DashboardPage test entries from docs/tests.md against the testSpec.md directives, then validate the actual component code against writeApp.md requirements, and finally audit the test code itself against writeTests.md guidelines.","signature":"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
