This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.

`${testId}-option-all` : `${testId}-option-${value}`;\n  await page.getByTestId(optionId).click();\n}\n```\n\n### Key Test Patterns\n\n1. **For \"All\" options:** Use `${testId}-option-all`\n2. **For specific values:** Use `${testId}-option-${value}` (e.g., `deals-filter-stage-option-proposal`)\n3. **For searchable selects:** Use `${testId}-search` to interact with the search input\n4. **Getting menu options:** `page.getByTestId('${testId}-menu').locator('button')`\n\n### All 26 Files Containing FilterSelect\n\n1. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/FilterSelect.tsx` (component definition)\n2. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsFilterControls.tsx`\n3. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/CreateDealModal.tsx`\n4. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/clients/ClientsFilterControls.tsx`\n5. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/clients/AddClientModal.tsx`\n6. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/ClientHeader.tsx`\n7. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddDealModal.tsx`\n8. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddTaskModal.tsx`\n9. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddAttachmentModal.tsx`\n10. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/DealDetailHeader.tsx`\n11. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/AddDealTaskModal.tsx`\n12. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/TasksFilterBar.tsx`\n13. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/CreateTaskModal.tsx`\n14. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/EditTaskModal.tsx`\n15. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/AddRelationshipModal.tsx`\n16. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/AddContactHistoryModal.tsx`\n17. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/EditContactHistoryModal.tsx`\n18. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deals-list-page.spec.ts`\n19. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`\n20. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/person-detail-page.spec.ts`\n21. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/client-detail-page.spec.ts`\n22. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deal-detail-page.spec.ts`\n23. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/AppRevisions.md`\n24. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md`\n25. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md`\n26. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a011095 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 51488\ntool_uses: 9\nduration_ms: 23059</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bf57df49-a74c-4e6d-8d6f-9f3fd3d55c3f","uuid":"07a8d587-acd9-4deb-9a7d-69403a53db7d","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Find all files that contain \"FilterSelect\" in the SalesCRM app. Search in /repo/apps/SalesCRM/.

`${testId}-option-all` : `${testId}-option-${value}`;\n  await page.getByTestId(optionId).click();\n}\n```\n\n### Key Test Patterns\n\n1. **For \"All\" options:** Use `${testId}-option-all`\n2. **For specific values:** Use `${testId}-option-${value}` (e.g., `deals-filter-stage-option-proposal`)\n3. **For searchable selects:** Use `${testId}-search` to interact with the search input\n4. **Getting menu options:** `page.getByTestId('${testId}-menu').locator('button')`\n\n### All 26 Files Containing FilterSelect\n\n1. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/FilterSelect.tsx` (component definition)\n2. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsFilterControls.tsx`\n3. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/CreateDealModal.tsx`\n4. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/clients/ClientsFilterControls.tsx`\n5. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/clients/AddClientModal.tsx`\n6. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/ClientHeader.tsx`\n7. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddDealModal.tsx`\n8. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddTaskModal.tsx`\n9. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddAttachmentModal.tsx`\n10. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/DealDetailHeader.tsx`\n11. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/AddDealTaskModal.tsx`\n12. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/TasksFilterBar.tsx`\n13. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/CreateTaskModal.tsx`\n14. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/EditTaskModal.tsx`\n15. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/AddRelationshipModal.tsx`\n16. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/AddContactHistoryModal.tsx`\n17. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/EditContactHistoryModal.tsx`\n18. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deals-list-page.spec.ts`\n19. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`\n20. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/person-detail-page.spec.ts`\n21. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/client-detail-page.spec.ts`\n22. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deal-detail-page.spec.ts`\n23. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/AppRevisions.md`\n24. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md`\n25. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/plan.md`\n26. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md`"}],"totalDurationMs":23059,"totalTokens":51488,"totalToolUseCount":9,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4766,"cache_read_input_tokens":44685,"output_tokens":2031,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4766},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}
