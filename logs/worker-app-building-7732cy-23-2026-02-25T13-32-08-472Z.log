Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n**1. TransactionHeaderFields** (`src/components/TransactionHeaderFields.tsx`):\n- Date input, Description input, and Currency dropdown in a single horizontal row\n- Currency uses SearchableSelect with USD/EUR/GBP/JPY options\n- Description field takes the most horizontal space (flex: 2)\n- Proper test IDs: `transaction-date`, `transaction-description`, `transaction-currency`\n\n**2. LineItemsTable** (`src/components/LineItemsTable.tsx`):\n- Section heading \"Transaction Details (Line Items)\"\n- Column headers: Account, Type, Amount, plus delete button column\n- Account dropdown shows accounts with codes (e.g., \"Checking Account (1010)\") with \"Select Account\" placeholder\n- Type is now a proper SearchableSelect dropdown with \"Debit\"/\"Credit\" options (was a toggle)\n- Add Line Item button, delete buttons, initial 2 empty rows\n- All required test IDs\n\n**3. BalanceIndicator** (`src/components/BalanceIndicator.tsx`):\n- Shows \"Total Debits\" and \"Total Credits\" with formatted currency amounts\n- Displays \"Transaction is Balanced\" (green checkmark) or \"Transaction is Unbalanced\" (red X)\n- Test IDs: `balance-indicator`, `total-debits`, `total-credits`, `balance-status`\n\n**4. TagsInput** (`src/components/TagsInput.tsx`):\n- Label \"Tags / Categories (optional)\" with muted optional indicator\n- Tag chips with × remove buttons\n- Supports Enter and comma key to add tags\n- Prevents duplicate tags\n\n**5. NewTransactionModal** (`src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`):\n- Composed from all 4 sub-components\n- Supports edit mode via optional `editTransaction` prop (pre-populates all fields)\n- Creates or updates transactions via Redux thunks\n- Added `updateTransaction` thunk to `transactionsSlice.ts`\n- Balance validation prevents saving unbalanced transactions\n\n**CSS updates** in `index.css`: Added `.transaction-header-fields` row layout, `.line-items-section-heading`, `.form-label-optional` styles.\n\nType check and lint pass cleanly.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 402626ms | Turns: 42 | Cost: $2.3694\nCost: $2.3694 (total: $158.0731)\nTurns: 42\nTask signaled <DONE>.

I still need to read logs 106 and 107. Let me also start writing the analysis files for the logs I've already read. Let me read the remaining 2 logs and start writing analysis files.\n\nLet me summarize what I found in each log:\n\n**Log 1** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-1-2026-02-25T12-07-04-352Z.log): Idle worker, no tasks, no shell commands.\n\n\n**Log 10** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-10-2026-02-24T19-59-05-908Z.log): Unpack task for writeScript skill that added deployment and test script tasks to the queue via a command-line tool.\n**Log 100** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-100-2026-02-25T05-38-35-566Z.log): testSpec task for the Accounting app's PlanPage/PlanComponent. I'm checking the tasks and apps directories, searching for revision files in the Accounting app, and downloading a mockup image for the report details.\n**Log 101** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-101-2026-02-25T05-41-05-901Z.log): testSpec task for the Accounting app's ReportList page, searching through task files to find relevant specifications.\n**Log 102** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-102-2026-02-25T05-43-36-027Z.log): writeApp task for building the NavBar, AccountsOverviewHeader, AccountCard, and AccountsPage components. I'm exploring the repository structure to understand the app layout and component organization.\n\n**Log 103** continues with more complex components like AccountHeader, BudgetOverview, TransactionsTab, BudgetDetailsTab, ReportingLinks, and AccountDetailPage. I'm running type checks and linting to validate the code, then searching through the repository for schema and database-related files to understand the data structure I'm working with.\n\n**Log 104** shifts focus to transaction-related UI components including TransactionHeaderFields, LineItemsTable, BalanceIndicator, TagsInput, and NewTransactionModal. I'm exploring the Netlify functions directory and shared TypeScript files, then running another type check and lint pass before searching for modal-related code patterns in the codebase.\n\nNow I'm refining my approach to systematically extract shell commands from each log. For every command invocation, I need to capture the exact command being run, what the agent was trying to accomplish, whether multiple attempts were made, and whether it succeeded. Let me go back through the logs more carefully to pull out all the shell commands with this structure in mind.","signature":"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

Let me write all analysis files. Let me map out the shell commands from each log:\n\n**Log 1** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-1): Idle worker, no shell commands.\n\n**Log 10** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-10): Unpack task for writeScript.\nShell commands:\n1. `npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/writeScript.md\" --subtask \"WriteDeployScript: Implement the deploy script for Accounting\" --subtask \"WriteTestScript: Implement the test script for Accounting\"` - Adding tasks to queue. Success.\n\n\n**Log 100** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-100): testSpec task for PlanPage/PlanComponent. The worker lists the tasks and apps directories, searches for revision files in the Accounting app, and attempts to download a report mockup image from a remote URL.\n\n**Log 101** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-101): testSpec task for ReportList page. Now exploring the repository structure more broadly—checking task files across different formats, listing top-level directories, and diving into the Accounting app's directory hierarchy to understand its organization.\n\n**Log 102** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-102): writeApp task for NavBar, AccountsOverviewHeader, AccountCard, and AccountsPage. I'm systematically navigating through the apps directory, examining the Accounting app's source structure, and checking what components and pages already exist.\n\nExploring the slices directory and looking for style guides and revision documentation to understand the design patterns and testing requirements.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering how the commands were executed—some came through the Task tool while others were direct shell commands. Looking at the log format more carefully, I need to distinguish between commands marked with `$` for direct shell execution versus those run through the Task subagent, though both ultimately show as shell commands in the output.\n\nParsing through Log 102, I started with direct filesystem exploration of the repo structure, then moved into a Task subagent to search for markdown and TypeScript files in the Accounting app, examine its directory structure, and check specific source directories. After that came more direct commands to inspect style guides, revision files, shared utilities, test documentation, and finally run the type checking and linting process.\n\nLog 103 continues within the Task subagent, exploring the apps directory structure and listing all files in the Accounting app with detailed permissions.\n\nNow I'm continuing to examine the Accounting app's source structure more granularly, looking at markdown documentation, style guides across the repo, database and schema-related files, and the serverless functions directory. I'm running a series of diagnostic commands to explore the Accounting app's structure—checking the source files, examining CSS patterns, verifying TypeScript compilation, and reviewing test documentation to understand what might be causing the issues. I'm running a series of diagnostic commands to check the project structure and build status—looking at the app directories, examining TypeScript files in the Accounting app, checking for type errors with the compiler, and then testing the build process with Vite to see what's failing. I'm exploring the directory structure of the Accounting app more thoroughly, checking the components, pages, slices, and netlify functions directories, plus looking for an AppStyle.md file at the root level.\n\nNow I'm going to run the npm check command in the Accounting directory to see what linting or build issues might exist, then I'll compile all the findings into analysis files.","signature":"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
