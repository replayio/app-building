No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings.

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it.

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n    15→   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4. CreateReportDialog (N/A)\n    19→   Description: A dialog to specify a report based on the accounts and their transactions. The layout likely includes controls or filters for selecting report type (e.g., summary, detailed, category-based), date ranges, and which accounts or categories (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) to include. The page also provides functionality to refresh or regenerate reports based on new parameters and may link back to specific account detail pages when users click on report items. Budget versus actual comparisons are a core feature of these reports.\n    20→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdH0QZwUJBicXIxYl7ANfnRyzLoKQCwtb1e8Wj\n    21→\n    22→5. ReportDetails (/reports/:id)\n    23→   Description: Details about the contents of a generated report.  The page displays reports that compare actual results to budgeted amounts, both at the account level and potentially at the specific-item level (e.g., big expenses). Reports may be shown as tables, charts, or both, highlighting variances between actual and budgeted figures.\n    24→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KduvOBXPH0NlcrvAhaRjg7E2zVpwb9xeY8LoBG\n    25→\n    26→6.

Images of different pages might not have consistent styling or navigation. Prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler alternatives when the mockup specifies something particular.\n4. Every clickable element needs its exact navigation target or action result documented.\n5.

Let me systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecReportDetails\n\nI need to check the ReportDetails test entries in docs/tests.md against the testSpec.md directives.\n\nLet me go through each directive:\n\n### Directive 1: Prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images\nThe mockup shows a left sidebar with Dashboard, All Reports, Budget Planning, Audit Logs, and a top nav with Reports, Budgeting, Settings. The test entries don't mention sidebar navigation, top nav, etc. \n\nThe ReportDetails tests focus on page-specific components like ReportHeader, VarianceSummary, VarianceChart, and DetailedReportTable, which makes sense since navigation elements are likely tested elsewhere as part of a shared NavBar component.\n\n### Directive 2: Systematically\n\nNow I'm going through the mockup to catalog every visible element. The top navigation includes the Acme Finance logo, Reports, Budgeting, and Settings tabs along with notification and user icons. The left sidebar has Dashboard, All Reports, Budget Planning, and Audit Logs. The main content area shows a breadcrumb trail, the report title with its ID, export buttons for PDF and CSV, a variance summary card displaying the total variance, actual and budgeted spend figures with a mini trend chart, and the beginning of what looks like a detailed report section below.\n\nLooking at what's further down, there's an Account Variances section with a bar chart breaking down variance by department, followed by a detailed report table with columns for account details, actual and budgeted amounts, variance figures and percentages, trends, and action buttons. The table supports expanding rows to show sub-items. The test coverage confirms that the header elements, variance summary indicators with directional arrows and color coding, and export functionality are all being validated. Actual Spend ✓, Budgeted Spend ✓, mini trend chart ✓, card layout ✓\n- VarianceChart: heading and subtitle ✓, paired bars ✓, x-axis labels ✓, y-axis amounts ✓, red bars for over-budget ✓, green bars for under-budget ✓, all accounts shown ✓, proportional heights ✓\n- DetailedReportTable: heading ✓, column headers ✓, account rows with name/label ✓, actual/budget/variance values ✓, expand/collapse chevron ✓, clicking expand reveals sub-items ✓, sub-item labels ✓, clicking collapse hides sub-items ✓, negative variance red ✓, negative percentage red with parentheses ✓, positive variance green ✓, positive percentage green ✓, zero variance ✓, sparkline trend ✓, View button ✓, View navigates to AccountDetailPage ✓, sub-items no View button ✓, multiple accounts listed ✓, expanding one doesn't affect others ✓, multiple can be expanded ✓\n\nI'm noticing the sidebar and top navigation elements aren't covered in these tests, but those are likely handled as shared components tested elsewhere rather than being specific to the ReportDetails page itself.\n\nNow I'm looking more carefully at the variance chart to make sure I understand the bar representation correctly—it looks like the bars show variance amounts with positive values extending upward and negative values extending downward from the zero line, with red indicating over-budget and green indicating under-budget. I've verified that all the interactive elements have their navigation targets and action results clearly defined—the breadcrumb goes to ReportList, the export buttons trigger PDF and CSV downloads, the chevrons expand and collapse sections, and the View button takes you to the account detail page. Now I need to check whether any user actions that change data are properly persisted and have the right side effects.\n\nSince this is primarily a read-only page with only export functionality that doesn't modify any underlying data, there aren't any data mutations to verify. The rest of the directives around modals, attachments, imports, and backend integrations don't apply here either.\n\nNow let me cross-check the mockup against the test coverage to make sure nothing's been missed. The expanded Operations row with its sub-items like Cloud Infrastructure and Office Lease is already tested, and the R&D row visible at the bottom is accounted for. I'm noticing the Operations account shows specific values in the mockup—$42,000 actual, $36,000 budget, -$3,500 variance—and I want to verify these match what's being tested for the sub-items.\n\nLooking at the sub-item breakdown, Cloud Infrastructure, Office Lease, and Travel add up to $17,000 actual and $14,500 budget, which doesn't match the Operations total of $42,000 and $36,000. That makes sense though—the sub-items probably represent only specific budgeted line items, not the complete account total. But I'm catching a discrepancy: the Operations variance shows -$3,500, yet $42,000 minus $36,000 should equal $6,000, not -$3,500.\n\nWait, I'm noticing something odd with the percentages too. The variance percentage listed is 70%, but that doesn't align with either the -$3,500 or the $6,000 difference. Looking back at the mockup though, Operations definitely shows -$3,500 and 70%, and interestingly, Cloud Infrastructure has the exact same values. That's suspicious—it seems like the Operations row might be pulling the variance data from the Cloud Infrastructure sub-item rather than calculating its own total variance. Looking at the math, that variance percentage checks out - the $4,000 loss is indeed 10.5% of the $38,000 budget. The Operations row seems to be showing Cloud Infrastructure's variance instead of its own, which is likely just how the mockup data is structured. Now I'm noticing some inconsistencies in the y-axis labels on the mockup - they seem to jump between different formats and values in a way that doesn't quite make sense. The y-axis labels in the mockup seem to have some inconsistencies with formatting, but the test spec captures the key examples: \"$50\", \"$60\", \"0\", \"-$30\", \"-$10\". Now I'm going back through the directives to make sure I haven't missed anything — I need to systematically check every visible element in the mockup, including sidebar navigation, headers, filters, buttons, and badges. Let me see if there's anything that isn't already covered by the test entries.\n\nThe sidebar and top navigation elements like the notification bell and user avatar are part of a shared NavBar component that's likely tested separately, not part of the ReportDetails page components. The test spec explicitly lists the components being tested here: ReportHeader, VarianceSummary, VarianceChart, and DetailedReportTable. So those shared navigation pieces probably don't belong in this particular test file.\n\nNow I'm checking the directive about clickable elements needing specific navigation targets or action results. Looking through the test entries, I can verify the breadcrumb link goes to ReportList, the export buttons trigger file downloads, and I need to finish checking the remaining clickable elements to ensure they all have clear, unambiguous outcomes specified.\n\nAll the interactive elements appear to have specific results defined, so the ReportDetails tests seem compliant with the requirements. Moving on to examine the actual component code against the writeApp.md

[2026-02-26T05:50:29.182Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_0189JGmfx1CkMJ7ERym1Uaz2","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me check each writeApp.md directive against the ReportDetails components:\n\n**Directive: Always run `npm run check` from the app directory**\nThis is a process directive, not something I check in code. N/A for this review.\n\n**Directive: When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.**\nI need to check if each test entry requirement is satisfied by the component code. Let me go through systematically.\n\n**Directive: Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup**\nI need to check if button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts match.\n\n\nNow I'm verifying that all interactive elements and containers have proper data-testid attributes for E2E testing. The remaining directives about netlify configuration, database drivers, and type conversions don't apply to these frontend components.\n\nFor the modal and select directives, these components don't use native HTML selects or have modals to worry about. The attachment-related directives also don't apply here. I need to check if the page components have the required consistent padding with the `p-6 max-sm:p-3` classes.\n\nLooking at ReportDetailsPage.tsx, I can see all the different states—loading, error, not found, and the main content—each have the proper padding applied. Now I'm verifying that the ReportHeader component meets the test requirements, starting with checking if it displays the report title with ID correctly.\n\nContinuing through the checklist: the breadcrumb navigation is there with the Reports link properly navigating back to the list, and both export buttons are styled correctly with their respective button classes. However, I'm noticing that the PDF export is using `window.print()` which opens the browser's print dialog rather than actually downloading a file—the test expects a PDF file download to be initiated, so this might be a gap between what the test expects and what's currently implemented.\n\nThe CSV export does properly create a blob and trigger a download, which is the right approach. The report title correctly pulls from the database using the report name and ID from props. Moving on to VarianceSummary, it's displaying the total variance with both amount and percentage, and the styling correctly shows negative variance in red with a down arrow and positive variance in green with an up arrow.\n\nThe component also shows actual and budgeted spend with formatted dollar amounts, and there's a sparkline chart rendered on the right side. The card uses a horizontal layout class that I should verify has the proper CSS for displaying everything in a single row.\n\nNow I'm checking the VarianceChart component to see if it has the heading and subtitle for the top account variances section.\n\nLooking at the bar chart implementation, there's a discrepancy between what the mockup shows and what the code renders. The mockup displays paired bars for each account—showing both Actual and Budgeted amounts side by side—but the code only renders a single variance bar per account. This seems like it might be cutting corners on the design requirements. Looking at the mockup more carefully, the bars appear to be single wider elements rather than clearly paired bars, though the test spec explicitly calls for \"grouped/paired bars\" which suggests the current implementation showing only a single variance bar per account doesn't match the requirement. Looking at the rest of the mockup, I can see green bars below the zero line for Sales and G&A, which confirms the paired bar interpretation. The test spec explicitly requires grouped/paired bars for Actual vs Budgeted, so the current single-bar implementation is a violation that needs to be flagged. Let me continue verifying the other requirements—checking that account labels appear on the x-axis, dollar amounts display on the y-axis, and the color coding matches the spec for over-budget and under-budget accounts.\n\nMoving on to the DetailedReportTable, I'm verifying the heading is present, all seven column headers are there, and each account row displays the name with its label, along with the Actual, Budget, Variance, and Variance % values.\n\nThe expand/collapse functionality works through a chevron that toggles visibility of sub-item rows, which display with an \"(Item)\" label. Negative variances are styled in red with parentheses around the percentage, while positive amounts are handled appropriately.\n\nContinuing through the remaining features: the Trend column renders sparklines for each row, the Actions column shows a View button for accounts that navigates to the account detail page, and sub-item rows correctly omit the View button.\n\nNow I'm verifying the data-testid attributes across the components to ensure proper test coverage for ReportDetailsPage, ReportHeader, and the export buttons.\n\nI should also check if the Breadcrumb component has appropriate test identifiers, then move through VarianceSummary and VarianceChart to confirm all the variance-related elements are properly tagged for testing.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test coverage across DetailedReportTable and noticing the data-testid attributes look solid overall. I'm also spotting a potential issue where the PDF export is using `window.print()` instead of actually initiating a file download, which could be problematic for the test expectations around PDF generation. Looking at the test description more carefully, it specifies showing variance between Actual and Budgeted amounts, which could mean either a single variance bar or paired bars for each value. The mockup suggests paired bars, but the color scheme in the example shows both bars in red for Marketing, which is unusual since you'd typically use different colors to distinguish Actual from Budget.\n\nLet me set aside the ambiguity here and focus on what's clearly a violation. The test explicitly mentions \"paired bars\" while the current implementation only displays single variance bars, so this is worth flagging as a potential mismatch even if the spec text about \"visual representation of budget variance\" could technically be satisfied either way.\n\nMoving on to definite issues: the export PDF feature uses `window.print()` instead of actually generating and downloading a proper PDF file with a filename. I should also double-check the component abstraction rule from the spec—looking at ReportDetailsPage, it properly delegates to separate components like NavBar, ReportHeader, VarianceSummary, VarianceChart, and DetailedReportTable. The inline JSX for loading and error states are minimal and follow standard patterns, so those shouldn't count as violations. Though I'm noticing the Sparkline component in VarianceSummary might need closer inspection. The Export PDF button currently just triggers the browser's print dialog, but the test spec requires it to actually download a PDF file with specific content and a named filename—there's a clear gap between what the test expects and what the code does.\n\nI'm also reconsidering whether the paired bars issue is a violation. The test spec explicitly mentions \"grouped/paired bars,\" and the current implementation renders single bars instead. Let me look at the exact wording again to determine if this is also a clear mismatch I should flag. Looking more carefully at the mockup, I can see paired bars for each account—one slightly taller red bar next to another for Marketing and Operations, with smaller pairs for R&D, and green pairs below zero for Sales and G&A. But I'm second-guessing myself on whether this is actually a variance chart or an Actual vs Budgeted comparison, since the title says \"Top Account Variances\" which suggests it should be showing variance directly rather than the raw values side by side.\n\nHowever, the test explicitly mentions \"paired bars per account,\" which is pretty clear—I need to implement that structure regardless of my interpretation of what makes sense for a variance chart.\n\nLooking at the color tests more carefully though, they describe red bars for over-budget accounts extending above zero and green bars for under-budget accounts extending below zero. If these were truly paired bars showing both Actual and Budget values, both would extend upward since amounts are positive. The directional behavior described—extending above or below zero based on variance direction—actually suggests a single variance bar implementation, which contradicts the paired bars test requirement. Actual and budgeted amounts would both be positive values, so there wouldn't be a meaningful zero line separating over-budget from under-budget—that description fits single variance bars much better. The majority of test entries point to variance bars rather than paired bars, so I'm not flagging that as a violation. The only real issue I'm seeing is the PDF export using `window.print()` instead of a proper download. Let me reconsider that approach though...\n\n`window.print()` is actually a common pattern for PDF exports in web apps, and users can save as PDF from the print dialog. The test just requires that a PDF download is initiated and the filename includes the report name, but `window.print()` doesn't give control over the filename. Now I should check what the writeApp.md directives actually require—looking at test entry satisfaction, visual mockup matching, data-testid attributes, and the other specific requirements. For #3, I'm checking whether the visual styling matches the mockup by looking at button variants, section layouts, and color coding in the code—all of which appear correct. The Export PDF function using `window.print()` stands out as the main potential issue, but reconsidering the directive, it's asking whether test entry requirements are satisfied, not necessarily whether the implementation method matches a specific approach, so this might not be a violation after all.\n\nWait, actually looking at the test entry more carefully—it specifies a PDF file download with a controlled filename and formatted content—`window.print()` doesn't fully meet those requirements since it opens a print dialog rather than initiating a direct download, and the filename defaults to the browser's choice rather than being controllable. This does violate the directive's requirement that test entries be fully satisfied, so I should flag this as a fix task.\n\nI should also verify whether the `handleExportPdf` function has a comment linking it to the specific test it exercises, as the directive requires.\n\nChecking the JSX in both ReportHeader.tsx and DetailedReportTable.tsx, I'm not seeing test title comments next to the export buttons or expand/view buttons—these interactive elements are missing the required test references. I need to distinguish between the Requirements and Directives sections of testSpec.md—the checkDirectives skill specifically targets directives, not general requirements. The comment-in-JSX requirement falls under Requirements, so it's probably outside the scope of what I'm checking. Let me focus on the actual Directives sections in both documents.\n\nFor the ReportDetails component check against writeApp.md directives, I'm verifying data-testid attributes on interactive elements, proper page padding, and absence of native select elements. But I'm noticing the Directives section in writeApp.md is quite brief—it covers running npm check, identifying test entries, matching mockups, and including data-testid attributes. Some of the items I was checking against might actually be in the Tips section rather than the formal Directives.\n\nLooking at what actually applies to this component: test entries need to be satisfied (particularly the Export PDF functionality), visual appearance should match the mockup, data-testid attributes are already in place, no native selects are being used, and the consistent padding is applied. The main gap I'm seeing is whether the Export PDF test entry is fully satisfied.\n\nThe `window.print()` approach is standard for web-based PDF export, though the test might expect a specific filename which feels like an overly strict requirement. Let me verify there aren't any other directive violations by checking the component code once more—no native select elements or hardcoded styles that should be moved to CSS. Actually, I need to reconsider the PDF export implementation. The test spec requires a PDF file download with a specific filename containing the report name or ID, plus formatted content including the title, variance summary, chart, and table. But `window.print()` doesn't guarantee a PDF download, doesn't control the filename, and doesn't ensure proper formatting—so the current implementation doesn't actually satisfy the spec

The only reference to `/reports/` is in the accounts-page spec checking navigation.\n\nFor the writeTests.md directives check, I need to check if there are tests that violate the directives. But there are NO tests for ReportDetails at all! This itself is a significant issue - there should be tests written for all the test spec entries on the ReportDetails page.\n\nLet me think about how to handle this. The skill says \"During each checking subtask you need to read the skill document and all the directives, and then go through all the documentation / code you are checking to look for violations of those directives.\"\n\n\nSince there's no test code to examine, there can't be directive violations—but the real issue is that none of the test entries are being satisfied at all. I should report that ReportDetails tests are missing entirely and flag this as a gap that needs to be addressed. Actually, writing tests is a different skill (writeTests.md), not checkDirectives.md. The checkDirectives skill is about checking for violations in existing code/docs.\n\nLet me just report that no tests exist and move on. The fact that tests haven't been written yet is a gap but not a \"directive violation\" per se. However, the absence of tests could be flagged as a task that needs to be done. Looking at the other test spec files for this app, tests were written for AccountsPage and AccountDetailPage, but ReportDetails, ReportList, TransactionsPage, CreateReportDialog, and NewTransactionModal don't have test files yet—these are likely in the pipeline to be written.\n\nSince my subtask is to check for writeTests.md directive violations in ReportDetails tests, and there are no tests, I'll report no violations found. Let me also check if there are report-list tests that might test some ReportDetails functionality.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":228,"cache_read_input_tokens":70528,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":228,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3b6ad4af-1ff5-4234-871d-ecd53a53c565","uuid":"14cbf1b5-b405-45e0-913a-d793e71a685c"}
