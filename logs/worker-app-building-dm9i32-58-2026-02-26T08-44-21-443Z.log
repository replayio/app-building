CalendarPage (/calendar)\n    11→   Description: Calendar view to schedule and visualize production runs over time. The main layout is a calendar (daily/weekly/monthly views) showing each scheduled production run as an event or block. Users can click on a date to create a new production run or select an existing run to open its details page or modal. Each event shows key info such as product/recipe name, quantity, and status. The page includes navigation controls to move between weeks/months, and may integrate data from external inventory and delivery scheduling apps to visually indicate availability constraints (e.g., color coding runs with material shortages). Drag-and-drop or editing of events may be used to reschedule runs. This page is the central hub for planning when production runs occur.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdTvUTHD7IfSRxAhcbzPKXQNjVd4MGOspvJ9t0\n    13→\n    14→3.

(2) Recipe and raw materials section listing each material required, the amount needed for the planned quantity, and units. (3) Forecast/availability section showing projected inventory levels for each material at the time of the run, based on data from the separate inventory tracking and delivery scheduling apps. This may include columns like required amount, forecast available amount, shortage/excess, and any pending delivery details. (4) equipment the run will require and availability. Users can adjust quantities, confirm or cancel the run, and view links to related records in the external apps.

I'll need to add those, then check how similar cancel tests are structured elsewhere in the codebase to follow the established pattern.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":13716,"cache_read_input_tokens":27991,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":13716,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"61067c70-8e2b-4e72-9240-de39b0668f9f","uuid":"62600072-d580-4416-b074-69fac7a7eee1"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken.

Check if there's a data-testid pattern for cancel buttons in modals\n\nAlso look at: /repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md for any existing modal cancel entries in other page sections (like CalendarPage, RunDetailsPage, etc.)\n\nReport the exact patterns used including test IDs, test entry formats, and data-testid values."}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_014fjqPpm8u5D9BNcQ9gmJ8d","session_id":"61067c70-8e2b-4e72-9240-de39b0668f9f","uuid":"740ec1fd-4d69-48ad-b846-a76fe72b6ce8"}

Now I have a comprehensive view of the patterns. Let me compile the report with all the findings.\n\n## Modal Cancel/Dismiss Test Patterns Report\n\nBased on my comprehensive search of the ProductionHub codebase, here are the exact patterns used for modal cancel/dismiss testing:\n\n### 1. DATA-TESTID PATTERNS FOR CANCEL/CLOSE BUTTONS\n\n**Modal Close (X) Buttons:**\n- `add-recipe-modal-close` (RecipesHeader.tsx, line 232)\n- `new-run-modal-close` (CalendarHeader.tsx, line 275)\n- `adjust-quantity-close` (RunActions.tsx, line 118)\n- `edit-recipe-modal-close` (RecipesTable.tsx)\n- `add-equipment-modal-close` (EquipmentHeader.tsx)\n- `edit-equipment-modal-close` (EquipmentTable.tsx)\n- `recipe-panel-close` (RecipeDetailsPanel.tsx)\n- `run-popup-close-btn` (RunDetailsPopup.tsx)\n\n**Modal Cancel Buttons (secondary buttons in footer):**\n- `add-recipe-cancel-btn` (RecipesHeader.tsx, line 341)\n- `new-run-cancel-btn` (CalendarHeader.tsx, line 384)\n- `adjust-quantity-cancel` (RunActions.tsx, line 146)\n- `edit-recipe-cancel-btn` (RecipesTable.tsx)\n- `add-equipment-cancel-btn` (EquipmentHeader.tsx)\n- `edit-equipment-cancel-btn` (EquipmentTable.tsx)\n\n**Dialog Cancel Buttons (confirmation dialogs):**\n- `confirm-dialog-cancel` (used for cancellation confirmations)\n\n### 2. TEST ENTRY FORMAT IN tests.md\n\nThe standard format for modal cancel tests follows this pattern:\n\n```markdown\n#### [PAGE-SECTION]-[NUMBER]: [Test Title]\n- **Components:** [Component List]\n- **Given** [initial state]\n- **When** the user [action to open modal], then [fills in fields], then clicks the \"Cancel\" button on the modal [or X close button]\n- **Then** the modal closes and [expected result - no data created/saved]\n```\n\n**Examples from tests.md:**\n\n1. **Recipe Modal Cancel (REC-HDR-15):**\n```\n#### REC-HDR-15: Cancelling Add Recipe modal does not create a recipe\n- **Components:** RecipesHeader\n- **Given** the user navigates to /recipes\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Cancel\" button on the modal\n- **Then** the modal closes and no new recipe is added to the RecipesTable\n```\n\n2. **Calendar Modal Cancel (CAL-HDR-16, CAL-HDR-17, CAL-HDR-18):**\n```\n#### CAL-HDR-16: Cancelling New Production Run modal does not create a run\n- **When** the user fills in the recipe, start date, end date, and quantity, then clicks the \"Cancel\" button on the modal\n- **Then** the modal closes and no new production run is created on the calendar grid\n\n#### CAL-HDR-17: Closing New Production Run modal with X button does not create a run\n- **When** the user fills in the recipe, start date, end date, and quantity, then clicks the close (X) button on the modal header\n- **Then** the modal closes and no new production run is created on the calendar grid\n\n#### CAL-HDR-18: Clicking overlay dismisses New Production Run modal without creating a run\n- **When** the user fills in the recipe, start date, end date, and quantity, then clicks the overlay (outside the modal content) to dismiss\n- **Then** the modal closes and no new production run is created on the calendar grid\n```\n\n3. **Run Details Modal Cancel (RUN-ACT-10):**\n```\n#### RUN-ACT-10: Adjust Quantities modal can be dismissed without saving\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Cancel\" button or the X close button on the modal\n- **Then** the modal closes [and quantity remains unchanged]\n```\n\n### 3. PLAYWRIGHT TEST IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS\n\n**Three-button cancel pattern (most common):**\n```typescript\n// Cancel button\nawait page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-cancel-btn\").click();\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\")).toBeHidden();\n\n// X close button\nawait page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal-close\").click();\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\")).toBeHidden();\n\n// Overlay click (backdrop dismiss)\nawait page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\").click({ position: { x: 1, y: 1 } });\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\")).toBeHidden();\n```\n\n**Specific test examples from codebase:**\n\n- **recipes-page.spec.ts (lines 270, 646):**\n  ```typescript\n  await page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-cancel-btn\").click();\n  await page.getByTestId(\"edit-recipe-cancel-btn\").click();\n  ```\n\n- **calendar-header.spec.ts (line 333):**\n  ```typescript\n  await page.getByTestId(\"new-run-cancel-btn\").click();\n  ```\n\n- **run-details.spec.ts (lines 563, 507):**\n  ```typescript\n  await page.getByTestId(\"adjust-quantity-cancel\").click();\n  await page.getByTestId(\"confirm-dialog-cancel\").click();\n  ```\n\n### 4. MODAL STRUCTURE PATTERNS\n\n**Standard Modal HTML Structure:**\n```jsx\n<div className=\"modal-overlay\" data-testid=\"[modal-name]\" onClick={onClose}>\n  <div className=\"modal-content\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n    <div className=\"modal-header\">\n      <h2 className=\"modal-title\">[Title]</h2>\n      <button className=\"modal-close-btn\" data-testid=\"[modal-name]-close\" onClick={onClose}>\n        {/* X SVG */}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n    {/* Form content */}\n    <div className=\"modal-footer\">\n      <button className=\"btn-secondary\" data-testid=\"[modal-name]-cancel-btn\" onClick={onClose}>\n        Cancel\n      </button>\n      <button className=\"btn-primary\" data-testid=\"[modal-name]-submit-btn\" onClick={handleSubmit}>\n        Save/Create\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### 5. KEY NAMING CONVENTIONS\n\nPattern: `[action]-[component]-[element-type]` or `[component]-[action]-[element-type]`\n\n- Modal containers: `{action}-modal` or `{action}-run-modal`\n- Close buttons: `{action}-modal-close` or `{element}-close-btn`\n- Cancel buttons: `{action}-cancel-btn` or `{action}-{component}-cancel-btn`\n- Confirmation dialogs: `confirm-dialog-cancel` for the cancel action\n\n### 6. MODAL OVERLAY DISMISS PATTERN\n\nThe overlay click pattern uses a specific coordinate technique:\n```typescript\n// Click at position (1, 1) to hit the overlay but not the modal-content\nawait page.getByTestId(\"new-run-modal\").click({ position: { x: 1, y: 1 } });\n```\n\nThis works because the modal-content has `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}`, so clicking the overlay directly triggers the modal's `onClick={onClose}` handler.\n\n### 7. CONFIRMATION DIALOG PATTERN\n\nFor action confirmations (like \"Cancel Run\"), the pattern uses a shared ConfirmDialog component:\n```typescript\n// Show dialog\nawait page.getByTestId(\"cancel-run-btn\").click();\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"confirm-dialog\")).toBeVisible();\n\n// Cancel the confirmation\nawait page.getByTestId(\"confirm-dialog-cancel\").click();\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"confirm-dialog\")).toBeHidden();\n```\n\nAll files referenced are located in `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/`."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: aa4c47e7b0ed57b82 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 73314\ntool_uses: 13\nduration_ms: 29688</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"61067c70-8e2b-4e72-9240-de39b0668f9f","uuid":"ef33b2bc-eae1-4609-bf67-5df7cff7b4cd","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"In the /repo/apps/ProductionHub/ directory, search for existing modal cancel/dismiss test patterns.

TEST ENTRY FORMAT IN tests.md\n\nThe standard format for modal cancel tests follows this pattern:\n\n```markdown\n#### [PAGE-SECTION]-[NUMBER]: [Test Title]\n- **Components:** [Component List]\n- **Given** [initial state]\n- **When** the user [action to open modal], then [fills in fields], then clicks the \"Cancel\" button on the modal [or X close button]\n- **Then** the modal closes and [expected result - no data created/saved]\n```\n\n**Examples from tests.md:**\n\n1. **Recipe Modal Cancel (REC-HDR-15):**\n```\n#### REC-HDR-15: Cancelling Add Recipe modal does not create a recipe\n- **Components:** RecipesHeader\n- **Given** the user navigates to /recipes\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Cancel\" button on the modal\n- **Then** the modal closes and no new recipe is added to the RecipesTable\n```\n\n2. **Calendar Modal Cancel (CAL-HDR-16, CAL-HDR-17, CAL-HDR-18):**\n```\n#### CAL-HDR-16: Cancelling New Production Run modal does not create a run\n- **When** the user fills in the recipe, start date, end date, and quantity, then clicks the \"Cancel\" button on the modal\n- **Then** the modal closes and no new production run is created on the calendar grid\n\n#### CAL-HDR-17: Closing New Production Run modal with X button does not create a run\n- **When** the user fills in the recipe, start date, end date, and quantity, then clicks the close (X) button on the modal header\n- **Then** the modal closes and no new production run is created on the calendar grid\n\n#### CAL-HDR-18: Clicking overlay dismisses New Production Run modal without creating a run\n- **When** the user fills in the recipe, start date, end date, and quantity, then clicks the overlay (outside the modal content) to dismiss\n- **Then** the modal closes and no new production run is created on the calendar grid\n```\n\n3. **Run Details Modal Cancel (RUN-ACT-10):**\n```\n#### RUN-ACT-10: Adjust Quantities modal can be dismissed without saving\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Cancel\" button or the X close button on the modal\n- **Then** the modal closes [and quantity remains unchanged]\n```\n\n### 3. PLAYWRIGHT TEST IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS\n\n**Three-button cancel pattern (most common):**\n```typescript\n// Cancel button\nawait page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-cancel-btn\").click();\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\")).toBeHidden();\n\n// X close button\nawait page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal-close\").click();\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\")).toBeHidden();\n\n// Overlay click (backdrop dismiss)\nawait page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\").click({ position: { x: 1, y: 1 } });\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-modal\")).toBeHidden();\n```\n\n**Specific test examples from codebase:**\n\n- **recipes-page.spec.ts (lines 270, 646):**\n  ```typescript\n  await page.getByTestId(\"add-recipe-cancel-btn\").click();\n  await page.getByTestId(\"edit-recipe-cancel-btn\").click();\n  ```\n\n- **calendar-header.spec.ts (line 333):**\n  ```typescript\n  await page.getByTestId(\"new-run-cancel-btn\").click();\n  ```\n\n- **run-details.spec.ts (lines 563, 507):**\n  ```typescript\n  await page.getByTestId(\"adjust-quantity-cancel\").click();\n  await page.getByTestId(\"confirm-dialog-cancel\").click();\n  ```\n\n### 4. MODAL STRUCTURE PATTERNS\n\n**Standard Modal HTML Structure:**\n```jsx\n<div className=\"modal-overlay\" data-testid=\"[modal-name]\" onClick={onClose}>\n  <div className=\"modal-content\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n    <div className=\"modal-header\">\n      <h2 className=\"modal-title\">[Title]</h2>\n      <button className=\"modal-close-btn\" data-testid=\"[modal-name]-close\" onClick={onClose}>\n        {/* X SVG */}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n    {/* Form content */}\n    <div className=\"modal-footer\">\n      <button className=\"btn-secondary\" data-testid=\"[modal-name]-cancel-btn\" onClick={onClose}>\n        Cancel\n      </button>\n      <button className=\"btn-primary\" data-testid=\"[modal-name]-submit-btn\" onClick={handleSubmit}>\n        Save/Create\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### 5. KEY NAMING CONVENTIONS\n\nPattern: `[action]-[component]-[element-type]` or `[component]-[action]-[element-type]`\n\n- Modal containers: `{action}-modal` or `{action}-run-modal`\n- Close buttons: `{action}-modal-close` or `{element}-close-btn`\n- Cancel buttons: `{action}-cancel-btn` or `{action}-{component}-cancel-btn`\n- Confirmation dialogs: `confirm-dialog-cancel` for the cancel action\n\n### 6. MODAL OVERLAY DISMISS PATTERN\n\nThe overlay click pattern uses a specific coordinate technique:\n```typescript\n// Click at position (1, 1) to hit the overlay but not the modal-content\nawait page.getByTestId(\"new-run-modal\").click({ position: { x: 1, y: 1 } });\n```\n\nThis works because the modal-content has `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}`, so clicking the overlay directly triggers the modal's `onClick={onClose}` handler.\n\n### 7. CONFIRMATION DIALOG PATTERN\n\nFor action confirmations (like \"Cancel Run\"), the pattern uses a shared ConfirmDialog component:\n```typescript\n// Show dialog\nawait page.getByTestId(\"cancel-run-btn\").click();\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"confirm-dialog\")).toBeVisible();\n\n// Cancel the confirmation\nawait page.getByTestId(\"confirm-dialog-cancel\").click();\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"confirm-dialog\")).toBeHidden();\n```\n\nAll files referenced are located in `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/`."}],"totalDurationMs":29688,"totalTokens":73314,"totalToolUseCount":13,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11647,"cache_read_input_tokens":59672,"output_tokens":1988,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11647},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

This is the single entry point for running\n     7→tests during development and debugging.\n     8→\n     9→## Usage\n    10→\n    11→- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n    12→- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n    13→- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n    14→\n    15→## Behavior\n    16→\n    17→1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n    18→   previous runs.\n    19→\n    20→2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n    21→   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n    22→\n    23→3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n    24→   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n    25→\n    26→4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n    27→   test data.\n    28→\n    29→5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n    30→   prior runs.\n    31→\n    32→6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n    33→   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n    34→   `DATABASE_URL`.

Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n    41→      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n    42→      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n    43→   b. Append full metadata for every recording that has test metadata to the log file in a\n    44→      delimited block:\n    45→      ```\n    46→      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n    47→      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n    48→      ...\n    49→      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n    50→      ```\n    51→   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n    52→      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n    53→      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n    54→      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, append `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` to the\n    55→      log file. On failure, log the exit code.\n    56→\n    57→9. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n    58→   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n    59→\n    60→10. **Print summary** to stdout: a single line like `10 passed` or\n    61→    `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`. Include the uploaded recording ID\n    62→    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n    63→\n    64→11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n    65→\n    66→## Inputs\n    67→\n    68→- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n    69→- **Environment variables**:\n    70→  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n    71→  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n    72→  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n    73→  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    74→    template for ephemeral branches.\n    75→  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    76→    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n    77→- **Files**:\n    78→  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n    79→  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n    80→\n    81→## Outputs\n    82→\n    83→- **stdout**: One-line summary only. Never verbose test output.\n    84→- **`logs/test-run-N.log`**: Full Playwright output, recording metadata, and upload results.\n    85→  `N` increments each run (find the highest existing number and add 1).\n    86→- **Side effects**:\n    87→  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n    88→  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n    89→  - Removes local recording files.\n    90→- **Exit codes**:\n    91→  - 0: All tests passed.\n    92→  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n    93→\n    94→## Implementation Tips\n    95→\n    96→- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n    97→- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n    98→  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n    99→- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON.

This is the single entry point for running\ntests during development and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n   previous runs.\n\n2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n\n3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n\n4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n   test data.\n\n5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n   prior runs.\n\n6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n   `DATABASE_URL`. Pipe all Playwright output to a log file (see Outputs).\n\n7. **Parse results**: Count passed/failed/skipped tests from the Playwright JSON reporter output\n   at `test-results/results.json`.\n\n8. **On failure** (non-zero exit code):\n   a. Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n   b. Append full metadata for every recording that has test metadata to the log file in a\n      delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, append `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` to the\n      log file. On failure, log the exit code.\n\n9. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n10. **Print summary** to stdout: a single line like `10 passed` or\n    `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`. Include the uploaded recording ID\n    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n\n11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: One-line summary only. Never verbose test output.\n- **`logs/test-run-N.log`**: Full Playwright output, recording metadata, and upload results.\n  `N` increments each run (find the highest existing number and add 1).\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON. The\n  `addMetadata` entries contain `metadata.test.result` which indicates pass/fail.\n- The Playwright config must use the Replay browser via `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n  from `@replayio/playwright` and include `replayReporter` with `upload: false`.\n- The HTML reporter must use `open: 'never'` to suppress the interactive \"Serving HTML report\"\n  prompt that blocks the script from exiting.\n- Run Playwright with `--retries 0` — no retries. Failures must be analyzed via Replay.\n- Do NOT inherit stdio from Playwright. Pipe stdout and stderr to the log file using\n  `child_process.execSync` with `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` or similar, then write\n  the captured output to the log file.\n- Use the JSON reporter (`test-results/results.json`) to parse pass/fail counts for the\n  summary line.\n- The `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` env var is already set in the container.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}
