There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c0887ab5-d440-4b4c-8f52-4216f205687e","uuid":"c7e1d9b7-4867-4d8a-a737-00b433966396","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

I should continue from where the previous thought ended and incorporate these remaining requirements into the testing approach.\n\nData mutations need verification that changes persist and side effects are correct, button styling and text must match the mockup exactly, modals require thorough testing, file uploads should be supported unless specified otherwise, import dialogs must show format documentation upfront, configurable backend integrations need visible setup instructions, and any state-changing action should trigger appropriate updates elsewhere in the app including timeline entries if applicable.\n\nNow I'm going through the ClientsListPage test entries to verify they align with these directives, checking each component's tests against the

All app routes are protected by a RequireAuth guard that redirects unauthenticated users to /login. The sidebar displays the authenticated user's name, avatar, and a sign-out button.

Removed Login and Register pages. Removed RequireAuth route guard — all pages are accessible without authentication. SSO (Google OAuth) now opens in a popup window instead of navigating the current window. The sidebar user area moved to the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.

Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n    28→\n    29→2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. The Settings page has two sections: (1) Import & Export — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV. (2) Webhooks — CRUD for webhook configurations that can send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint. Sidebar navigation now includes Clients, Deals, Tasks, and Settings.\n    30→\n    31→2/19/2026: Webhook modal now includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs).

Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    34→\n    35→2/18/2026: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) and User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId).

User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. Added /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members. Sidebar now has \"Team\" nav item.

The spec calls for inventorying every visible element—client name, type, status, tags, primary contact, deal counts, next task, search, filtering by status/tags/source, sorting, pagination, and buttons for adding/importing clients—so I need to verify these are all covered in the test documentation.\n\nLooking at the test coverage, I see entries across SidebarNavigation, PageHeader, SearchBar, FilterControls, ClientsTable, RowActionMenu, and Pagination that collectively address these requirements. The table columns themselves (Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, Open Deals, Next Task) all involve joins or computed values, and they're all being tested. For clickable elements, I'm verifying that navigation targets are explicitly specified—like the sidebar navigation tests that define exact routes, the header test for the create client modal, and I'm partway through checking the remaining action buttons. HDR-04: Opens import dialog - OK\n   - CLP-HDR-05: Triggers file download - OK\n   - CLP-TBL-04: Navigates to /clients/acme-corp-451 - OK\n   - CLP-ACT-03: Navigates to ClientDetailPage - OK\n   - CLP-ACT-04: Shows confirmation dialog, deletes - OK\n   - CLP-ACT-05: Navigates to ClientDetailPage - OK\n   - CLP-PGN-02: Loads next set - OK\n   - All clickable elements have specific targets. Good.\n\n5. **For user actions that mutate data, verify persistence and side effects** - \n   - CLP-HDR-03: Creating a client - says \"persisted to the database (page reload still shows it)\" - OK\n   - CLP-HDR-06: CSV import - verifies client appears after closing dialog - OK\n   - CLP-HDR-08: CSV import creates contacts - verifies import result - OK\n   - CLP-ACT-04: Delete - says \"deletion is persisted (page reload confirms it)\" - OK\n\n6. **Button and control appearance** - CLP-HDR-01 specifies \"Import (with download icon)\", \"Import Contacts (with contacts icon)\", \"Export (with upload icon)\", \"+ Add New Client (primary/accent styled button)\" - OK\n\n7. **Completely test modal dialogs** - \n   - CLP-HDR-02: Tests that Add New Client modal opens with correct fields. OK\n   - CLP-HDR-03: Tests creating a client through the modal. OK\n   - CLP-HDR-04: Tests import dialog fields, CSV format info, disabled import button. OK\n   - CLP-HDR-06: Tests CSV import through the dialog. OK\n   - CLP-HDR-07: Tests contacts import dialog. OK\n   - CLP-HDR-08: Tests contacts CSV import. OK\n   - CLP-ACT-04: Tests confirmation dialog for delete. OK\n   - Looks comprehensive.\n\n8. **Attachment functionality should support file uploads** - N/A for ClientsListPage (no attachment features).\n\n9. **Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format** - \n   - CLP-HDR-04: \"CSV column format specification table (data-testid=\"csv-format-info\") showing column names and descriptions including required \"Name\" column\" - OK\n   - CLP-HDR-07: \"CSV column format specification table showing columns including required 'Name' and optional 'Client Name'\" - OK\n\n10. **Backend integrations with complete setup instructions** - N/A for ClientsListPage (no webhooks or API connections on this page).\n\n11. **State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update** - Creating and deleting clients are tested to appear in the list and persist, with cross-cutting tests covering whether other pages reflect these changes appropriately.\n\nOverall for Job 1, the test entries appear comprehensive and aligned with the directives—they systematically cover all components, interactive elements, and specify exact navigation targets and side effects. Let me verify against the directive to inventory every visible element. The spec describes four buttons in the header: Import, Import Contacts, Export, and Add New Client, which CLP-HDR-01 captures, so the coverage looks solid.\n\nI'm also cross-checking the sidebar navigation against the AppRevisions. The latest updates show that Team was added on 2/18/2026, and CLP-NAV-01 correctly lists all five nav items: Clients, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings. That matches the current state.\n\nNow I'm verifying the route mappings in CLP-NAV-02—each navigation link points to the right path, and they all check out. Finally, I'm looking at the StatusBadge component to confirm the color assignments match what the test expects: green for Active, gray for Inactive, blue/yellow for Prospect, and red/orange for Churned.\n\nJob 1 looks clean with no violations. Moving on to Job 2, I need to validate the ClientsListPage against the writeApp.md requirements: checking that test entries are satisfied, visual elements match the mockup, and all components have proper data-testid attributes. I'm going through each component now—ClientsListPage has the root testid, ClientsPageHeader has testids for the header and buttons...\n\nChecking remaining testids... I'm checking the remaining guidelines—the monorepo netlify config, neon driver syntax, database type conversions, and netlify functions aren't relevant to the frontend component. For modals with entity references, AddClientModal correctly uses FilterSelect for Type and Status, while Tags remains a free-form comma-separated input since those aren't entity references.\n\nNow I need to verify the Sidebar component doesn't have duplicate navigation links, and I've confirmed no native HTML select elements are being used—everything properly uses FilterSelect instead. Attachment-related guidelines don't apply to this page.\n\nLet me also make sure all interactive elements have the required `data-testid` attributes. Looking at directive 3 more carefully, I need to cross-reference the test documentation with what's actually implemented—the header buttons like import, import-contacts, export, and add-new-client all appear to have matching testids, which is good.\n\nNow I need to check the ImportDialog component to verify it has all the testids mentioned in CLP-HDR-04: the dialog itself, CSV format info, download template button, file input, and the cancel/submit buttons. I haven't reviewed that component yet, so that's next on my list.\n\nI'm also thinking through the writeApp.md directives more carefully. The StatusBadge component is already using CSS variables for domain-specific colors like `text-status-active` and `text-status-churned`, which aligns with that requirement. I should verify that components are layout-agnostic as well.\n\nLooking at the padding and margin rule, ClientsPageHeader has `mb-6` on its root element which violates the directive against outer margins. The other components look fine—ClientsSearchBar, ClientsFilterControls, and ClientsTable don't have outer padding or margin. ClientsPagination does have `mt-4`, `px-4`, and `py-3`, but those appear to be internal spacing rather than outer margins. I'm realizing I might be overthinking the directive violations here. The core principle is about keeping components layout-agnostic, but there's nuance—margin between sibling elements and padding within a bordered container serve different purposes than arbitrary outer spacing that couples a component to its parent layout.\n\nThe only real issue I see is ClientsPageHeader's `mb-6`, which is external margin affecting layout flow, though it's minor enough that it might be intentional. Now I need to verify the button text matches the test spec—it should say \"Import\" with a download icon.\n\nChecking each button: Import, Import Contacts, and Export all match their expected icons and labels. But the \"Add New Client\" button is flagged in the test as \"+ Add New Client\" while the actual button renders the Plus icon separately from the text \"Add New Client\"—so there's a discrepancy between what the test expects as text versus what's actually displayed.\n\nNow I need to verify the SharedImportDialog component has the correct data-testid attributes, then move on to Job 3 and validate the Playwright tests against the writeTests.md directives.\n\nLooking at the navigation tests, they're asserting URLs with regex patterns for deals, tasks, users, settings, and clients routes—those check out. The client detail page navigation tests are also verifying the correct URL format with the clientId parameter. For the side effects directive, I need to confirm that CLP-HDR-03 properly validates both the client creation and its appearance in the list.\n\nNow examining the remaining tests: CLP-ACT-04 handles deletion and verifies the client is removed after reload, though it doesn't check for cascading data removal—but that's handled by cross-cutting tests. The CSV import tests verify the result message and that clients appear correctly. I'm also checking for problematic `getByText()` usage, particularly with common words like \"Clients\" in the sidebar that could match multiple elements. The remaining selectors look solid—they're all scoped appropriately or specific enough. I should verify that data-testid values stay consistent across test files, though that's likely handled by the component definitions themselves. The file upload tests are exercising the actual mechanics with buffers, which is good practice.\n\nNow checking for violations of the rule against putting Playwright locator calls with auto-wait inside `.toPass()` retry blocks. Most tests use atomic assertions correctly, but CLP-FLT-08 is extracting text content and comparing sort order inside the retry block...\n\nActually, `allTextContents()` doesn't auto-wait—it just returns what's currently in the DOM—so that's fine. The directive specifically warns about methods like `count()`, `textContent()`, and `isVisible()` that do auto-wait, and this isn't one of them.\n\nMoving on to check CLP-FLT-09...\n\nthis one uses `count()` inside `.toPass()`, which the directive flags as problematic. But looking at the Playwright docs more carefully, `count()` actually returns immediately without auto-waiting, so this shouldn't trigger the issue the directive is concerned about.\n\nActually, wait—the directive explicitly lists `count()` as something to avoid inside `.toPass()` blocks, so this is a violation regardless of whether it works in practice. Let me scan through all the `.toPass()` calls to find violations like this one.\n\nI'm seeing the same problematic pattern repeated across multiple test cases: `count()` being called inside `.toPass()` blocks, which directly contradicts the directive. Some of these assertions are also trivially true (like checking if count is greater than or equal to zero), which means they're not actually validating anything meaningful while still breaking the rule. Looking at the GOOD example in the directive, I can see the proper pattern uses `toHaveCount()` with a timeout instead of calling `count()` inside `.toPass()`. I need to rewrite the violations I found—CLP-FLT-06 should use `toHaveCount()` with an explicit timeout, and CLP-TBL-08 needs to be split into separate atomic assertions rather than relying on `count()` within a retry loop.\n\nI'm also noting that CLP-FLT-08 uses `allTextContents()` which isn't explicitly mentioned in the directive's examples and doesn't auto-wait, so that's borderline but I'll leave it for now. Moving on to check the remaining rules about strategy files and parallel test design.\n\nLooking at the parallel test assertions more carefully, most of them handle relative comparisons or patterns correctly—CLP-ACT-04 checks if count decreased, CLP-TBL-08 verifies count is positive, and CLP-PGN-01 validates the pagination pattern. But CLP-SRCH-03 has a weak assertion that's always true, and I need to keep examining the rest of the tests. SRCH-04 (line 344): Same weak assertion.\n   - CLP-FLT-04 (line 449): Same weak assertion.\n   - CLP-FLT-06 (line 495): Same weak assertion.\n   \n   These assertions are effectively no-ops. They don't verify that the filter actually works. This is a violation of the writeTests.md guideline which says \"Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click\" and more generally the intent that tests should actually verify the behavior described in the test entry.\n\n10. **When adding data-testid attributes, plan ALL testid additions upfront** - N/A for test checking.\n\n11. **Never hardcode database IDs in tests** - Tests use `testId?.replace('client-row-', '')` to extract IDs from the DOM. OK.\n\n12. **Playwright config must use fullyParallel: true, do not set workers: 1** - Not checking config here.\n\nLooking at a few more cases, I'm noticing the same pattern across CLP-SRCH-03, CLP-SRCH-04, CLP-FLT-04, and CLP-FLT-06 — they all just check that row counts are greater than or equal to zero, which is always true and doesn't actually verify that the filtering or tagging behavior works as intended. These tests fail to demonstrate that clients with specific tags are shown or excluded appropriately, which directly contradicts the writeTests.md requirement that tests verify the described behavior. the filtering behavior. Looking at CLP-TBL-05, the test iterates through rows checking for Individual type clients and verifying they show \"(Self)\" as the primary contact, but it breaks after finding the first match—so if no Individual type exists on the current page, the test passes without actually validating anything.\n\nThe `textContent()` calls inside the loop are fine since the elements are already rendered, so this isn't a directive violation per se. But CLP-TBL-06 and CLP-TBL-07 follow the same pattern where tests can pass without checking anything if no matching row is found.\n\nLooking at the violations across all three jobs: Job 1 has none, Job 2 has only a minor issue with `mb-6` on the ClientsPageHeader root, and Job 3 is where the actual concerns are.\n\nI'm finding several tests with weak assertions that don't properly verify filtering behavior—they just check conditions that are always true. More critically, some tests are using `count()` inside `.toPass()` blocks, which directly violates the directive's prohibition on auto-wait locator calls in those contexts.\n\nLet me reconsider the directive more carefully though. It warns against iterating over dynamic elements where the DOM might change mid-loop, causing deadlocks. The `count()` calls here aren't iterating—they're just getting a single count and asserting on it. That said, the directive is broader: it says to keep `.toPass()` blocks free of any Playwright auto-waiting calls that could block indefinitely, and to use locator chaining with single-assertion matchers like `.toHaveCount()` instead.\n\nSo I need to flag violations where `count()` is used inside `.toPass()`, even if they're not technically iterating. I'm also identifying weak filter tests where assertions like `rowCount >= 0` always pass and don't actually verify the filter behavior. Let me compile the specific violations to report.\n\nI'm thinking about how to organize these findings into fix groups. The weak filter assertions and the `.toPass()` with `count()` issues are related—they're both about improper assertion patterns in the same test file. I could group them separately since they require different fixes, or combine them under a broader \"assertion pattern\" category. Let me create two distinct fix groups to keep the remediation focused.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider whether using `count()` inside `.toPass()` truly violates the directive. Looking at the examples provided, I see the pattern that's being flagged as problematic involves looping through DOM elements after counting them, which can cause hangs if the DOM changes. Let me examine whether the specific case I found matches that violation pattern. I see the issue now—the current approach in CLP-TBL-08 gets counts but doesn't actually iterate, so it technically follows the directive, but the refactored version is cleaner by using locator filters to verify the churned status directly without needing intermediate count variables.\n\nI'm identifying the key violations across the test file: weak filter assertions that don't properly verify filtering behavior, and the `.toPass()` blocks with `count()` calls that should be replaced with atomic Playwright assertions. I can group these into a single fix targeting the clients-list-page tests, then verify the tests pass afterward. For any violations I find, I'll add a fix group using `add-group` rather than fixing them immediately.\n\nI'm thinking about whether to create two separate groups—one for weak test assertions and another for the `.toPass()` patterns—or consolidate them since they're in the same file and stem from the same root cause of improper assertion patterns. I'll go with a single group.\n\nLooking back at the CLP-FLT-08 test, I see it's using `allTextContents()` inside `.toPass()`. Since `allTextContents()` returns immediately without auto-waiting, it doesn't pose a deadlock risk and aligns with the directive's intent. There's also no practical alternative for atomic sorting verification, so this pattern is acceptable.\n\nNow I need to document my findings and set up the fix groups, but let me double-check the CLP-TBL-08 test one more time to see what comes after the `.toPass()` block. I'm noticing a pattern across several tests where they iterate through rows looking for specific data, but if the data doesn't exist on the first page, the test passes without actually verifying anything. Tests CLP-TBL-05, CLP-TBL-06, and CLP-TBL-07 all follow this same structure—they're not technically violations, but they're weak tests that might give false confidence depending on what data is present.\n\nThe real issue is that these tests depend on specific seed data (Individual type clients, clients with 0 deals, tasks scheduled in certain ways), but the test spec doesn't instruct them to create those records upfront. The tests should either set up their own data in beforeAll or beforeEach, or they need to reliably find what they're looking for in the existing seed data.\n\nSo the main violations I'm seeing are the

All components have appropriate data-testid attributes, use custom FilterSelect instead of native `<select>` elements, the Sidebar has no duplicate navigation links, and the components properly implement the test entry requirements.\n\n\nFor Job 3 (CheckTestsClientsListPage): I found several violations—weak assertions in multiple test cases that check `rowCount >= 0` instead of actually validating the filter behavior, and improper use of `.toPass()` blocks containing `count()` calls in a few tests, both of which violate the requirements.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":18049,"cache_read_input_tokens":92957,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":18049,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c0887ab5-d440-4b4c-8f52-4216f205687e","uuid":"2c58cb29-aed5-436e-aa07-6f4f4ea0bc61"}
