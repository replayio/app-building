There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c13c4b8f-3c42-43a5-a16c-af52f9486286","uuid":"73cfef2a-9da1-451d-a29f-02e3e6be68c1","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":138,"startLine":1,"totalLines":138}}}

Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":152,"startLine":1,"totalLines":152}}}

This could be a violation of the directive \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\" since there should be test entries for this page.\n\n\n2. **CheckComponentsClientDetail**: Check writeApp.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage components\n   - I need to examine the ClientDetailPage component and any sub-components for writeApp.md directive violations.\n3. **CheckTestsClientDetail**: Check writeTests.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage tests\n   - I need to verify whether tests exist for ClientDetailPage.\n\nLet me start by reviewing the AppSpec.md and the ClientDetailPage component to understand what this page is supposed to do.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3048,"cache_read_input_tokens":35637,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3048,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c13c4b8f-3c42-43a5-a16c-af52f9486286","uuid":"8d9e6244-67c6-45cc-9070-fdaaa875973a"}

Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth).

Let me also look at what the mockup shows. The AppSpec says there's a mockup for ClientDetailPage. Let me check if it was downloaded already.\n\nLet me now systematically go through each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientDetail\n\nI need to check testSpec.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage test entries. The ClientDetailPage section in docs/tests.md (line 97-98) is completely empty - just the heading \"## ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\" with no test entries at all.\n\nLooking at the AppSpec, the ClientDetailPage has:\n- Top section: summary header with client name, type, status, tags, edit capability, quick actions\n\n\n- Source Info section\n- Tasks section\n- Deals section\n- Attachments section\n- People section\n- Timeline section\n\nThe testSpec.md directives require systematically inventorying every visible element in each mockup and specifying exact navigation targets or action results for every clickable element. The complete absence of test entries here is itself a violation—there's nothing to check because nothing exists.\n\nSo the approach is clear: I need to read the directives, examine what's being checked, identify violations, and add fix groups for them. In this case, the ClientDetailPage test section is empty, which means there are no test entries at all when there should be comprehensive coverage of all the page elements and interactions. So the ClientDetailPage component does exist as a stub with the required data-testid and padding, which means it's actually compliant with the directives even though the page spec is empty. I should just systematically check each job and report what I find rather than getting stuck on whether incomplete work counts as violations.","signature":"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

When fully built, components should be separate files. Currently N/A since it's a stub.\n\n2. **\"All components must include data-testid attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items\"** - The root div has `data-testid=\"client-detail-page\"`. OK for current stub state.\n\n3. **\"Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (p-6 max-sm:p-3)\"** - Present. No violation.\n\n4. **\"When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code\"** - There are no test entries for ClientDetailPage, and the component is just a stub. The AppSpec describes a rich multi-section page that is not implemented.\n\n5. **\"Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup\"** - The component is a stub, not matching the mockup at all.\n\n6. **Backend/frontend directive: \"If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions\"** - No backend for clients exists yet (only auth function exists). N/A.\n\n**Violation Summary**: The ClientDetailPage is a stub that doesn't implement any of the AppSpec functionality. Since there are no test entries yet (which the testSpec fix group will address), and the component needs to be fully built once test entries exist, I'll add a fix group for building the ClientDetailPage after test specs are written.\n\nThe test spec group was already added above. Once test entries exist, the writing jobs will naturally follow. However, the fact that this page is a stub is a clear gap. The appropriate fix is to build it after the test spec is written. Since the testSpec group was already queued, the natural next step would be writeApp jobs.
