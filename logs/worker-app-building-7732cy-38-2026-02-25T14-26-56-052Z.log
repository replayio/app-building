I'm also searching the git history for any commits related to SupplierTracker to understand its development context.\n\nI'm pulling recent git history to see what's been worked on, checking the current branches and latest commit, then finding all source files in the SupplierTracker directory across different file types while filtering out node_modules. Finally, I'm running the specific dashboard suppliers list test and logging the output.\n\nThe test failed because the NEON_PROJECT_ID environment variable wasn't set, and the tee command also had issues. I'm creating a logs directory to store test output, then checking what environment variables are actually available and whether there's a .env file configured. I'm also looking at the netlify configuration and any deployment.json files to understand the project setup.\n\nNow I'm checking all the .env files across the different apps, verifying the Neon API key exists, running the deploy script to create the Neon project, and then attempting to run the dashboard test again to see if it passes once everything is properly configured.\n\nAfter the initial test failure due to missing NEON_PROJECT_ID, I deployed the app and re-ran the three dashboard tests—suppliers list, upcoming orders, and quick actions—all of which passed successfully.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4505,"cache_read_input_tokens":51700,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4505,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f978c71d-d214-4136-bf53-a5de4dc5bf7e","uuid":"70e24f8e-4df8-446c-8be1-0162d1d76ea4"}

Now I'm searching for test files in the SupplierTracker directory to understand what tests exist, then running the deployment tests again which fails on a different element - the upcoming-orders-table isn't visible this time.\n7. I check the test results directory to see what happened, then run the deployment tests a third time and they finally pass.\n8. With the tests passing, I run the full check command to make sure everything is working correctly across the board.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4114,"cache_read_input_tokens":60846,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4114,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f978c71d-d214-4136-bf53-a5de4dc5bf7e","uuid":"baf74eec-cbcb-478f-b037-6d36299d6623"}
