There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other.

Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

Let me also look at the test files to understand what's currently tested.\n\nLet me now examine:\n1. Line 357: The \"saved transaction appears\" test says Rent Expense should show \"$1,350.00\" but the save test on line 350 specifies \"Rent Expense Debit $1,500.00\". So there's an inconsistency - the test saves $1,500.00 but expects $1,350.00 when viewing Rent Expense.\n\n2. Line 503: The \"prevents saving unbalanced\" test says \"either disabled or shows error\" - ambiguous. Looking at the code, the Save button is disabled (`disabled={!description.trim() || !isBalanced || submitting}`). \n\nThe Save Transaction button is disabled when the transaction isn't balanced.\n\n3. Line 508: The \"shows zero totals\" test says \"'Transaction is Balanced' (since $0.00 = $0.00) or a neutral state prompting the user to add line items\" - ambiguous.

This is inconsistent - it should be \"$1,500.00\".\n\n2. **Line 503 - Ambiguous \"either disabled or shows error\"**: The actual code (line 170) shows the Save button is `disabled={!description.trim() || !isBalanced || submitting}`. \n\n3. **Line 508 - Ambiguous \"or a neutral state\"**: The BalanceIndicator component always shows either \"Transaction is Balanced\" or \"Transaction is Unbalanced\" based on the `isBalanced` prop. When both debits and credits are $0.00, isBalanced evaluates to true, so it displays \"Transaction is Balanced\" with no neutral state in between. The test spec needs to be precise about this behavior instead of leaving it vague.\n\n4. **Missing backdrop close test**: The modal overlay has an onClick handler that triggers onClose, while the modal content itself stops propagation. This means clicking the backdrop will close the modal, and I need to add a test for this interaction.\n\nNow I'm going through the tests.md file to make these corrections. I should also double-check the \"saved transaction appears\" test scenario more carefully, particularly how the transaction flows through to the AccountDetailPage after being saved.\n\nLooking at that test, I notice there's an inconsistency in the expected amounts—the initial state mentions a Rent Expense debit of $1,500.00, but the expected result shows $1,350.00, which appears to be a typo that needs correcting to $1,500.00 for consistency.\n\nI should also review whether the test files themselves need updates to match any changes I'm making to the test documentation.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1276,"cache_read_input_tokens":37037,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1276,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e8590655-104e-4362-98af-5eba626131ee","uuid":"fb51740f-ad13-478a-a1d0-3a39ffbfea9f"}

Let me now fix the four violations in the tests.md file:\n\n1. **Line 357 - Amount mismatch**: Fix \"$1,350.00\" to \"$1,500.00\" for the Rent Expense amount in the \"saved transaction appears\" test.\n\n2. **Line 503 - Ambiguous \"either disabled or shows error\"**: The code shows `disabled={!description.trim() || !isBalanced || submitting}` - the button is disabled. I should change the spec to say exactly: \"The 'Save Transaction' button is disabled while the transaction is unbalanced.\"\n\n\n3. **Line 508 - Ambiguous \"or a neutral state\"**: The BalanceIndicator always shows either \"Transaction is Balanced\" or \"Transaction is Unbalanced\". When both amounts are $0.00, isBalanced evaluates to true, so it displays \"Transaction is Balanced\". I need to remove the ambiguous \"or a neutral state\" part.\n\n4. **Missing backdrop close test**: I should add a test for clicking the modal overlay to close it. The modal implementation has the overlay set up to trigger onClose when clicked, while the content itself stops propagation to prevent closing when clicking inside.\n\nNow I'm making the edits to address these issues.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7633,"cache_read_input_tokens":39967,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7633,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e8590655-104e-4362-98af-5eba626131ee","uuid":"89fe8d94-2234-4564-a18b-7a0d19627462"}
