[2026-02-26T23:49:54.009Z] Running task: 1 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md)
[2026-02-26T23:49:54.009Z]   - FixViolationDashboardAmbiguousNav: Fix ambiguous 'or opens a new transaction modal' navigation targets in DashboardPage test entries (lines 89 and 245 of docs/tests.md). Should consistently say 'navigates to /transactions/new (NewTransactionPage)' matching other pages.
