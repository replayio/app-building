This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

For example, **DLP-TBL-04** tests deal row navigation:\n```typescript\ntest('DLP-TBL-04: Clicking a deal row navigates to DealDetailPage', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/deals');\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n\n  const rows = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"deal-row-\"]');\n  const count = await rows.count();\n\n  if (count > 0) {\n    const rowTestId = await rows.first().getAttribute('data-testid');\n    const dealId = rowTestId!.replace('deal-row-', '');\n\n    await rows.first().click();\n    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n\n    await expect(page).toHaveURL(new RegExp(`/deals/${dealId}`));\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Key Test Coverage\n\nThe TLP-NAV tests verify:\n1. **TLP-NAV-01**: All sidebar navigation items (Clients, Deals, Tasks, Team, Settings) are visible on the tasks page, and the Tasks item is highlighted with an active state class (`bg-sidebar-active`)\n2. **TLP-NAV-02**: Each sidebar navigation link successfully routes to its corresponding page with correct URL patterns\n\nBoth tests use Playwright's `getByTestId` selectors and URL expectations for reliable navigation testing."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: accc930 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 43287\ntool_uses: 5\nduration_ms: 11398</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"00e7d9a8-a867-4ae9-9e0b-ead51f55f6bc","uuid":"a9633bc1-7be9-46ab-a7c8-f955de02b201","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Search in /repo/apps/SalesCRM for Playwright test files related to tasks page navigation (TLP-NAV).

Here are the relevant tests:\n\n### TLP-NAV Tests (Tasks List Page Navigation)\n\n**File Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/tasks-list-page.spec.ts`\n\n#### **TLP-NAV-01: Sidebar displays all navigation items with Tasks highlighted**\n```typescript\ntest('TLP-NAV-01: Sidebar displays all navigation items with Tasks highlighted', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/tasks');\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n\n  const sidebar = page.getByTestId('sidebar');\n  await expect(sidebar).toBeVisible();\n\n  // Verify all navigation items are present\n  await expect(sidebar.getByText('Clients')).toBeVisible();\n  await expect(sidebar.getByText('Deals')).toBeVisible();\n  await expect(sidebar.getByText('Tasks')).toBeVisible();\n  await expect(sidebar.getByText('Team')).toBeVisible();\n  await expect(sidebar.getByText('Settings')).toBeVisible();\n\n  // \"Tasks\" link should be visually highlighted as active\n  const tasksLink = page.getByTestId('sidebar-nav-tasks');\n  await expect(tasksLink).toHaveClass(/bg-sidebar-active/);\n});\n```\n\n#### **TLP-NAV-02: Sidebar navigation links route correctly from tasks page**\n```typescript\ntest('TLP-NAV-02: Sidebar navigation links route correctly from tasks page', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/tasks');\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n\n  // Click \"Clients\" in sidebar → navigates to /clients\n  await page.getByTestId('sidebar-nav-clients').click();\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/clients/);\n\n  // Click \"Deals\" → navigates to /deals\n  await page.getByTestId('sidebar-nav-deals').click();\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/deals/);\n\n  // Click \"Team\" → navigates to /users\n  await page.getByTestId('sidebar-nav-team').click();\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/users/);\n\n  // Click \"Settings\" → navigates to /settings\n  await page.getByTestId('sidebar-nav-settings').click();\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/settings/);\n\n  // Click \"Tasks\" → navigates back to /tasks\n  await page.getByTestId('sidebar-nav-tasks').click();\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/tasks/);\n});\n```\n\n### Related Deals Page Navigation\n\n**File Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deals-list-page.spec.ts`\n\nThe deals page also has similar navigation tests. For example, **DLP-TBL-04** tests deal row navigation:\n```typescript\ntest('DLP-TBL-04: Clicking a deal row navigates to DealDetailPage', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/deals');\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n\n  const rows = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"deal-row-\"]');\n  const count = await rows.count();\n\n  if (count > 0) {\n    const rowTestId = await rows.first().getAttribute('data-testid');\n    const dealId = rowTestId!.replace('deal-row-', '');\n\n    await rows.first().click();\n    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n\n    await expect(page).toHaveURL(new RegExp(`/deals/${dealId}`));\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Key Test Coverage\n\nThe TLP-NAV tests verify:\n1. **TLP-NAV-01**: All sidebar navigation items (Clients, Deals, Tasks, Team, Settings) are visible on the tasks page, and the Tasks item is highlighted with an active state class (`bg-sidebar-active`)\n2. **TLP-NAV-02**: Each sidebar navigation link successfully routes to its corresponding page with correct URL patterns\n\nBoth tests use Playwright's `getByTestId` selectors and URL expectations for reliable navigation testing."}],"totalDurationMs":11398,"totalTokens":43287,"totalToolUseCount":5,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":27102,"cache_read_input_tokens":15048,"output_tokens":1130,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":27102},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   211→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   212→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   213→\n   214→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   215→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   216→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   217→\n   218→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   219→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   220→\n   221→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   222→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   223→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   224→\n   225→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   226→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   227→\n   228→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   229→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   230→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   231→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   232→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   233→\n   234→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   235→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   236→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   237→\n   238→## Tips\n   239→\n   240→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   241→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   242→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   243→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   244→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   245→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   246→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   247→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   248→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   249→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   250→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   251→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   252→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   253→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   254→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   255→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   256→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   257→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   258→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   259→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   260→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   261→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   262→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   263→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   264→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   265→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   266→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   267→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   268→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   269→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   270→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   271→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   272→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   273→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   274→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   275→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   276→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   277→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   278→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   279→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   280→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   281→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"00e7d9a8-a867-4ae9-9e0b-ead51f55f6bc","uuid":"96801a9f-c647-4831-a601-04d617a17717","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial testing job into a single group:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a group to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":281,"startLine":1,"totalLines":281}}}

Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n","numLines":30,"startLine":30,"totalLines":163}}}

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Webhook Setup Guides section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: e4b5f26\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n\n2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: 837fc7f\n- After: 366203c\n- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n\n2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n- Before: edc5279\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n- Before: 0cd095c\n- After: 78daa0a\n- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior. Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n\n2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n- Before: 0301f38\n- After: 0cd095c\n- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":32,"oldLines":6,"newStart":32,"newLines":12,"lines":[" - Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode).
