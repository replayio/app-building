The issue is that `GROUPS` computed as 1001 rather than 38. Looking at my bash code, I think the problem is that the `GROUPS` calculation is off because it's treating single characters instead of lines. Let me check - `mapfile` should read lines... Wait, 1001 is very wrong for 378 logs with groups of 10. Something went wrong.\n\nActually wait - looking at the output more carefully, the truncated output says \"Groups: 1001\" which doesn't make sense. 378 / 10 = 37.8, so ceil = 38.\n \nNow I'm seeing the queue has 146 tasks when it should have around 38, and the process timed out partway through. The arithmetic in the grouping calculation is definitely wrong - either `mapfile` isn't reading the 378 lines correctly, or the ceiling division formula is broken. Let me recalculate: 378 lines divided into groups of 10 should give 38 groups, not 1001.\n\nI need to stop this background task, clear out the bogus queue entries, and rewrite the script more carefully to verify that `TOTAL` is actually counting lines and not something else like characters.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11225,"cache_read_input_tokens":40743,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11225,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3d25b697-dd4c-465b-b778-0cc051baf4d5","uuid":"5dc22cd2-d5f7-4e87-9e64-7cce546a85b7"}

The `mapfile` command is bash-specific. Let me check what shell is used.\n\nActually the debug output shows mapfile works fine with 378 entries. Let me check if the issue is with the `$(( ))` expansion.\n \nThe \"Groups: 1001\" discrepancy suggests there's something off with the variable expansion or the shell environment.
