There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

Let me systematically check each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecTasksListPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in TasksListPage test entries\n\nI need to check the test entries in `docs/tests.md` (section 7: TasksListPage) against the directives in `testSpec.md`.\n\n### testSpec.md Directives:\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler elements just because they're easier to build — if the mockup shows specific columns with joins or computed values, test all of them, and if there are four filter controls shown, test all four rather than cutting corners.\n4. Every clickable element needs a test entry that specifies exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers, with no ambiguity about destinations. For buttons that open external flows like OAuth or payments, document how the flow launches and what the completion state looks like.\n5. Any user action that changes data needs corresponding test entries covering persistence and side effects — like verifying that history entries are created exactly once, not duplicated.\n6. Button appearance matters too: if the mockup specifies particular text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that exact appearance rather than just confirming a button exists.\n7. Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they function correctly.\n8. File uploads should be supported in attachment functionality unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must clearly document the expected data format and accepted values before users attempt the import, and tests should verify this documentation is visible.\n10. Any backend integrations the user can configure — webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps — need complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n11. State-changing actions require test coverage.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test entries for the TasksListPage section to see how well they align with these directives. Looking at the navigation tests, TLP-NAV-01 checks that Tasks is highlighted in the sidebar, which covers the appearance requirement. TLP-NAV-02 tests the routing for each sidebar item, but I'm noticing some inconsistency — the test mentions Clients, Deals, Team, Settings, and Tasks, yet the Components section references \"Contacts\" for other pages. I need to check whether this navigation structure is consistent across the different page tests. I'm noticing that the Contacts navigation link is missing from the TasksListPage tests, which violates the directive to systematically inventory every visible element. Looking at the PageHeader tests, TLP-HDR-02 mentions an optional deal dropdown in the create modal but I need to verify if the tests actually exercise that field, and TLP-HDR-03 checks for task persistence but doesn't seem to validate whether timeline or history entries are created as a side effect.\n\nFor the remaining PageHeader tests, the cancel button and import functionality are covered, including CSV format validation and task creation from imports. The FilterBar tests comprehensively cover all filter controls—priority, text search, assignee, client filtering, and the ability to clear filters.\n\nNow I'm checking the TaskCards tests to ensure they cover the required display elements. The cards need to show priority badges with proper colors, task titles, due dates, assignee information with avatars, and action menus. I'm verifying that TLP-CRD-01 properly tests the assignee avatar display alongside the name and role, which it does based on the test description mentioning \"Sarah J. (PM)\" with the avatar. Priority badge colors are tested separately, task ordering is covered, and I need to see what else is being validated for the card component. -04**: Click navigates to detail ✅ Covers directive #4. The expected says: \"Navigates to /tasks/:taskId. Task detail page shows task title, description, priority, due date, assignee, status, and notes section.\" This is good - specifies exact navigation target.\n- **TLP-CRD-05**: Action menu options ✅ Covers directive #2.\n- **TLP-CRD-06**: Mark Complete removes task ✅ Covers directive #5 (persistence + side effects). It says \"Timeline entry created on associated client.\" Good.\n- **TLP-CRD-07**: Edit opens edit form ✅ Covers directive #7.\n- **TLP-CRD-08**: Editing persists changes ✅ Covers directive #5.\n- **TLP-CRD-09**: Delete task after confirmation ✅ Covers directive #5 and #7.\n\nLooking at what might be missing or problematic, I notice the TasksListPage navigation is missing \"Contacts\" as a sidebar item, which other pages like ClientsListPage and ContactsListPage include—that's a directive #2 violation. Also, while TLP-CRD-06 mentions a timeline entry being created on the associated client, I should verify whether the test entry actually validates this cross-page side effect in sufficient detail.\n\nActually, let me reconsider TLP-CRD-08. It says the card updates with the new due date and the change persists, but it doesn't mention whether a timeline or history entry gets created for the edit. If the app tracks mutations with a timeline, then per directive #5, every data change should generate a history entry. I need to check whether the app design includes timeline tracking for task edits and whether the test entry should account for that.\n\nLooking at the DATA section, I see there are cross-page consistency tests like DATA-02 that verify task completion reflects across multiple pages. I also notice the Components list mentions a PageHeader with \"New Task\" button for the TasksListPage, but the test entries TLP-HDR-04 and TLP-HDR-05 reference Import functionality. The components list doesn't actually include an Import button, so there's a mismatch between what the tests expect and what's documented in the components.\n\nMore importantly, I'm spotting a navigation inconsistency: the ClientsListPage navigation includes \"Contacts\" in its sidebar links, but the TasksListPage navigation is missing it entirely. That's a significant discrepancy that violates the directive about consistent navigation across pages.\n\nI'm also noticing the FilterBar component description is vague compared to what the actual tests cover—the tests detail specific filters like priority, assignee, and client, but the component inventory just says \"Filter dropdown/icon and text filter input.\" These gaps suggest the spec isn't systematically inventorying every visible element as required. I'm confirming the three violations I found: the navigation sidebar missing Contacts, no routing test for the /contacts path, and the PageHeader components list not documenting the Import button even though tests exist for it. Now I need to move on to analyzing the next job.\n\nFor Job 2, I'm checking TasksListPage components against the writeApp.md directives—specifically verifying that test entries are satisfied by the app code, visual elements match the mockup specifications, all interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes, and the netlify configuration is set correctly for the monorepo structure.\n\nNow I need to examine the component files that make up TasksListPage: TasksPageHeader, TasksFilterBar, TaskCard, and the Create component to validate they meet these

[2026-02-20T22:12:46.346Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_015YWKBhP1svhiG2aj9rjGnK","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a thorough understanding of all the relevant files. Let me systematically go through all three jobs:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecTasksListPage\n\nChecking test entries against testSpec.md directives:\n\n### Directive 1: Consistent navigation/styling across pages\n- **TLP-NAV-01** lists \"Clients, Deals, Tasks, Team, Settings\" but the sidebar actually has 6 items: Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, Settings. **VIOLATION**: Missing \"Contacts\" in the navigation test entry.\n- **TLP-NAV-02** tests navigation to Clients, Deals, Team, Settings, Tasks but not Contacts. \n- **VIOLATION**: Missing \"Contacts\" → /contacts navigation test.\n\n### Directive 2: Systematically inventory every visible element\n- **PageHeader Components** description says: \"PageHeader: 'Upcoming Tasks' title with 'New Task' button (accent/primary styled)\". But the actual component also has an Import button. **VIOLATION**: The components description is missing the Import button.\n- The test entries for the Import button do exist (TLP-HDR-04, TLP-HDR-05), so the test entries themselves are complete, but the component description is incomplete.\n\n### Directive 3: Don't substitute easier-to-implement elements\n- No violations found.\n\n### Directive 4: Every clickable element must specify exact navigation target or action result\n- Entries look good here.\n\n### Directive 5: Data mutation entries must verify persistence and side effects\n- Mark Complete creates a timeline entry on the associated client as expected. For editing tasks, the backend only creates timeline events on completion, not on regular edits, so the test entry correctly reflects that no timeline entry is created. Delete operations persist the deletion and remove the task from both the task list and associated client.\n\n### Directive 6: Button and control appearance matters\n- Entries seem to test for button appearance (e.g., \"blue/accent colored\", \"red High priority badge\").\n\n### Directive 7: Completely test modal dialogs\n- Create task modal: tested in TLP-HDR-02 (fields), TLP-HDR-03 (create), TLP-HDR-06 (cancel). ✅\n- Edit task modal: tested in TLP-CRD-07 (opens with pre-filled), TLP-CRD-08 (editing persists). ✅\n- Delete confirmation dialog: tested in TLP-CRD-09. ✅\n- Import dialog: tested in TLP-HDR-04, TLP-HDR-05. ✅\n\n### Directive 8: Attachment functionality\n- Not applicable to tasks list page.\n\n### Directive 9: Import dialogs must specify expected data format\n- TLP-HDR-04 confirms the CSV format specification table is present with required 'Title' column documented. ✅\n\n### Directive 10: Backend integrations setup instructions\n- Not applicable to tasks list page.\n\n### Directive 11: State-changing actions must have tests for cross-app updates\n- TLP-CRD-06 verifies that timeline entries are created on the associated client when tasks change. ✅\n- TLP-CRD-09 confirms deletions properly remove entries from both the client and deal records. ✅\n\nI've identified two key violations in Job 1: the navigation components are missing a \"Contacts\" link, and the PageHeader description doesn't mention the Import button. Now I'm moving through Job 2 to verify the CheckComponentsTasksListPage against the directives—the components appear to align well with test requirements, use appropriate styling and layouts, and I'm checking that all interactive elements have the necessary data-testid attributes.\n\nVerifying test IDs across TasksPageHeader, TasksFilterBar, and TaskCard components...\n\nNow checking the modal components—CreateTaskModal and EditTaskModal both have comprehensive test IDs covering all form fields, buttons, and interactive elements.\n\nFor TaskPriorityBadge, I'm verifying the dynamic test ID pattern works correctly with the priority value. Moving on to verify the Neon database queries are using proper tagged template literal syntax throughout the tasks.ts file, and confirming that empty strings are being converted to null for date and UUID columns in both POST and PUT handlers.\n\nNow I'm checking the Netlify Functions path parsing logic to ensure the task ID is being extracted from the correct index after splitting and filtering the URL path. I'm verifying the remaining directives are met across the modals and components, and everything checks out so far. But I should take another look at the TaskCard component—specifically whether the assignee display with avatar, name, and role is actually visible on all screen sizes, since I'm noticing it has a `max-md:hidden` class that might be hiding it on smaller screens.\n\nLooking more closely at the due date handling, there's a desktop version with one test ID that's hidden on small screens, and a separate mobile version with a different test ID that only shows on small screens. This means the test looking for the desktop due date ID would fail on mobile viewports since that element isn't rendered there.\n\nNow I'm checking the neon driver directive requirements more carefully. The code needs to use tagged template literal syntax for all SQL calls, and I'm verifying that's consistently applied throughout the tasks.ts file. I'm also double-checking the null coercion for DATE columns—the directive specifies using `||` instead of `??` to convert empty strings to null, and I can see the POST handler is correctly using `||` for the due_date, client_id, and deal_id fields.\n\nLooking at the PUT and Import handlers, they're also properly using `||` for due_date handling. For other fields like description, priority, assignee_name, and assignee_role that are text columns rather than DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID types, using `??` is acceptable since the directive only applies to those specific column types.\n\nNow checking the test file against the writeTests.md directives. Navigation tests are properly verifying exact URLs with regex patterns, and side effects like task completion are being checked—though I notice the Mark Complete test verifies the task disappears from the list but doesn't confirm the timeline entry creation. ('heading', { name: 'Upcoming Tasks' })` ✅ \n- TLP-HDR-02: Uses `modal.getByText('Title *')`, `modal.getByText('Description')`, etc. These are scoped to the modal, so should be fine. Though \"Description\" and \"Priority\" are common words... but since they're scoped to the modal element, this should be OK.\n- TLP-HDR-04: `dialog.getByText('Import Tasks')` - scoped to dialog. ✅\n- TLP-NAV-01: `sidebar.getByText('Clients')`, `sidebar.getByText('Deals')`, etc. - scoped to sidebar. ✅\n\nNow I'm checking whether the testid values are consistent across the spec files.\n\nFor the file upload tests, TLP-HDR-05 is using the proper file upload mechanics with Buffer content. Looking at the Playwright locator usage, I found an issue in TLP-FLT-02 where there's a test that's querying the DOM inside an expect().toPass() block, which violates the pattern of keeping locator calls outside of retry logic. I'm seeing that the directive specifically recommends using atomic assertions like `.toHaveCount()` and `.toContainText()` instead of auto-waiting calls, so the `.count()` and `.textContent()` calls in the `.toPass()` block are violations. Looking at the other test cases, TLP-FLT-03 uses these auto-waiting calls outside of retry blocks in a conditional flow which is fragile but not necessarily a violation, while TLP-FLT-04 mixes `.all()` and `.textContent()` with atomic assertions afterward. TLP-CRD-03 uses `.count()` and `.textContent()` in a loop outside `.toPass()`, which could be problematic if the DOM changes, but since there's no retry mechanism it aligns with the directive.\n\nLooking at Directive 8 about testing exact fields from the spec, TLP-CRD-08 has a clear violation—the spec requires testing due date changes, but the test is modifying the title instead. Let me check the actual test code to confirm what's being tested. I'm noticing the test does track counts across filtering and restoration within a single test, so that should be safe from cross-test interference. But I'm also spotting several other violations: TLP-FLT-02 uses `.toPass()` with nested auto-waiting which breaks the directive, TLP-CRD-08 changes the title instead of the due date as the spec requires, and TLP-CRD-06 doesn't verify the timeline entry on the associated client. I should also check whether TLP-CRD-09 actually confirms the task disappears from both the associated client and deal, not just from the tasks list itself.\n\nLooking closer at TLP-CRD-09, the test only verifies the task card is gone from the list but never navigates to the client or deal page to confirm it's removed there too. The spec explicitly requires checking that it \"no longer appears on associated client or deal,\" so that's a clear violation of the side effects verification directive. Even though the DELETE handler doesn't create a timeline entry, the test still needs to validate the data consistency across related records. TLP-FLT-02 violates the auto-waiting directive by using `.count()` inside `.toPass()`, while TLP-CRD-06 and TLP-CRD-09 both fail to verify the side effects specified in their test entries—the timeline entry creation and the deletion visibility across pages respectively. TLP-CRD-08 is testing the wrong field entirely, changing the title instead of the due date as the spec requires. Now I'm organizing these violations by category to plan the fixes. I'm reconsidering whether all of these are actual violations or just minor issues. TLP-CRD-06 and TLP-CRD-09 require verifying side effects across pages, which adds complexity and potential flakiness, but the test spec explicitly calls for these assertions, so I need to include them in the
