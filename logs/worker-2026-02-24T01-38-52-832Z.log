Let me now look at the existing test entries for other similar pages (ForgotPasswordPage and ResetPasswordPage) to understand the format and level of detail expected. I already have those in the tests.md file.\n\nLet me also check the existing tests for ConfirmEmailPage to see what's already there. The tests.md ends at line 1049 with just the header:\n\n```\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n```\n\nAnd that's it - no test entries.\n\nNow let me look at how the component works:\n\n1. **Loading state with token**: When navigating to `/auth/confirm-email?token=sometoken`, the component shows \"Confirming your email...\" while the API request is in progress.\n\n\n2. **Successful confirmation**: On API success, it displays \"Email confirmed! Redirecting...\" and navigates to `/clients` after 2 seconds, storing any returned token in localStorage for auto-login.\n3. **Missing token error**: If no token query param is provided, it immediately shows \"No confirmation token provided\".\n4. **Invalid/expired token error**: When the API returns an error, it displays the error message from the response (like \"Invalid or expired token\").\n5. **Network error**: If the API call fails due to network issues, it shows \"Network error\".\n6. **Auto-login after confirmation**: If the response includes a token, it gets stored in localStorage to automatically log the user in.\n\nI'm noticing the backend actually returns just a success message without a token, so there's a gap between what the frontend is prepared to handle and what the backend currently provides. The job description mentions auto-login after confirmation, but based on the actual component behavior, I should focus the test spec on what's really happening rather than what might be intended.\n\nNow I need to match the existing test format from ForgotPasswordPage and ResetPasswordPage to write the ConfirmEmailPage entries consistently.\n\nWriting test entries for

Other links have the default transparent background.\n\n#### Active link updates on sub-routes\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /clients/123 (a client detail page).\n- **Expected:** The \"Clients\" link in the sidebar is highlighted as the active link, since the route is a sub-route of /clients.\n\n#### Sidebar is persistent across all pages\n- **Initial state:** User navigates between different pages (Clients, Deals, Tasks, etc.).\n- **Expected:** The sidebar remains visible and in the same position on every page. The sidebar width is consistent (approximately 244px). Navigation links remain functional throughout.\n\n### SidebarUserArea\n\n#### Sign In button shown when not logged in\n- **Initial state:** User is not authenticated (no active session).\n- **Expected:** The sidebar user area (below the app title) displays a \"Sign In\" button. No avatar, user name, or sign-out option is visible.\n\n#### Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form\n- **Initial state:** User is not authenticated.

On failure (invalid credentials), an error message is displayed inline near the form.\n\n#### Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password\n- **Initial state:** The inline auth form is open in Sign In mode.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Forgot password?\" link.\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /auth/forgot-password, displaying the ForgotPasswordPage where the user can enter their email to receive a password reset link.\n\n#### Toggle switches between Sign In and Sign Up modes\n- **Initial state:** The inline auth form is open in Sign In mode.\n- **Action:** User clicks the Sign In/Sign Up toggle.\n- **Expected:** The form switches to Sign Up mode. The submit button text changes to \"Sign Up\". The toggle text updates to indicate the user can switch back to Sign In mode. A Name input field appears (not present in Sign In mode). The email and password fields remain visible.\n\n#### Sign Up form submits and requires email confirmation\n- **Initial state:** The inline auth form is open in Sign Up mode.\n- **Action:** User enters a name, a new email, and password and clicks the \"Sign Up\" submit button.\n- **Expected:** The form submits the registration. A message is displayed informing the user that a confirmation email has been sent and they must confirm their email before logging in. The user is not yet authenticated. (In test mode with IS_TEST=true, signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.)\n\n#### Logged in state shows avatar, name, and sign-out\n- **Initial state:** User is authenticated with an active session.\n- **Expected:** The sidebar user area displays the user's avatar (or initials), the user's display name, and a sign-out button or icon. The \"Sign In\" button is not visible.\n\n#### Clicking sign-out logs the user out\n- **Initial state:** User is authenticated. The sidebar shows avatar, name, and sign-out.\n- **Action:** User clicks the sign-out button.\n- **Expected:** The user's session is ended. The sidebar user area reverts to showing the \"Sign In\" button. The avatar and name are no longer displayed. The app continues to function in unauthenticated mode (all pages remain accessible).\n\n## ClientsListPage (/clients)\n\n## ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n\n## PersonDetailPage (/individuals/:individualId)\n\n## DealsListPage (/deals)\n\n## DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)\n\n## TasksListPage (/tasks)\n\nComponents: TasksFilterBar, TaskCard, CreateTaskModal, TasksListContent\n\n### TasksFilterBar\n\n#### Search input filters tasks by title\n- **Initial state:** TasksListPage is loaded with multiple tasks visible (e.g., \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\", \"Review Client Proposal Draft\", \"Update Team Documentation\").\n- **Action:** User types \"Marketing\" into the search input (placeholder text \"Filter...\").\n- **Expected:** The task list updates to show only tasks whose title contains \"Marketing\" (e.g., \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\"). Tasks that do not match are hidden. The search is case-insensitive and debounced.\n\n#### Search input clears and shows all tasks\n- **Initial state:** The search input contains \"Marketing\" and only matching tasks are shown.\n- **Action:** User clears the search input.\n- **Expected:** All tasks are displayed again without any title filter applied.\n\n#### Priority filter dropdown filters by priority level\n- **Initial state:** TasksListPage is loaded with tasks of varying priorities (High, Medium, Low, Normal).\n- **Action:** User clicks the filter dropdown icon (filter icon with chevron) and selects \"High\" from the priority filter options.\n- **Expected:** The task list updates to show only tasks with \"High\" priority. The priority filter selection is visually indicated in the filter bar. Tasks with Medium, Low, and Normal priorities are hidden.\n\n#### Priority filter can be cleared to show all priorities\n- **Initial state:** The priority filter is set to \"High\", showing only high-priority tasks.\n- **Action:** User opens the priority filter dropdown and selects the \"All\" or clears the priority filter.\n- **Expected:** All tasks are displayed regardless of priority. The filter bar returns to its default unfiltered state.\n\n#### Status filter dropdown filters by task status\n- **Initial state:** TasksListPage is loaded with tasks having different statuses (open, completed, cancelled).\n- **Action:** User opens the filter dropdown and selects \"Completed\" from the status filter options.\n- **Expected:** The task list updates to show only tasks with \"Completed\" status. Open and cancelled tasks are hidden.\n\n#### Status filter shows open tasks by default\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /tasks.\n- **Expected:** The status filter defaults to showing \"Open\" tasks (upcoming/active tasks). Completed and cancelled tasks are not shown unless the user changes the filter.\n\n#### Multiple filters can be combined\n- **Initial state:** TasksListPage is loaded with tasks of varying priorities and statuses.\n- **Action:** User sets the priority filter to \"High\" and types \"Plan\" in the search input.\n- **Expected:** Only tasks matching both criteria are shown (high priority AND title containing \"Plan\"). Changing either filter updates the results immediately.\n\n### TaskCard\n\n#### Task card displays priority badge with correct color\n- **Initial state:** TasksListPage is loaded with tasks of different priorities.\n- **Expected:** Each task card displays a priority badge to the left of the title. The badge shows the priority text and is color-coded: \"High\" has a red/coral background, \"Medium\" has a yellow/amber background, \"Low\" has a green background, and \"Normal\" has a teal/blue-green background.\n\n#### Task card displays task title\n- **Initial state:** TasksListPage is loaded with tasks.\n- **Expected:** Each task card displays the task title as prominent text to the right of the priority badge (e.g., \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\", \"Review Client Proposal Draft\"). The title is the primary readable element on the card.\n\n#### Task card displays formatted due date\n- **Initial state:** TasksListPage is loaded with tasks that have various due dates.\n- **Expected:** Each task card displays the due date prefixed with \"Due:\" (e.g., \"Due: Today, 5:00 PM\", \"Due: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM\", \"Due: Oct 25, 2024\").
