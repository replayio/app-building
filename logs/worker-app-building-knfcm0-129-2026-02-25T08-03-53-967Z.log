Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f851784f-ea1a-4971-99d0-9c9947568e39","uuid":"7dcf511c-e0d6-4762-94cc-5b2d8785a382","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Each account / material can be further subdivided into batches where the amount of material in each batch is tracked separately.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f851784f-ea1a-4971-99d0-9c9947568e39","uuid":"52a3d2cd-4a1e-4bbf-979f-3f2ec6e5b346","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

Let me analyze the existing components against the test specs:\n\n1. **LowInventoryAlerts** - The existing component looks good. It has:\n   - data-testid attributes\n   - Section header with warning icon and \"Low Inventory Alerts\" heading\n   - Empty state with message \"No low inventory alerts\"\n   - Table with Severity, Material, Current Qty, Reorder Point, Actions columns\n   - Each alert has severity badge (warning/critical), material name, quantity, reorder point\n   - View Details link navigates to material detail page\n   - Dismiss button\n   - Reorder button that navigates to the new transaction page with the material pre-filled\n\n2. **MaterialsCategoriesOverview** - The existing component looks good. It has:\n   - Section header with icon and \"Materials Categories Overview\" heading\n   - Category columns showing category name, total items, total quantity\n   - Material links with name, quantity, and unit\n   - \"View All Categories\" link at the bottom\n\n3. **RecentTransactionsTable** - The existing component looks good. It has:\n   - Section header with \"Recent Transactions\" heading\n   - Table with Date, Reference, Accounts Affected, Materials & Amounts, Action columns\n   - Transaction rows with data\n   - \"View Full Details >\" link\n   - \"View All Transactions\" link at the bottom\n   - Empty state handling\n\n4. **DashboardPage** - The existing page looks good. It has:\n   - Dashboard title and New Transaction button\n   - DateRangeFilter and CategoryFilter\n   - All three dashboard widgets (LowInventoryAlerts, MaterialsCategoriesOverview, RecentTransactionsTable)\n   - Loading state\n\nNow I'm checking the dashboardSlice more carefully to see if there are any issues. Looking at how the pending action handles the loading state and clears recent transactions while preserving category overviews if they already exist.\n\nI notice the pending handler is clearing recentTransactions on every refetch, which would cause the UI to flash empty during refetches. The guidance says to avoid showing loading indicators during refetches when data already exists. The loading check is correct—it only sets loading when categoryOverviews is empty—but clearing recentTransactions on every pending request is problematic. I need to fix that.\n\nNow let me review the test requirements more carefully against each component to make sure everything is covered.\n\nFor LowInventoryAlerts, I'm checking off the warning triangle icon on the header, severity icons per row, severity labels, material details with units, the View Details link, and both Dismiss and Reorder buttons, plus the empty state. For MaterialsCategoriesOverview, the heading, icon, category columns showing name and totals, material links, and the View All Categories link are all there. For RecentTransactionsTable, I'm verifying the heading, the five columns, and the View Full Details link.\n\nNow I'm checking the DashboardPage itself—the title, New Transaction button, filters for date range and category, and the three widgets are all in place. Everything's looking solid. I'm also spotting a potential issue where resetting recent transactions to an empty array during pending state would cause the table to flash empty on refetches, and I'm confirming the page layout has the right padding classes and that interactive elements have their test IDs properly set.\n\nVerifying test IDs across the alerts and categories sections... I've verified all the test IDs are in place across the categories and recent transactions sections. Now I'm diving into the dashboard slice to investigate the `recentTransactions = []` issue, particularly looking at how the pending handler manages the state when data is being fetched.\n\nI'm seeing the problem—the pending handler clears `recentTransactions` on every fetch, which would cause the empty state message to flash briefly during refetches even when data already exists. According to the directive, I should only show loading states on initial loads when there's no data yet, not during refetches. I need to add a check to only set `loading = true` and clear transactions if the array is already empty. is fixing the `recentTransactions` clearing issue in the dashboard slice, and then verifying that all the components have the correct test IDs. I'm checking through the LowInventoryAlerts component now to make sure it has all the required data-testid attributes that the tests expect. Finishing up the test IDs for the dismiss and reorder buttons, then moving on to verify the MaterialsCategoriesOverview component has all its test identifiers in place for the category columns and material listings. I've verified all the test IDs are in place for the RecentTransactionsTable component, including the empty state and view all link. Now I need to resolve that `recentTransactions = []` issue in the slice and ensure everything compiles. Let me also cross-check the visual layout against the spec to make sure the header and navigation match what's expected. I'm spotting a bug in the dashboard slice where `recentTransactions` gets cleared every time data is fetched, causing an unnecessary flash of empty state while new data loads. Let me fix that and run the type check to validate
