Each group will include checks for testSpec.md directive violations and component compliance. I'm going back and forth on whether to include all pages or just the ones with actual content to check. The practical approach is to add groups for every page listed in tests.md—the checking jobs will simply skip over empty pages without finding anything to validate, so there's no harm in being comprehensive. I need to add job groups for each page, but I should be strategic about the order since they get added to the front of the queue. Let me work through this systematically - I'll add them in reverse order so they end up in the correct sequence when processed. Even for pages without test entries in the documentation, the component and test checking jobs can still run, so I should include all of them. I'll use the `--trailing` flag to add all the job groups in order after the existing
