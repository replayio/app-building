Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks.

Based on this assessment, the wizard either (a) rejects the request, displaying a clear rejection message and a reason for rejection, or (b) accepts the request, queues the app for autonomous building, and then shows a confirmation screen with a link to the new app’s AppPage where the user can monitor its progress. The layout should guide the user step-by-step, indicate progress through the wizard, handle validation errors, and clearly communicate the outcome of the assessment.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kds5EP7hTtGH82bSwipudoBvMJrNqh1kgO3jVR\n    17→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01BzPnAk8AL5UpATrKFaZzfD","session_id":"2a2514ba-2376-4455-a1a2-9b5b284e9daa","uuid":"24bde3f8-5967-45be-a265-18453067b5df"}

See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2.

Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions.

Now let me create a comprehensive summary document of all the information I've gathered:\n\n## LoopBuilder Frontend - Complete Architecture Overview\n\nI've explored the LoopBuilder frontend extensively. Here's the complete analysis:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Main App Entry Point** (`src/main.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport { store } from './store/store'\nimport App from './App'\nimport './index.css'\n\nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <Provider store={store}>\n      <BrowserRouter>\n        <App />\n      </BrowserRouter>\n    </Provider>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n)\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Redux store is wrapped via Provider\n- React Router BrowserRouter enables routing\n- StrictMode for development warnings\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Main App Router** (`src/App.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport MainPage from './pages/MainPage'\nimport AppPage from './pages/AppPage'\nimport RequestPage from './pages/RequestPage'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Routes>\n      <Route path=\"/\" element={<MainPage />} />\n      <Route path=\"/apps/:id\" element={<AppPage />} />\n      <Route path=\"/request\" element={<RequestPage />} />\n    </Routes>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\n**Routes:**\n- `/` → MainPage (dashboard with app list)\n- `/apps/:id` → AppPage (app details, activity log)\n- `/request` → RequestPage (wizard for requesting new apps)\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Page Components**\n\n### 3.1 **MainPage** (`src/pages/MainPage.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from '../store/hooks'\nimport { fetchApps } from '../store/appsSlice'\nimport StatusFilter from '../components/StatusFilter'\nimport RequestAppCTA from '../components/RequestAppCTA'\nimport AppCardGrid from '../components/AppCardGrid'\nimport './MainPage.css'\n\nfunction MainPage() {\n  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()\n  const loading = useAppSelector((state) => state.apps.loading)\n  const error = useAppSelector((state) => state.apps.error)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    dispatch(fetchApps())\n  }, [dispatch])\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"main-page\" data-testid=\"main-page\">\n      <StatusFilter />\n      <RequestAppCTA />\n      {loading ? (\n        <div data-testid=\"main-page-loading\" style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '48px 0', color: 'var(--color-text-muted)' }}>\n          Loading apps...\n        </div>\n      ) : error ? (\n        <div data-testid=\"main-page-error\" style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '48px 0', color: 'var(--color-rejected)' }}>\n          {error}\n        </div>\n      ) : (\n        <AppCardGrid />\n      )}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MainPage\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Fetches apps on mount\n- Shows loading/error states\n- Renders filtered app grid\n- Includes status filter tabs and CTA button\n\n### 3.2 **AppPage** (`src/pages/AppPage.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'\nimport { useParams, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport { ArrowLeft } from 'lucide-react'\nimport { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from '../store/hooks'\nimport { fetchAppById } from '../store/appsSlice'\nimport { fetchActivity, clearActivity } from '../store/activitySlice'\nimport AppHeader from '../components/AppHeader'\nimport AppActions from '../components/AppActions'\nimport ActivityLog from '../components/ActivityLog'\nimport './AppPage.css'\n\nconst POLL_INTERVAL = 5000\n\nfunction AppPage() {\n  const { id } = useParams<{ id: string }>()\n  const navigate = useNavigate()\n  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()\n\n  const app = useAppSelector((state) => state.apps.items.find((a) => a.id === id))\n  const activityEntries = useAppSelector((state) => state.activity.entries)\n  const activityLoading = useAppSelector((state) => state.activity.loading)\n  const activityError = useAppSelector((state) => state.activity.error)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (id) {\n      dispatch(fetchAppById(id))\n      dispatch(fetchActivity(id))\n    }\n    return () => {\n      dispatch(clearActivity())\n    }\n  }, [dispatch, id])\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!id || !app || app.status !== 'building') return\n\n    const interval = setInterval(() => {\n      dispatch(fetchAppById(id))\n      dispatch(fetchActivity(id))\n    }, POLL_INTERVAL)\n\n    return () => clearInterval(interval)\n  }, [dispatch, id, app?.status])\n\n  const handleRefresh = useCallback(() => {\n    if (id) {\n      dispatch(fetchAppById(id))\n      dispatch(fetchActivity(id))\n    }\n  }, [dispatch, id])\n\n  if (!app) {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"app-page\" data-testid=\"app-page\">\n        <div className=\"app-page__loading\" data-testid=\"app-page-loading\">\n          Loading app...\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"app-page\" data-testid=\"app-page\">\n      <button\n        className=\"app-page__back\"\n

<AppActions app={app} />\n      <ActivityLog\n        entries={activityEntries}\n        loading={activityLoading}\n        error={activityError}\n        appStatus={app.status}\n        onRefresh={handleRefresh}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default AppPage\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Polls for updates every 5 seconds when status is \"building\"\n- Loads app details and activity log\n- Shows header with app metadata\n- Displays action buttons (open live app, download source)\n- Activity log with live indicator\n\n### 3.3 **RequestPage** (`src/pages/RequestPage.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from '../store/hooks'\nimport { resetRequest } from '../store/requestSlice'\nimport WizardStepper from '../components/WizardStepper'\nimport DescribeAppForm from '../components/DescribeAppForm'\nimport AssessmentScreen from '../components/AssessmentScreen'\nimport RejectionResult from '../components/RejectionResult'\nimport AcceptanceResult from '../components/AcceptanceResult'\nimport './RequestPage.css'\n\nfunction RequestPage() {\n  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()\n  const { step, assessmentResult } = useAppSelector((state) => state.request)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    return () => {\n      dispatch(resetRequest())\n    }\n  }, [dispatch])\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"request-page\" data-testid=\"request-page\">\n      <WizardStepper currentStep={step} />\n\n      <div className=\"request-page__content\">\n        {step === 'describe' && (\n          <div className=\"request-page__form-wrapper\">\n            <DescribeAppForm />\n          </div>\n        )}\n\n        {step === 'assessment' && <AssessmentScreen />}\n\n        {step === 'confirmation' && assessmentResult === 'rejected' && <RejectionResult />}\n\n        {step === 'confirmation' && assessmentResult === 'accepted' && <AcceptanceResult />}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default RequestPage\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- 3-step wizard: describe → assessment → confirmation\n- Shows different components based on step\n- Resets state on unmount\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Redux Store Architecture**\n\n### 4.1 **Store Configuration** (`src/store/store.ts`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\nimport appsReducer from './appsSlice'\nimport requestReducer from './requestSlice'\nimport activityReducer from './activitySlice'\n\nexport const store =

Now let me create a comprehensive summary document of all the information I've gathered:\n\n## LoopBuilder Frontend - Complete Architecture Overview\n\nI've explored the LoopBuilder frontend extensively. Here's the complete analysis:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Main App Entry Point** (`src/main.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport { store } from './store/store'\nimport App from './App'\nimport './index.css'\n\nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <Provider store={store}>\n      <BrowserRouter>\n        <App />\n      </BrowserRouter>\n    </Provider>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n)\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Redux store is wrapped via Provider\n- React Router BrowserRouter enables routing\n- StrictMode for development warnings\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Main App Router** (`src/App.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport MainPage from './pages/MainPage'\nimport AppPage from './pages/AppPage'\nimport RequestPage from './pages/RequestPage'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Routes>\n      <Route path=\"/\" element={<MainPage />} />\n      <Route path=\"/apps/:id\" element={<AppPage />} />\n      <Route path=\"/request\" element={<RequestPage />} />\n    </Routes>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\n**Routes:**\n- `/` → MainPage (dashboard with app list)\n- `/apps/:id` → AppPage (app details, activity log)\n- `/request` → RequestPage (wizard for requesting new apps)\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Page Components**\n\n### 3.1 **MainPage** (`src/pages/MainPage.tsx`)\n\n```typescript\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from '../store/hooks'\nimport { fetchApps } from '../store/appsSlice'\nimport StatusFilter from '../components/StatusFilter'\nimport RequestAppCTA from '../components/RequestAppCTA'\nimport AppCardGrid from '../components/AppCardGrid'\nimport './MainPage.css'\n\nfunction MainPage() {\n  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()\n  const loading = useAppSelector((state) => state.apps.loading)\n  const error = useAppSelector((state) => state.apps.error)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    dispatch(fetchApps())\n  }, [dispatch])\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"main-page\" data-testid=\"main-page\">\n      <StatusFilter />\n      <RequestAppCTA />\n      {loading ? (\n        <div data-testid=\"main-page-loading\" style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '48px 0', color: 'var(--color-text-muted)' }}>\n          Loading apps...\n        </div>\n      ) : error ? (\n        <div data-testid=\"main-page-error\" style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '48px 0', color: 'var(--color-rejected)' }}>\n          {error}\n        </div>\n      ) : (\n

The user wants me to add tasks to the task queue using the `add-task.ts` script. Let me break down what they want:\n\n1. Change deployed app to loop-builder.netlify.app\n2. Update app-building package to the latest version (has webhook endpoint now)\n3. Setup AppBuilderEvent backend function to receive webhook calls and update database\n4. Setup SpawnContainer backend function webhook to start new app-building containers\n5. Add a status page with link on front page showing containers, events feed\n6. Use WEBHOOK_SECRET env var for webhook authentication\n7. Allow setting default prompt via SetDefaultPrompt webhook, shown on status page\n\n\n8. I need to map these into proper tasks using the skill system, thinking through what each one requires—deployment config changes, backend function setup, database schema updates, and frontend additions.\n\nLooking at the app-building package update, the user is saying the root app-building project now supports webhooks when starting containers, so I need to figure out how LoopBuilder should integrate with that webhook functionality rather than just updating a dependency version. I need to map out the implementation work: updating the database schema with new tables for containers and webhook events, writing backend functions to handle app builder events and container spawning, creating a frontend status page, and adjusting the deployment configuration. Looking at the available skills, schema and backend function work fits under the build category, deployment changes need their own task, and I should structure these as clear subtasks rather than doing the work myself since the user asked me to add tasks to the queue. Looking at the available skills, I should use the deployment skill for the URL change and the writeApp skill for both the schema updates and backend functions, as well as the frontend status page work.","signature":"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

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide.
