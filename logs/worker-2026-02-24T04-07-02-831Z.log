See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `strategy`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `tasks.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same strategy. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_017FWP6owxXmCJvpMmWWXGdh","session_id":"449586a0-aeb5-4844-9aea-191be50980d7","uuid":"7bbbd94e-9800-4740-ae3f-f0f3c06455d6"}

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_017FWP6owxXmCJvpMmWWXGdh","session_id":"449586a0-aeb5-4844-9aea-191be50980d7","uuid":"4584ad6d-d4d7-498b-938b-7f43da47d53d"}

You will build and/or maintain one or more\n     4→web apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n     5→\n     6→Key directories:\n     7→\n     8→* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n     9→* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n    10→* `strategies/tasks`: Strategies for performing tasks. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    12→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    13→  the work currently being done.\n    14→\n    15→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    16→external services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n    17→\n    18→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    19→\n    20→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n    21→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    22→2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n    23→3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    24→   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    25→\n    26→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    27→matching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    28→\n    29→## Worker Execution\n    30→\n    31→The worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks.json` sequentially. For each task,\n    32→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    33→\n    34→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    36→\n    37→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    38→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    39→\n    40→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    41→\n    42→## Task System\n    43→\n    44→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks.json`. The file contains an object\n    45→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `strategy`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    46→and a `timestamp`:\n    47→\n    48→```json\n    49→{\n    50→  \"tasks\": [\n    51→    {\n    52→      \"strategy\": \"strategies/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    53→      \"subtasks\": [\n    54→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    55→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    57→      ],\n    58→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    59→    }\n    60→  ]\n    61→}\n    62→```\n    63→\n    64→The agent NEVER reads or writes `tasks.json` directly. Instead, use:\n    65→\n    66→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\"`**:\n    67→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    68→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    69→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    70→\n    71→All subtasks in a task share the same strategy. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    72→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\n    73→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    74→\n    75→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    76→\n    77→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    78→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    79→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    80→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    81→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    82→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    83→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    84→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    85→\n    86→## Tech Stack\n    87→\n    88→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    89→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    90→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    91→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    92→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    93→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    94→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    95→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    96→\n    97→## Database\n    98→\n    99→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   100→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   101→frontend components.\n   102→\n   103→## Quality Gates\n   104→\n   105→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   106→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   107→\n   108→## Commits\n   109→\n   110→The worker commits automatically after each iteration.

The existing test structure in tests.md\n2. The AppSpec for AccountDetailPage\n3. The mockup image showing the AccountDetailPage\n\nFrom the mockup, I can see:\n- **AccountHeader**: Shows \"Account: Finished Goods Warehouse 2\", \"Type: Inventory Account\", \"Status: Active\" (with green badge), \"Edit Account\" button (with pencil icon, outline style), \"New Transaction\" button (with plus icon, filled/primary style)\n- **TrackedMaterialsTable**: \"Tracked Materials\" heading, table with columns:\n  - Material Name\n  - Category\n  - Unit of Measure\n  - Total Quantity (with sum icon Σ showing it's a sum across batches, displays as \"1,250.0 Sheets (Σ Batches)\")\n  - Number of Batches (e.g., \"12 Batches\")\n  - Actions (with \"View Material in this Account\" link and external link icon ↗)\n\nThe existing section in tests.md (lines 25-29) has a placeholder for AccountDetailPage tests that I need to fill in with test cases covering these components and their functionality.\n\nFor AccountHeader, I'm planning tests around displaying the account name and type, showing the status badge, and verifying that the Edit Account button and New Transaction button work correctly with proper navigation. For TrackedMaterialsTable, I need to verify all the columns render properly and that the action links function as expected. me look more carefully at the mockup:\n\nFrom the mockup:\n- The header shows \"Account: Finished Goods Warehouse 2\" as the main heading\n- Below: \"Type: Inventory Account | Status: Active\" (Active is in green badge/text)\n- Top-right buttons: \"Edit Account\" (pencil icon, outline style) and \"New Transaction\" (plus icon, filled/primary blue style)\n- Section heading: \"Tracked Materials\"\n- Table with columns for Material Name, Category, Unit of Measure, Total Quantity, Number of Batches, and Actions\n- Five materials listed: Steel Sheets (3mm) with 1,250 sheets across 12 batches, Aluminum Extrusion A with 4,500 meters across 8 batches, Polymer Granules (Blue) with 750.5 kg across 15 batches, Copper Wiring (Rolls) with 2,100 meters across 5 batches, and Circuit Boards (Model X) with 350 units across 20 batches, each with a link to view the material in this account\n- I don't see breadcrumbs on this page\n\n, but given the design consistency strategy that prioritizes consistent navigation across detail pages, I should add breadcrumb tests since MaterialDetailPage has them. The spec also mentions the header should show account name, type, and status with action buttons, and below that a table of all materials tracked in this account with the specified columns.\n\nNow I'm systematically writing tests for the AccountHeader component, covering the breadcrumb navigation (Home > Accounts > Account Name with proper link destinations), the account details display (name with prefix, type, and status badge), and the action buttons (Edit Account and New Transaction) including their interactions like opening forms and persisting or discarding changes.\n\nFor the

Basic Info is filled. Quantity transfers total 500 kg debit and 500 kg credit (balanced transfers). Batch allocations total 200 Units for one material — but these batch amounts are not balanced against any corresponding transfer.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Post\" button.\n- **Expected:** A validation error is displayed indicating that the total debits must equal total credits across all quantity transfers and batch allocations. The transaction is not saved until the double-entry equation balances.\n\n#### Test: Successful Post with balanced debits and credits\n- **Components:** BatchAllocationList, QuantityTransfersList, BasicInfoForm\n- **Initial state:** User is on `/transactions/new`. Basic Info is filled (Date: 2024-05-23, Reference ID: TRX-20240523-001, Description: \"Q2 Inventory Adjustment\", Type: Transfer). Quantity transfers are added that balance correctly. Batch allocations are added with matching amounts. Total debits equal total credits.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Post\" button.\n- **Expected:** The transaction is created and persisted. User is redirected to the TransactionDetailPage for the new transaction. The detail page shows all entered data: Basic Info fields, Quantity Transfers with source/destination accounts and amounts, and Batches Created with material and quantity. The new batches are created in the system and appear on their respective material detail pages. The new transaction appears in the TransactionsPage list and in the Recent Transactions on the Dashboard.\n\n#### Test: Newly created batches record lineage from source batches\n- **Components:** BatchAllocationList, QuantityTransfersList\n- **Initial state:** User is on `/transactions/new`. A quantity transfer references Source Batch ID \"BATCH-RM-A-001\". A new batch is created in the Batch Allocation section.\n- **Action:** User posts the transaction successfully.\n- **Expected:** The newly created batch's BatchDetailPage shows lineage information linking back to the source batch \"BATCH-RM-A-001\" and the originating transaction. The source batch's usage history is updated to include this transaction.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":26,"oldLines":8,"newStart":26,"newLines":124,"lines":[" "," Components: AccountHeader, TrackedMaterialsTable"," ","-<!-- Tests will be added by PlanPageAccountDetail -->","+### AccountHeader"," ","+#### Test: Breadcrumb navigation displays Home > Accounts > Account Name","+- **Components:** AccountHeader","+- **Initial state:** User navigates to `/accounts/A-1024-INV`.
