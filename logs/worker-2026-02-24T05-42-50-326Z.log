Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

[2026-02-24T05:41:18.024Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01HLeeaDMEufftzHeWzqT5is","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The TasksListPage section already exists and has comprehensive test entries for all three components: TasksHeader, TasksFilter, and TasksList. It looks like this work has already been done by a previous iteration. Let me carefully compare the existing content against the mockup to verify completeness.\n\nLooking at the mockup:\n1. **Navigation**: The mockup shows a horizontal top navigation (TaskFlow logo, Dashboard, Projects, Tasks (active), Team, user avatar dropdown). However, the existing CRM app uses a sidebar navigation pattern (as described in ClientsListPage). Per the strategy directive: \"Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. \n\nPrioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\" So the sidebar navigation pattern from other pages should be used consistently. The existing tests.md already tests sidebar navigation on other pages, so the TasksListPage section doesn't need to duplicate those tests since the sidebar is a shared component.\n\n2. **TasksHeader**: \"Upcoming Tasks\" title + \"New Task\" blue button - ✅ Already covered\n\n3. **TasksFilter**: Filter type dropdown with filter icon + \"Filter...\" text input - ✅ Already covered\n\n4. **TasksList**: Task cards with priority badges, task name, due date, assignee, action menu - ✅ Already covered\n\nNow I'm going through the mockup systematically to confirm all elements are tested: the page title, the new task button, the filter controls with dropdown and text input, and the task card components including priority badges with their color coding, bold task names, relative and absolute date formatting, and assignee information.\n\nThe action menu with its options for viewing details, editing, marking complete, and deleting is covered, along with the empty state and navigation behavior. The tasks are properly ordered by due date.\n\nLooking at the remaining jobs, the component decisions and test documentation for both the page and header are already in place, so those are complete.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the strategy requirements more carefully—every interactive element needs testing, all clickable targets must be specified, and state changes need to propagate across the UI. I'm noticing the navigation styling might not be fully accounted for in the tests, and I should verify that all the requirements are actually met before considering this done.\n\nLooking at the task creation flow, the test covers the form fields comprehensively, but I'm realizing there's a gap: when a task is created, it should also generate a timeline entry since the app spec shows the timeline consolidates all client-related events. The same applies to task completion and deletion—these state changes should trigger timeline updates, but the tests don't seem to verify that side effect. I'm realizing the tests need to cover timeline entries for every task mutation—creating, completing, deleting, and editing should all generate history entries on the client detail page. The current tests only verify tasks appear in the Tasks section but don't check for these timeline side effects. I should also verify whether the TasksListPage needs its own navigation test or if that's already covered elsewhere, since the mockup shows a top nav rather than sidebar. Looking at the TasksListPage components, there's no sidebar listed since it's a shared component tested elsewhere. The main gap I'm noticing is that timeline entries aren't being tracked—the strategy requires history entries for every mutation, so I should add tests verifying that creating, completing, editing, and deleting tasks all generate corresponding timeline entries. Looking at the existing content, I can see the test entries are already there, so I need to review them against the mockup and strategy to identify what's missing. The key gap I'm spotting is that the timeline entries for task mutations aren't documented—the strategy requires that every mutation tracked by the timeline needs a corresponding history entry, so I should add those to the test plan. I need to verify that when a task's client or deal association changes, it moves to the correct location. The edit dialog test looks solid with pre-populated fields, but I should consider whether we're testing enough variations—like changing the assignee or due date separately. Looking at the git history, it seems TasksListPage testing was already completed in earlier commits, so I'm probably iterating on existing tests rather than starting fresh. The main gaps I'm seeing are around timeline entry creation for task actions and ensuring association changes propagate correctly. ough. For **TasksFilter**, I'm seeing 10 tests that cover the dropdown display, category options, text filtering, filtering by various fields like priority and assignee, empty states, and filter reset behavior—that's actually 11 tests total. For **TasksList**, there are 12 tests documented so far covering card display, priority badge styling, task name formatting, and due date handling in both relative and absolute formats.\n\nContinuing through the TasksList tests, I see assignee display, ordering by due date, action menu options, navigation to details, edit and delete dialogs with confirmations, and empty states—bringing the total to 15 tests. Looking at what might be missing, I notice there aren't tests for timeline entries that track task mutations like creates, completes, deletes, and edits. The edit test also seems like it could be more comprehensive, testing changes to assignee and due date rather than just priority. I should check whether timeline entries are actually tested elsewhere, maybe in the client detail

But the TasksListPage tests don't verify timeline entries when tasks are created, completed, edited, or deleted from the Tasks List Page. This is a gap.\n\nLet me look at the specific tests that need timeline additions:\n\n1. **New Task can be created successfully** (line 1988) - Should add: \"And a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline recording the task creation\"\n2. **Action menu \"Mark as Complete\"** (line 2144) - Should add: \"And a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline recording the task completion\"\n\n\n3. **Action menu \"Delete\"** (line 2152) - Should add: \"And a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline recording the task deletion\"\n4. **Action menu \"Edit\"** (line 2130) - Looking at what events are actually tracked in the timeline (task created, note added, deal stage changed, email sent, contact added, status changed, task completed, deal created, attachment uploaded, attachment deleted, source info updated, contact removed), task editing isn't one of them, so I won't add a timeline assertion for that.\n\nNow I need to verify whether the \"New Task with optional deal association\" test should check for a timeline entry, and I should also add missing timeline verifications where they're needed. Let me also review the test strategy against what's actually being tested—the button styling and control appearance are mostly covered, though I should double-check the filter controls. I need to verify whether the Edit test actually checks that changes propagate to the client's Tasks section, since it only confirms persistence to the database. Looking at the job descriptions more carefully, I realize these are asking me to plan and add test coverage, so I should enhance the existing tests to be more thorough rather than just verify they exist.\n\nI'm going to add specific timeline entry verifications to several test cases. For the \"New Task can be created successfully\" test, I'll add a check that a timeline entry gets created on the client's timeline when a task is added. The same applies to the \"New Task with optional deal association\" test—I need to ensure the timeline captures the task creation event. I'm also planning to review the Action menu tests to see if there are similar gaps. removing the task from the deal's Linked Tasks section, and I need to add that a timeline entry gets created on the client's timeline to record the deletion event.","signature":"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

action)\n- **Then** all tasks are shown again\n\n#### Test: Changing filter type resets the text filter\n- **Given** the user has selected \"Priority\" from the filter type dropdown and typed \"High\" into the text filter\n- **When** the user changes the filter type dropdown to \"Assignee\"\n- **Then** the text filter input is cleared\n- **And** all tasks are shown until the user enters a new filter value\n\n### TasksList\n\n#### Test: Task cards display all required elements\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page is loaded with tasks\n- **Then** each task card displays: a color-coded priority badge, the task name in bold text, a due date, an assignee avatar with abbreviated name and role, and a \"...\" action menu button\n\n#### Test: Priority badges are color-coded correctly\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page shows tasks with different priorities\n- **Then** \"High\" priority tasks show a red/orange badge labeled \"High\"\n- **And** \"Medium\" priority tasks show a yellow badge labeled \"Medium\"\n- **And** \"Low\" priority tasks show a green badge labeled \"Low\"\n- **And** \"Normal\" priority tasks show a blue/teal badge labeled \"Normal\"\n\n#### Test: Task name is displayed in bold\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page shows a task named \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\"\n- **Then** the task name \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\" is displayed in bold text within the task card\n\n#### Test: Due date displays relative dates for upcoming tasks\n- **Given** a task is due today at 5:00 PM\n- **Then** the due date displays \"Due: Today, 5:00 PM\"\n- **Given** a task is due tomorrow at 10:00 AM\n- **Then** the due date displays \"Due: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM\"\n\n#### Test: Due date displays absolute dates for future tasks\n- **Given** a task is due on Oct 25, 2024\n- **Then** the due date displays \"Due: Oct 25, 2024\"\n\n#### Test: Assignee displays avatar, abbreviated name, and role\n- **Given** a task is assigned to Sarah Jenkins who is a PM\n- **Then** the task card shows an avatar image, \"Sarah J.\" as the abbreviated name, and \"(PM)\" as the role in parentheses\n- **Given** a task is assigned to David Lee who is in Sales\n- **Then** the task card shows an avatar image, \"David L.\" as the abbreviated name, and \"(Sales)\" as the role\n\n#### Test: Tasks are ordered by due date with soonest first\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page is loaded with multiple tasks with different due dates\n- **Then** tasks are displayed in chronological order with the soonest due date at the top (e.g., \"Due: Today\" before \"Due: Tomorrow\" before \"Due: Oct 25, 2024\")\n\n#### Test: Action menu opens with options\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page shows task cards\n- **When** the user clicks the \"...\" action menu on a task card (e.g., \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\")\n- **Then** a dropdown menu appears with options such as \"View Details\", \"Edit\", \"Mark as Complete\", \"Delete\"\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"View Details\" navigates to associated client detail page\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\" which is associated with client \"Acme Corp\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"View Details\"\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for \"Acme Corp\"\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Edit\" opens task edit dialog\n- **Given** the action menu is open for a task\n- **When** the user clicks \"Edit\"\n- **Then** an edit dialog opens pre-populated with the task's current data (name, due date, priority, assignee, client, deal)\n- **When** the user changes the priority from \"High\" to \"Medium\" and saves\n- **Then** the task card updates to show a yellow \"Medium\" priority badge instead of the red \"High\" badge\n- **And** the change is persisted to the database\n- **And** the updated priority is also reflected in the associated client's Tasks section on the Client Detail Page\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Edit\" dialog can be cancelled\n- **Given** the edit dialog is open for a task with modifications made\n- **When** the user clicks Cancel or closes the dialog\n- **Then** the dialog closes without saving changes\n- **And** the task card retains its original values\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Mark as Complete\" completes the task\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"Mark as Complete\"\n- **Then** the task is marked as completed\n- **And** the task is removed from the \"Upcoming Tasks\" list (or displayed with a completed visual style such as strikethrough)\n- **And** the task's completed status is reflected on the associated client's Tasks section on the Client Detail Page\n- **And** if the task is linked to a deal, the task's completed status is also reflected in the deal's Linked Tasks section\n- **And** a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline recording the task completion (e.g., \"Task Completed: 'Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan'\")\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Delete\" removes task with confirmation\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Prepare Weekly Status Report\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"Delete\"\n- **Then** a confirmation dialog appears (e.g., \"Are you sure you want to delete this task?\")\n- **When** the user confirms deletion\n- **Then** the task is removed from the tasks list\n- **And** the task is also removed from the associated client's Tasks section\n- **And** if linked to a deal, the task is removed from the deal's Linked Tasks section\n- **When** the user cancels deletion\n- **Then** the task remains in the list\n\n#### Test: Task list shows empty state when no tasks exist\n- **Given** there are no upcoming tasks in the system\n- **Then** the tasks list shows an empty state message (e.g., \"No upcoming tasks. Create a new task to get started.\")\n- **And** there may be a call-to-action button to create a task\n\n#### Test: Clicking a task card navigates to associated client detail page\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page shows a task card for \"Review Client Proposal Draft\" associated with client \"Globex Solutions\"\n- **When** the user clicks on the task card (on the task name area)\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for \"Globex Solutions\"\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":2161,"oldLines":6,"newStart":2161,"newLines":7,"lines":[" - **Then** the task is removed from the tasks list"," - **And** the task is also removed from the associated client's Tasks section"," - **And** if linked to a deal, the task is removed from the deal's Linked Tasks section","+- **And** a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline recording the task deletion"," - **When** the user cancels deletion"," - **Then** the task remains in the list"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

image, \"Sarah J.\" as the abbreviated name, and \"(PM)\" as the role in parentheses\n- **Given** a task is assigned to David Lee who is in Sales\n- **Then** the task card shows an avatar image, \"David L.\" as the abbreviated name, and \"(Sales)\" as the role\n\n#### Test: Tasks are ordered by due date with soonest first\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page is loaded with multiple tasks with different due dates\n- **Then** tasks are displayed in chronological order with the soonest due date at the top (e.g., \"Due: Today\" before \"Due: Tomorrow\" before \"Due: Oct 25, 2024\")\n\n#### Test: Action menu opens with options\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page shows task cards\n- **When** the user clicks the \"...\" action menu on a task card (e.g., \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\")\n- **Then** a dropdown menu appears with options such as \"View Details\", \"Edit\", \"Mark as Complete\", \"Delete\"\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"View Details\" navigates to associated client detail page\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\" which is associated with client \"Acme Corp\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"View Details\"\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for \"Acme Corp\"\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Edit\" opens task edit dialog\n- **Given** the action menu is open for a task\n- **When** the user clicks \"Edit\"\n- **Then** an edit dialog opens pre-populated with the task's current data (name, due date, priority, assignee, client, deal)\n- **When** the user changes the priority from \"High\" to \"Medium\" and saves\n- **Then** the task card updates to show a yellow \"Medium\" priority badge instead of the red \"High\" badge\n- **And** the change is persisted to the database\n- **And** the updated priority is also reflected in the associated client's Tasks section on the Client Detail Page\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Edit\" dialog can be cancelled\n- **Given** the edit dialog is open for a task with modifications made\n- **When** the user clicks Cancel or closes the dialog\n- **Then** the dialog closes without saving changes\n- **And** the task card retains its original values\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Mark as Complete\" completes the task\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"Mark as Complete\"\n- **Then** the task is marked as completed\n- **And** the task is removed from the \"Upcoming Tasks\" list (or displayed with a completed visual style such as strikethrough)\n- **And** the task's completed status is reflected on the associated client's Tasks section on the Client Detail Page\n- **And** if the task is linked to a deal, the task's completed status is also reflected in the deal's Linked Tasks section\n- **And** a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline recording the task completion (e.g., \"Task Completed: 'Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan'\")\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Delete\" removes task with confirmation\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Prepare Weekly Status Report\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"Delete\"\n- **Then** a confirmation dialog appears (e.g., \"Are you sure you want to delete this task?\")\n- **When** the user confirms deletion\n- **Then** the task is removed from the tasks list\n- **And** the task is also removed from the associated client's Tasks section\n- **And** if linked to a deal, the task is removed from the deal's Linked Tasks section\n- **And** a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline recording the task deletion\n- **When** the user cancels deletion\n- **Then** the task remains in the list\n\n#### Test: Task list shows empty state when no tasks exist\n- **Given** there are no upcoming tasks in the system\n- **Then** the tasks list shows an empty state message (e.g., \"No upcoming tasks. Create a new task to get started.\")\n- **And** there may be a call-to-action button to create a task\n\n#### Test: Clicking a task card navigates to associated client detail page\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page shows a task card for \"Review Client Proposal Draft\" associated with client \"Globex Solutions\"\n- **When** the user clicks on the task card (on the task name area)\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for \"Globex Solutions\"\n","numLines":93,"startLine":2085,"totalLines":2177}}}
