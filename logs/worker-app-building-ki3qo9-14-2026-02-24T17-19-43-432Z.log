You will build and/or maintain one or more\n     4→web apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n     5→\n     6→Key directories:\n     7→\n     8→* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n     9→* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n    10→* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n    24→3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    25→   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    26→\n    27→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    28→matching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    29→\n    30→## Worker Execution\n    31→\n    32→The worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    39→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    40→\n    41→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    42→\n    43→## Task System\n    44→\n    45→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→and a `timestamp`:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    60→    }\n    61→  ]\n    62→}\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    66→\n    67→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\"`**:\n    68→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    69→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    70→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    71→\n    72→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    73→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    74→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    75→\n    76→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    77→\n    78→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    79→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    80→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    81→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    82→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    83→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    84→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    85→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    86→\n    87→## Tech Stack\n    88→\n    89→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    90→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    91→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    92→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    93→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    94→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    95→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    96→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    97→\n    98→## Database\n    99→\n   100→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   101→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   102→frontend components.\n   103→\n   104→## Quality Gates\n   105→\n   106→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   107→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   108→\n   109→## Commits\n   110→\n   111→The worker commits automatically after each iteration.

Patterns\n\n### When Replay Was Most Effective\n\nReplay was used on 9 of 33 failures (27%) and achieved a **100% debugging success rate** when used. It was most effective for:\n\n- **Visual/layout bugs** (CSS z-index, overflow issues): PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot was the go-to sequence for identifying why clicks weren't reaching elements. Used in 3 action menu failures.\n- **Page-load and routing failures**: The full chain of PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot → ConsoleMessages → NetworkRequest → ReactComponents/ReactException was used to diagnose a blank-page issue caused by Netlify SPA redirects serving HTML for Vite module requests (MIME type errors).\n- **Data-flow tracing**: SearchSources → Logpoint → NetworkRequest was used to trace a seed data mismatch where tests expected fictional assignee names not present in the database.\n- **Timeout root-cause analysis**: PlaywrightSteps + NetworkRequest identified tight visibility timeouts and API response issues on detail pages.\n\n### When Replay Was NOT Used (24 instances)\n\n| Reason | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| Diagnosed from error output alone | 18 |\n| Pre-existing / unrelated failures | 4 |\n| Recording upload failed (ERR_ASSERTION) | 2 |\n| No recording available (infrastructure failure) | 1 |\n| Raw test log with no agent session | 1 |\n\nThe dominant reason (75%) was that the error output was sufficient to diagnose the issue. This typically happened for:\n- Strict mode violations where the error clearly named the ambiguous locator\n- Timeout errors in tests with obvious slow steps\n- Cross-test data contamination visible from parallel test output\n- Missing `data-testid` attributes clearly stated in error messages\n\n### Common Debugging Strategies That Worked\n\n1. **Error-output-first triage** (18/33 failures): Reading Playwright error messages directly. Works well for strict mode violations, missing selectors, and clear timeout messages.\n2. **PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot** (used in 6/9 Replay sessions): The most common Replay sequence. Identifies which step stalled, then visually confirms page state.\n3. **NetworkRequest for API verification** (used in 5/9 Replay sessions): Confirms whether backend returned correct data, isolating frontend vs backend issues.\n4. **ConsoleMessages for JS errors** (used in 3/9 Replay sessions): Catches module loading failures, MIME type errors, and runtime exceptions.\n5. **Logpoint for data-flow tracing** (used in 1/9 Replay sessions): Inspects runtime variable values to trace data mismatches through the component tree.\n\n### Common Debugging Strategies That Failed\n\n1. **Ignoring pre-existing failures**: 4 failures in `worker-…01-44-39.log` were pre-existing filter/sort issues. The agent correctly identified them as pre-existing but did not debug them, leaving them unresolved.\n2. **Missing `data-testid` without Replay**: 2 TasksHeader failures were diagnosed from error output but not successfully fixed in that session — the agent noted the missing attribute but the fix was incomplete.\n\n### Recurring Failure Categories\n\n| Category | Count | % of Total |\n|----------|-------|------------|\n| Timeout / slow operations | 8 | 24% |\n| Cross-test data contamination / parallel interference | 5 | 15% |\n| Strict mode violations (ambiguous locators) | 4 | 12% |\n| Pre-existing unrelated failures | 4 | 12% |\n| CSS z-index / overflow / layout | 3 | 9% |\n| Backend bugs (blanked fields, missing data) | 3 | 9% |\n| Missing data-testid attributes | 2 | 6% |\n| Test data mismatches (fictional vs seed data) | 1 | 3% |\n| Infrastructure (DB auth) | 1 | 3% |\n| SPA redirect / module loading | 1 | 3% |\n| Recording upload failure | 2 | 6% |\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\n### `skills/debugging/*.md`\n\n- **Add a \"PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot\" pattern** as the default first-line Replay debugging sequence. This was the most frequently used and successful combination (6/9 Replay uses).\n- **Add a \"NetworkRequest for data verification\" pattern** as a standard second step when the UI renders but shows wrong data or times out waiting for content.\n- **Add a \"Strict mode violation\" diagnostic pattern**: When Playwright reports \"strict mode violation\" with N matching elements, the fix is almost always to add more specific selectors (e.g., `nth`, `filter`, or `data-testid`). This can be diagnosed from error output alone — Replay is not needed.\n- **Add a \"Cross-test contamination\" pattern**: When tests fail intermittently with unexpected data states, check for parallel test interference. Solutions include unique test data per worker, serial mode for stateful tests, or per-test DB cleanup.\n- **Document the Logpoint + SearchSources strategy** for data-flow tracing when the UI renders but uses wrong values — trace from API response through state management to component props.\n\n### `skills/tasks/build/testing.md`\n\n- **Require unique test data per parallel worker**: 5 failures (15%) were caused by cross-test data contamination in `fullyParallel` mode. Tests that share mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) must either use unique identifiers or run serially.\n- **Set generous initial timeouts for first-test cold starts**: The Vite dev server cold start caused the first test in some suites to timeout. Consider adding a warm-up navigation or increasing the first test's timeout.\n- **Avoid hardcoded expected values**: Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g., \"expect 1 remaining task\") or specific names (e.g., \"David Lee\") break when test data changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data.\n- **Validate seed data in tests**: The fictional assignee name bug (`worker-…04-27-52.log`) would have been caught if tests verified their test data existed before asserting on it.\n- **Run `data-testid` validation before writing tests**: 2 failures were caused by missing `data-testid` attributes that tests expected. Consider a pre-test check that required test IDs exist in the component source.\n\n### `skills/review/reportTestFailures.md`\n\n- **Add a \"Failure Category\" field** to the per-log analysis template (e.g., timeout, strict-mode, data-contamination, CSS, infrastructure). This would simplify synthesis and enable automated categorization.\n- **Add a \"Pre-existing\" boolean field**: 4 failures were pre-existing and unrelated to the current work. Flagging these explicitly would allow them to be filtered from success rate calculations. Adjusted success rate excluding pre-existing: 85% → 89% (24/27).\n- **Add a \"Recording Available\" field**: Distinguishing \"Replay not used because not needed\" from \"Replay not used because recording was unavailable\" (2 upload failures + 1 infra failure) would give a more accurate picture of Replay adoption vs availability.\n- **Track re-run count**: The number of test re-runs needed to achieve all-pass (e.g., 18 runs in `worker-…01-10-03.log`) is a useful efficiency metric not currently captured.\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8387,"cache_read_input_tokens":31737,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8387,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4a98b6ea-940c-4209-b750-2c98c8b09e8a","uuid":"fded1c11-1277-4323-a4a8-16513cf3c5da"}

This can be diagnosed from error output alone — Replay is not needed.\n- **Add a \"Cross-test contamination\" pattern**: When tests fail intermittently with unexpected data states, check for parallel test interference. Solutions include unique test data per worker, serial mode for stateful tests, or per-test DB cleanup.\n- **Document the Logpoint + SearchSources strategy** for data-flow tracing when the UI renders but uses wrong values — trace from API response through state management to component props.\n\n### `skills/tasks/build/testing.md`\n\n- **Require unique test data per parallel worker**: 5 failures (15%) were caused by cross-test data contamination in `fullyParallel` mode. Tests that share mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) must either use unique identifiers or run serially.\n- **Set generous initial timeouts for first-test cold starts**: The Vite dev server cold start caused the first test in some suites to timeout. Consider adding a warm-up navigation or increasing the first test's timeout.\n- **Avoid hardcoded expected values**: Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g., \"expect 1 remaining task\") or specific names (e.g., \"David Lee\") break when test data changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data.\n- **Validate seed data in tests**: The fictional assignee name bug (`worker-…04-27-52.log`) would have been caught if tests verified their test data existed before asserting on it.\n- **Run `data-testid` validation before writing tests**: 2 failures were caused by missing `data-testid` attributes that tests expected. Consider a pre-test check that required test IDs exist in the component source.\n\n### `skills/review/reportTestFailures.md`\n\n- **Add a \"Failure Category\" field** to the per-log analysis template (e.g., timeout, strict-mode, data-contamination, CSS, infrastructure). This would simplify synthesis and enable automated categorization.\n- **Add a \"Pre-existing\" boolean field**: 4 failures were pre-existing and unrelated to the current work. Flagging these explicitly would allow them to be filtered from success rate calculations. Adjusted success rate excluding pre-existing: 85% → 89% (24/27).\n- **Add a \"Recording Available\" field**: Distinguishing \"Replay not used because not needed\" from \"Replay not used because recording was unavailable\" (2 upload failures + 1 infra failure) would give a more accurate picture of Replay adoption vs availability.\n- **Track re-run count**: The number of test re-runs needed to achieve all-pass (e.g., 18 runs in `worker-…01-10-03.log`) is a useful efficiency metric not currently captured.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
