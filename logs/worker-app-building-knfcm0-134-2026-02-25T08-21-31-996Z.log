You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_018kZ2CLR753XDfVEpKq9pCr","session_id":"1494741c-3433-4a47-a737-fdd8d106fcce","uuid":"63970e00-4139-4d9f-9d49-054ba2705420"}

A deal at \"Proposal Sent\" appears in the Proposal Sent column.\n\n**Deal cards display deal name**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card shows the deal's name (e.g., \"Project Alpha Expansion\").\n\n**Deal cards display client name**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card shows the associated client's name (e.g., \"Acme Corp.\").\n\n**Deal cards display value**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card shows the deal's monetary value (e.g., \"$250,000\").\n\n**Deal cards display owner**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card shows the deal owner's name.\n\n**Deal cards are draggable**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card is draggable — the user can click and hold the card to initiate a drag operation. The card visually indicates it is being dragged.\n\n**Dropping a deal card on a different stage column updates the deal stage**\nGiven the user drags a deal card from the \"Discovery\" column and drops it on the \"Qualification\" column, the deal's stage is updated to \"Qualification\" via the API, the card moves to the Qualification column, and the change is persisted to the database.\n\n**Drag-and-drop stage change creates a timeline entry on the deal's client**\nGiven the user drops a deal card to a new stage column, a \"Deal Stage Changed\" timeline entry is created on the associated client recording the old stage and new stage, attributed to the current user (or \"System\" if unauthenticated). Exactly one timeline entry is created.\n\n**Drag-and-drop stage change triggers follower notifications**\nGiven the user drops a deal card to a new stage on a deal whose associated client has followers, email notifications are sent to followers who have \"deal stage changed\" notifications enabled (excluding the actor).\n\n**Deal card click navigates to DealDetailPage**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, when the user clicks on the card (not during a drag), the app navigates to /deals/:dealId for that deal and the DealDetailPage is displayed.\n\n**Pipeline columns show deal count**\nGiven the pipeline view is active, each stage column header displays the count of deals in that column (e.g., \"Discovery (3)\").\n\n**Empty columns display empty state**\nGiven no deals exist at a particular stage, that stage column in the pipeline view displays an empty state (e.g., empty area or \"No deals\" message) but the column remains visible as a drop target.\n\n#### DealsPagination\n\n**Pagination shows current page and total pages**\nGiven the user is on /deals with Table View active and more deals than fit on one page, the pagination area displays text like \"Page 1 of 9\" indicating the current page and total pages.\n\n**Clicking next page navigates to the next page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 1 with multiple pages, when they click the next page control, the table updates to show page 2 data and the pagination text updates to \"Page 2 of 9\".\n\n**Clicking previous page navigates to the prior page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 2, when they click the previous page control, the table updates to show page 1 data.\n\n**Previous control is disabled on first page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 1, the previous page control is disabled or visually inactive, indicating there is no previous page.\n\n**Next control is disabled on last page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing the last page, the next page control is disabled or visually inactive, indicating there is no next page.\n\n**Pagination updates when filters reduce results**\nGiven the user is on /deals with pagination showing multiple pages, when they apply a filter that reduces the results to fit within one page, the pagination updates accordingly.\n\n#### CreateDealModal\n\n**Modal opens when Create New Deal is clicked**\nGiven the user is on /deals, when they click \"Create New Deal\", a modal dialog appears with a form title (e.g., \"Create New Deal\").\n\n**Modal contains deal name input field (required)**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Deal Name\" or \"Name\" text input field that is required.\n\n**Modal contains client dropdown populated from clients**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Client\" FilterSelect dropdown populated with existing clients from the API, with searchable functionality. It is not a free-form text field.\n\n**Modal contains value input field**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Value\" numeric input field for the deal's monetary value.\n\n**Modal contains stage selector**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Stage\" selector with deal pipeline stage options (e.g., Discovery, Qualification, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost).\n\n**Modal contains owner dropdown populated from users API**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains an \"Owner\" FilterSelect dropdown populated with team members from the users API, instead of a free-form text field.\n\n**Modal contains probability field**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Probability\" field for the deal's win probability (e.g., percentage input).\n\n**Modal contains expected close date picker**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains an \"Expected Close Date\" date picker field.\n\n**Modal contains status selector**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Status\" selector with options such as On Track, Needs Attention, At Risk.\n\n**Submit creates a new deal**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open and the user fills in deal name \"New Service Package\", selects client \"Acme Corp.\", enters value \"$50,000\", stage \"Qualification\", selects an owner, and clicks submit, the deal is created in the database, the modal closes, and the new deal appears in the deals table.\n\n**Deal creation generates a timeline entry on the client**\nGiven the user creates a new deal via CreateDealModal associated with a client, a \"Deal Created\" timeline entry is added to the client's TimelineSection attributed to the current user (or \"System\" if unauthenticated). Exactly one timeline entry is created.\n\n**Deal creation triggers follower notifications on the client**\nGiven the user creates a new deal associated with a client that has followers, email notifications are sent to followers who have \"deal created\" notifications enabled (excluding the actor).\n\n**Deal creation updates summary cards**\nGiven the user creates a new deal via CreateDealModal, the DealsSummaryCards (Total Active Deals, Pipeline Value) update to reflect the new totals without requiring a page refresh.\n\n**Modal validates required fields**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, when the user clicks submit without filling in the required deal name field, a validation error message is displayed and the form is not submitted.\n\n**Modal cancel closes without saving**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open and the user has entered some data, when they click the cancel button or close icon, the modal closes and no new deal is created.\n\n#### ImportDialog\n\n**ImportDialog opens when Import button is clicked**\nGiven the user is on /deals, when they click the \"Import\" button, the ImportDialog modal opens.\n\n**ImportDialog displays CSV format specification table**\nGiven the ImportDialog is open for deals, it shows a table of expected CSV columns: Name (required), Client Name (required — must match an existing client), Value (optional — numeric), Stage (optional — valid stage name), Owner (optional — team member name), Probability (optional — numeric 0-100), Expected Close Date (optional — date format), Status (optional — On Track/Needs Attention/At Risk/Won/Lost).

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1494741c-3433-4a47-a737-fdd8d106fcce","uuid":"98c1c28e-c26e-416f-925a-1e0d4126249c","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients.

Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

Client seems receptive...\"\n   - Edit\n\nI can also see additional writeup entries including a \"Needs Analysis\" note from John Doe on Oct 15 documenting the client's requirements around scalability and security, plus buttons to add new entries and manage versions. The deal has linked tasks tracking proposal preparation and a completed follow-up meeting, along with attached files like the requirements document and meeting notes. There are also contact records showing the key decision maker and influencers involved in this opportunity.\n\nNow I'm working through the implementation plan—I need to verify the component structure against the mockup and then add test scaffolding for each section. The components listed in the existing documentation appear to align with what the mockup shows, so I'll proceed with adding comprehensive test entries for the DealHeader, pipeline, history, metrics, writeups, linked tasks, attachments, and contacts sections.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1489,"cache_read_input_tokens":57640,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1489,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1494741c-3433-4a47-a737-fdd8d106fcce","uuid":"08e971f5-e11a-4bdf-a558-7846575a896b"}

No Dashboard, Reports, or other placeholder links are shown.\n\n**Clients link navigates to /clients**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Clients\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /clients and the ClientsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Contacts link navigates to /contacts**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Contacts\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /contacts and the ContactsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Deals link navigates to /deals**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Deals\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /deals and the DealsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Tasks link navigates to /tasks**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Tasks\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /tasks and the TasksListPage is displayed.\n\n**Team link navigates to /users**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Team\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /users and the UsersListPage is displayed.\n\n**Settings link navigates to /settings**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Settings\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /settings and the SettingsPage is displayed.\n\n**Active link is visually highlighted for current page**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the \"Clients\" sidebar link has a visually distinct active state (e.g., highlighted background or bold text), and all other links appear in their default inactive style. The same highlighting applies to whichever page is current — navigating to /deals highlights \"Deals\", navigating to /tasks highlights \"Tasks\", etc.\n\n**Active state updates on navigation**\nGiven the user is on /clients with the \"Clients\" link highlighted, when they click the \"Deals\" link, the highlight moves from \"Clients\" to \"Deals\" and the app navigates to /deals.\n\n**Sidebar persists across page navigation**\nWhen the user navigates between pages (e.g., from /clients to /deals to /tasks), the sidebar remains visible and does not re-mount or lose state.\n\n#### SidebarAuth\n\n**Sign In button displays when not authenticated**\nGiven the user is not logged in, the sidebar user area (upper left, below the app title) shows a \"Sign In\" button. No avatar, name, or sign-out control is visible.\n\n**Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form**\nGiven the user is not authenticated, when they click the \"Sign In\" button, an inline form appears within the sidebar containing: an email input field, a password input field, a \"Sign In\" submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch to \"Sign Up\" mode.\n\n**Sign In form submission with valid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters a valid email and password and clicks the \"Sign In\" submit button, the user is authenticated, the inline form disappears, and the sidebar user area shows the user's avatar (or initials), name, and a sign-out button.\n\n**Sign In form shows error for invalid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters an invalid email/password combination and clicks \"Sign In\", an error message is displayed within the form and the form remains visible for correction.\n\n**Sign In / Sign Up toggle switches form mode**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user clicks the \"Sign Up\" toggle, the form switches to Sign Up mode — the submit button text changes to \"Sign Up\" and the toggle text changes to allow switching back to \"Sign In\". Clicking the toggle again returns to Sign In mode.\n\n**Sign Up form submission creates account (test mode)**\nGiven the inline auth form is in Sign Up mode, when the user fills in an email and password and clicks \"Sign Up\", in test mode (IS_TEST=true) the account is auto-confirmed, the user is immediately logged in, and the sidebar shows avatar/name/sign-out. In production mode, a message indicates a confirmation email has been sent.\n\n**Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible, when the user clicks the \"Forgot password?\" link, the app navigates to /auth/forgot-password.\n\n**Avatar and name display when authenticated**\nGiven the user is logged in, the sidebar user area (upper left, below app title) displays the user's avatar (or initials fallback), their display name, and a sign-out control. The \"Sign In\" button is not visible.\n\n**Sign Out returns to unauthenticated state**\nGiven the user is logged in and their avatar/name is displayed in the sidebar, when they click the sign-out button, the user is logged out, the avatar/name/sign-out controls disappear, and the \"Sign In\" button reappears in the sidebar user area.\n\n**Auth state persists across page navigation**\nGiven the user is logged in, when they navigate between different pages (e.g., /clients to /deals to /settings), their avatar, name, and sign-out button remain visible in the sidebar user area throughout.\n\n---\n\n## ClientsListPage (/clients)\n\n### Components: ClientsListHeader, ClientsSearchAndFilters, ClientsTable, ClientsPagination, AddClientModal, ImportDialog\n\n#### ClientsListHeader\n\n**Page title displays \"Clients\"**\nGiven the user navigates to /clients, the page displays the heading \"Clients\" at the top left of the content area.\n\n**Import button is visible with icon and label**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the header area displays an \"Import\" button with a download/import icon and the text \"Import\".\n\n**Import button opens ImportDialog**\nGiven the user is on /clients, when they click the \"Import\" button, an ImportDialog modal opens for importing clients from CSV.\n\n**Export button is visible with icon and label**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the header area displays an \"Export\" button with an export icon and the text \"Export\".\n\n**Export button triggers CSV download**\nGiven the user is on /clients, when they click the \"Export\" button, a CSV file containing the current clients data is downloaded. The file includes columns matching the client data fields (Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired).\n\n**Add New Client button is visible with plus icon**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the header area displays a primary-styled (blue) \"+ Add New Client\" button with a plus icon and the text \"Add New Client\".\n\n**Add New Client button opens AddClientModal**\nGiven the user is on /clients, when they click the \"+ Add New Client\" button, the AddClientModal dialog opens with a form to create a new client.\n\n#### ClientsSearchAndFilters\n\n**Search bar is visible with placeholder text**\nGiven the user is on /clients, a search input is displayed with placeholder text \"Search clients by name, tag, or contact...\" and a search icon.\n\n**Search filters clients by name**\nGiven the user is on /clients with multiple clients displayed, when the user types \"Acme\" into the search bar, the table filters to show only clients whose name matches \"Acme\" (e.g., \"Acme Corp\").

The card visually indicates it is being dragged.\n\n**Dropping a deal card on a different stage column updates the deal stage**\nGiven the user drags a deal card from the \"Discovery\" column and drops it on the \"Qualification\" column, the deal's stage is updated to \"Qualification\" via the API, the card moves to the Qualification column, and the change is persisted to the database.\n\n**Drag-and-drop stage change creates a timeline entry on the deal's client**\nGiven the user drops a deal card to a new stage column, a \"Deal Stage Changed\" timeline entry is created on the associated client recording the old stage and new stage, attributed to the current user (or \"System\" if unauthenticated). Exactly one timeline entry is created.\n\n**Drag-and-drop stage change triggers follower notifications**\nGiven the user drops a deal card to a new stage on a deal whose associated client has followers, email notifications are sent to followers who have \"deal stage changed\" notifications enabled (excluding the actor).\n\n**Deal card click navigates to DealDetailPage**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, when the user clicks on the card (not during a drag), the app navigates to /deals/:dealId for that deal and the DealDetailPage is displayed.\n\n**Pipeline columns show deal count**\nGiven the pipeline view is active, each stage column header displays the count of deals in that column (e.g., \"Discovery (3)\").\n\n**Empty columns display empty state**\nGiven no deals exist at a particular stage, that stage column in the pipeline view displays an empty state (e.g., empty area or \"No deals\" message) but the column remains visible as a drop target.\n\n#### DealsPagination\n\n**Pagination shows current page and total pages**\nGiven the user is on /deals with Table View active and more deals than fit on one page, the pagination area displays text like \"Page 1 of 9\" indicating the current page and total pages.\n\n**Clicking next page navigates to the next page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 1 with multiple pages, when they click the next page control, the table updates to show page 2 data and the pagination text updates to \"Page 2 of 9\".\n\n**Clicking previous page navigates to the prior page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 2, when they click the previous page control, the table updates to show page 1 data.\n\n**Previous control is disabled on first page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 1, the previous page control is disabled or visually inactive, indicating there is no previous page.\n\n**Next control is disabled on last page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing the last page, the next page control is disabled or visually inactive, indicating there is no next page.\n\n**Pagination updates when filters reduce results**\nGiven the user is on /deals with pagination showing multiple pages, when they apply a filter that reduces the results to fit within one page, the pagination updates accordingly.\n\n#### CreateDealModal\n\n**Modal opens when Create New Deal is clicked**\nGiven the user is on /deals, when they click \"Create New Deal\", a modal dialog appears with a form title (e.g., \"Create New Deal\").\n\n**Modal contains deal name input field (required)**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Deal Name\" or \"Name\" text input field that is required.\n\n**Modal contains client dropdown populated from clients**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Client\" FilterSelect dropdown populated with existing clients from the API, with searchable functionality.
