Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test.

Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory.

Now let me systematically check each subtask.\n\n---\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecConfirmEmailPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations\n\nI need to check the ConfirmEmailPage test entries in `docs/tests.md` against all testSpec.md directives. Here are the entries to check:\n\n**Test entries in docs/tests.md for ConfirmEmailPage:**\n1. \"Valid token confirms email and auto-logs in\"\n2. \"Loading state is displayed during token verification\"\n3. \"Invalid token shows error message\"\n4. \"Expired token shows error message\"\n5. \"Already-used token shows error message\"\n6. \"Missing token shows error message\"\n7. \"Error state shows link to sign in\"\n\nNow checking each testSpec.md directive:\n\n**Directive: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup**\n- The ConfirmEmailPage doesn't appear to have a specific mockup (it's a functional page), but the spec entries cover: loading state, success state, error states (invalid, expired, used, missing), and sign-in link. This looks comprehensive.\n\n**Directive: Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements**\n- N/A — no complex UI elements.\n\n**Directive: For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result**\n- Entry 1 (\"Valid token...\") says \"redirects to /clients\" — exact target specified. OK.\n- Entry 7 (\"Error state shows link to sign in\") says \"When clicked, the app navigates to /clients (or the main page)\" — navigation target is specified. OK.\n\n**Directive: For any user action that mutates data, verify persistence and side effects**\n- Entry 1 confirms the email and logs in — this is a mutation. The entry describes the outcome (redirects to /clients with sidebar showing user's avatar, name, sign-out button). OK — the persistence verification is the logged-in state.\n\n**Directive: Button and control appearance matters**\n- Entry 7 specifies the link text \"Go to Sign In\" or \"Back to app\". OK.\n\n**Directive: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**\n- No modals on this page. N/A.\n\n**Directive: State-changing actions must test updates in other parts of the app**\n- Entry 1 confirms that after the email is confirmed, the sidebar shows the user's avatar, name, and sign-out button. This tests the cross-component effect of the confirm action. OK.\n\n**Directive: Images of different pages — consistent styling/navigation**\n- N/A — auth page has its own centered layout pattern.\n\nAll testSpec.md directives look satisfied for the ConfirmEmailPage entries.
