This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1).

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.

This is the nested-wait deadlock pattern. I need to replace this with atomic `toHaveCount` assertions.\n\n2. **DDP-HDR-02 test title mismatch**: The test title at line 102 says \"DDP-HDR-02: Editing client field updates the deal\" which matches the spec at line 852. Let me re-check... The spec says:\n   - `DDP-HDR-02: Editing client field updates the deal` — that matches line 102. Wait, let me re-read the job description more carefully.\n   \nActually, the job description says \"fix DDP-HDR-02 and DDP-ATT-04 test title mismatches to match spec\". Let me compare the test file against the spec more carefully to see where the actual discrepancies are.\n\nLooking at DDP-ATT-04, the spec says \"Download link downloads the file\" but the test title says \"Download link is present on attachments\" — those definitely don't match. For DDP-HDR-02, I initially thought they matched, but now I'm seeing the spec might actually say something different about editing the header and client name, not just updating the deal. Let me trace through the spec line numbers again to find the exact mismatch. I found the mismatch with DDP-ATT-04 — the test title says \"Download link is present on attachments\" but the spec expects \"Download link downloads the file\". For DDP-HDR-02, I need to check the spec more carefully since the titles appear to match at first glance. I'm comparing the spec titles against the actual test titles character by character. DDP-ATT-04 is clearly mismatched—the spec says \"Download link downloads the file\" but the test has \"Download link is present on attachments\". I need to update the test title to match the spec exactly. I'm identifying the three clear issues to fix: the deadlock in DDP-HIS-02 by replacing count() with atomic assertions, the title mismatch in DDP-ATT-04, and adding edit mode element assertions to DDP-WRT-04. For DDP-HDR-02, I need to check the writeTests.md file to understand if there's a specific format directive I'm missing, since the spec and test titles appear identical on the surface.","signature":"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

Let me identify the specific fixes needed:\n\n1. **DDP-HIS-02 toPass deadlock** (lines 358-367): The test uses `count()` inside a `.toPass()` block, which can deadlock. I need to replace it with atomic `toHaveCount` assertions.\n\nCurrent code:\n```ts\nawait expect(async () => {\n  const entriesAfter = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"deal-history-entry-\"]');\n  const countAfter = await entriesAfter.count();\n  expect(countAfter).toBeGreaterThan(countBefore);\n  // Verify the specific stage change entry exists\n  const matchingEntry = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"deal-history-entry-\"]', { hasText: expectedText });\n  const matchCount = await matchingEntry.count();\n  expect(matchCount).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1);\n}).toPass({ timeout: 10000 });\n```\n\nFix: Replace with atomic assertions...\n\nRewriting the fix... Still writing test assertions...\n\nActually, I realize there's no `toHaveCountGreaterThan` method in Playwright, so I need to split this into two separate atomic assertions—one checking that the specific history entry exists, and another verifying the total count increased by exactly one. Both will auto-retry, which keeps things safe.\n\nNow looking at the DDP-HDR-02 title mismatch issue more carefully—the test title and spec actually do match, so I'm wondering if I'm misunderstanding what needs to be fixed here. the earlier checking job made an error about DDP-HDR-02. Let me check if perhaps there are two DDP-HDR-02 entries (one in the spec and the job description is referring to a different section). No, there's only one DDP-HDR-02 in the spec.\n\nActually wait - I should look more carefully. The spec says \"Editing client field updates the deal\" and the test title matches that exactly. So maybe the checking job was overly cautious. But the job flagged it for a reason, so let me examine what the test actually does versus what the spec requires.\n\nThe directive is clear: test titles must match spec titles. They do for DDP-HDR-02, so that's not the issue. Let me focus on the actual mismatches I can identify - like DDP-ATT-04 where the spec says \"Download link downloads the file\" but the test says \"Download link is present on attachments\". For DDP-HIS-02, I need to replace the `count()` call inside toPass with an atomic assertion instead. HaveCount\n2. DDP-HDR-02: The job says \"title mismatch\" - maybe it's a subtle difference I'm not seeing. Let me accept the job description and check again...\n\nActually, you know what - I just re-read the spec and the titles match perfectly for DDP-HDR-02. The job description says to fix it, so let me look at this differently. Maybe the \"mismatch\" refers to the test CONTENT not matching the spec behavior, not the title itself? No, it explicitly says \"test title mismatches to match spec.\"\n\nLet me just keep DDP-HDR-02 title as-is since it already matches, and fix DDP-ATT-04 title and the other two issues.\n\n3. **DDP-ATT-04 title mismatch**: Spec says \"Download link downloads the file\", test says \"Download link is present on attachments\". Fix the test title.\n\n4. **DDP-WRT-04 add assertions**: The test clicks edit but doesn't verify that edit mode actually activates - it just waits 300ms. I need to add assertions checking that the editable input field and save/cancel buttons appear. Looking at DDP-WRT-05, I can see the test IDs I should target: `deal-writeup-edit-content-input` and `deal-writeup-edit-save-button`. After the edit click, I'll assert these elements are visible to confirm the edit mode is actually

It expected 2 entries but apparently the count didn't match.\n\nLet me check what `countBefore` was. From step 8, the count was queried at the beginning. Let me look at the actual count during the test. The test was expecting `countBefore + 1 = 2`, so `countBefore` was 1. The issue is that after clicking Change Stage, the new history entry wasn't appearing within 10 seconds.\n\nThis could be because:1. The stage change API call creates a history entry, but the UI doesn't refresh\n\n\n2. The DDP-HDR-04 test that ran earlier on the same worker also modified stages and created history entries, so the initial count was already higher than expected\n3. There's a race condition where both tests are operating on the same deal's history\n\nThe real problem is likely that DDP-HDR-04 ran first and left the deal in a state with more history entries than DDP-HIS-02 anticipated, throwing off the count assertion.\n\nBut wait, there's another angle here. The `toHaveCount(countBefore + 1)` check assumes exactly one new entry appears, but several things could go wrong: the initial count might have been captured before all history loaded, the stage change could trigger multiple API calls that each create entries, or the API response is just taking longer than the 10-second timeout. Let me trace through the recording to see what the actual counts were and check the console logs.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1685,"cache_read_input_tokens":97411,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1685,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f3f85851-cd5a-4139-a438-9d468872e6d8","uuid":"843e4b97-7477-4f1a-899c-7bc3f46655b0"}

When a stage change happens:\n1. `handleStageChange` is called\n2. It dispatches `updateDeal({ dealId, data: { stage: newStage } })`\n3. Then it calls `fetchDeal` and `loadDetailData` in parallel\n\nThe `updateDeal` thunk sends the update to the backend, which should create a history entry. Then `loadDetailData` fetches the updated history. \n\nThe question is: does the `updateDeal` redux thunk actually complete the backend call before returning? Let me look at the redux `updateDeal` action.\n\nBut wait - the test passed for DDP-HDR-04 which does the same thing. \n\nLet me trace through DDP-HIS-02 more carefully. The test captures the history count before changing the stage, then expects it to increment by one after the change. The issue might be that other tests running in the same worker are adding their own history entries, throwing off the count. But actually, the test reads the count right before the stage change, so that shouldn't matter unless there's a race condition where the history is being updated while we're checking it. the deal detail page, so it should get the current count including any entries from prior tests. And `countBefore + 1` should still be the correct expected count after adding one more.\n\nLet me reconsider this. The real problem might be that with `fullyParallel: true`, tests can run concurrently even within the same file. So DDP-HDR-04 and DDP-HIS-02 could be executing simultaneously on the same worker, both navigating to the same deal and modifying its stage. This means DDP-HIS-02 might read the initial count, then DDP-HDR-04 adds a history entry before DDP-HIS-02 actually clicks Change Stage, resulting in an extra entry that wasn't accounted for in the

That endpoint inserts into `deal_history` table\n4. Then `loadDetailData()` is called, which hits `GET /deal-detail?dealId=...` which queries `deal_history` table\n\n\n5. Looking at the test recording, I need to check what's happening after the stage change button is clicked - specifically whether there's a race condition between the parallel tests or if the issue is in how `handleStageChange` is awaiting both the deal fetch and detail data load.\n\nThe problem is becoming clearer: `handleChangeStage` in the header isn't async and doesn't await the `onStageChange` call, so when Playwright clicks the button, it returns immediately while the stage update and data reload happen asynchronously. The test then checks for the history entry with `toHaveCount(1)`, which has a 10-second retry timeout, but I need to verify whether the React component actually re-renders once `loadDetailData` completes and updates the history state. data.history)` which triggers a re-render, which should display the new history entries.\n\nWait, but there's an issue. Look at DealDetailHeader:\n```ts\nonStageChange: (newStage: DealStage) => void\n```\n\nThe type signature says `void`, not `Promise<void>`. So even though `handleStageChange` is async, the component fires and forgets the promise.\n\nNow the key question is: does the component properly re-render with the new history data? If `loadDetailData` is called and responds, yes it should. Let me check by looking at what `loadDetailData` returns in the second call (the one after the stage change).\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The recording has duration 15.8s. The test timeout is 30s. But the `toHaveCount` assertion times out at 10s. The real issue is whether the history updates within that 10-second window, so I need to trace through how DealHistorySection renders with the Replay tools.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3954,"cache_read_input_tokens":127966,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3954,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f3f85851-cd5a-4139-a438-9d468872e6d8","uuid":"12f798f7-36cb-419a-bcfc-4d1ab441ab82"}

[2026-02-20T12:09:44.613Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01S1rqnzv1SCskfJnCeDgj1Y","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I see the issue clearly! Look at the render data:\n\n- Renders 1-16 all show history with only 1 entry: `old_stage: \"lead\", new_stage: \"discovery\"` (the seed data)\n- Render 17-18 at time ~6539ms shows history with new entries: `old_stage: \"proposal\", new_stage: \"lead\"` and `old_stage: \"lead\", new_stage: \"proposal\"`\n\nBut the test expects to see \"Changed Stage from Discovery to Proposal\". Looking at the data:\n- Render 17: The first entry is `old_stage: \"proposal\", new_stage: \"lead\"` (some other test's stage change!)\n\n\n- The second entry is `old_stage: \"lead\", new_stage: \"proposal\"`\n\nWait, that can't be right. The test changes from discovery to proposal, but the history entries show `lead -> proposal` and `proposal -> lead`. This suggests the DDP-HDR-04 test running in parallel changed the deal's stage first, which means my test is seeing the side effects of another test's modifications instead of its own stage change.\n\nLet me trace through what's happening: DDP-HDR-04 reads the current stage and toggles it—if it's discovery, it changes to proposal, then restores it back. Since both tests run concurrently on the same deal, the history is getting interleaved with changes from both tests, which is why I'm seeing this confusing sequence of stage transitions. Looking at the actual history entries from render 17, I'm seeing the stages don't match what the test expects—there's no \"discovery to proposal\" transition at all, just \"proposal to lead\" followed by \"lead to proposal\" and then back to \"discovery\" from the seed data. The test is looking for \"Changed Stage from Discovery to Proposal\" with the proper capitalization from `formatStage`, but the history data shows a completely different sequence of changes.\n\nThis looks like a race condition between the two tests: DDP-HDR-04 changes discovery → proposal, then restores it back to discovery, while DDP-HIS-02 tries to make the same discovery → proposal change but the backend never records it because the deal's already been modified.\n\nLooking at the update handler, it checks the current stage in the database before creating a history entry. The issue is that DDP-HDR-04's restoration happens between DDP-HIS-02's requests, so when DDP-HIS-02 tries to change the stage, the backend sees it's already at the target stage or the timing causes the history entry to be skipped. The real problem is that `fullyParallel: true` runs tests on the same database simultaneously, causing race conditions when multiple tests modify the same deal. DDP-HIS-02 needs to be more resilient—either by creating its own deal or by reading the current stage and choosing a different target stage that won't conflict with other tests. Looking back at the initial count issue, the test expected to see a stage change entry, but by the time the data loaded, something had already changed the stage.\n\nThe simplest fix is to stop relying on exact text matches for stage changes since parallel tests might alter the deal, wait for the page to stabilize with `networkidle` after clicking Change Stage, and then assert on the history entry.\n\nBut looking more carefully at the timeline, I see the real issue: when DDP-HIS-02 changes the stage, DDP-HDR-04 has already changed it to \"proposal\" first, so the history entry never gets recorded for DDP-HIS-02's operation. The fix should make the test more resilient by navigating to a fresh deal state.\n\nActually, the simplest approach is to stop checking for an exact count increase and instead accept that parallel tests might add multiple history entries—I just need to verify the specific entry I'm looking for exists rather than validating the exact count.\n\nBut the real problem is that the DDP-HIS-02 test's stage change isn't being recorded at all because the backend sees the stage is already set to \"proposal\" from the earlier test. The race condition is the root cause. I could serialize these tests, create a fresh deal for each one, or ensure the page fully reloads the current state before checking what stage to transition to next. the real issue: multiple tests are using the same stage transition logic, so they're all competing for the same state changes. I need to make each test use a unique target stage so they don't interfere with each other—DDP-HIS-02 should transition to 'negotiation' instead of 'proposal', avoiding the collision with DDP-HDR-04 and

New pages: Login (/login) with email/password and Google OAuth, Register (/register) with name/email/password and Google OAuth, AuthCallback (/auth/callback) for OAuth redirects. All app routes are protected by a RequireAuth guard that redirects unauthenticated users to /login. The sidebar displays the authenticated user's name, avatar, and a sign-out button.

Removed Login and Register pages. Removed RequireAuth route guard — all pages are accessible without authentication. SSO (Google OAuth) now opens in a popup window instead of navigating the current window. The sidebar user area moved to the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.

Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n    28→\n    29→2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. The Settings page has two sections: (1) Import & Export — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV. (2) Webhooks — CRUD for webhook configurations that can send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint. Sidebar navigation now includes Clients, Deals, Tasks, and Settings.\n    30→\n    31→2/19/2026: Webhook modal now includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    32→\n    33→2/20/2026: Fixed testSpec directive violations on UsersListPage: added UserCards test section in docs/tests.md with ULP-CRD-01 (card content verification for avatar, name, email, active deals count, open tasks count), moved ULP-HDR-02 (card click navigation) under UserCards section, and updated ULP-HDR-01 Playwright test to verify card content (names, emails, deal/task counts).\n    34→\n    35→2/20/2026: FilterSelect dropdowns with many options now include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    36→\n    37→2/20/2026: Fixed testSpec directive violations: CDP-HDR-02 now includes name save persistence verification (edit name, save, confirm persisted after reload) per the directive requiring mutation persistence tests. CDP-QA-04 stage dropdown label corrected from 'Proposal' to 'Proposal Sent' to match the actual application UI labels used in AddDealModal and other components.\n    38→\n    39→2/20/2026: Added DDP-ATT-06 file upload test entry to docs/tests.md and corresponding Playwright test using setInputFiles for the DealDetailPage UploadAttachmentModal. The UploadAttachmentModal already used real file upload via UploadThing (/.netlify/functions/upload), but the existing DDP-ATT-03 test only exercised link URL mode. The new test verifies actual file upload mechanics end-to-end: file selection via setInputFiles, upload via UploadThing, and persistence in the attachments list.\n    40→\n    41→2/18/2026: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) and User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId). Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. Added /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members. Sidebar now has \"Team\" nav item.

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\n2/14/2026: Sidebar navigation contains only Clients, Deals, and Tasks links. Dashboard, Reports, and Settings links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n2/14/2026: Filter dropdowns on the deals page use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system.\n\n2/16/2026: Deal detail page attachment upload modal now supports both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page now supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n2/16/2026: Task links on client detail page and deal detail page now navigate to /tasks/:taskId (the task detail page) instead of the deal detail page or being non-clickable.\n\n2/16/2026: Added Supabase authentication system. New pages: Login (/login) with email/password and Google OAuth, Register (/register) with name/email/password and Google OAuth, AuthCallback (/auth/callback) for OAuth redirects. All app routes are protected by a RequireAuth guard that redirects unauthenticated users to /login. The sidebar displays the authenticated user's name, avatar, and a sign-out button. All 10 Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware. Timeline events and deal history now attribute actions to the authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n\n2/17/2026: Authentication is now optional. Removed Login and Register pages. Removed RequireAuth route guard — all pages are accessible without authentication. SSO (Google OAuth) now opens in a popup window instead of navigating the current window. The sidebar user area moved to the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated.\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import dialog on the clients page now shows a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Includes a \"Download CSV template\" button that generates a sample CSV file. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import extended to support deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks in addition to clients. Deals page has Import button with CSV format (Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status) — client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with CSV format (Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee) — client lookup by name. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with CSV format (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) — creates individuals and optionally associates them with clients by name. Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n\n2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. The Settings page has two sections: (1) Import & Export — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV. (2) Webhooks — CRUD for webhook configurations that can send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint. Sidebar navigation now includes Clients, Deals, Tasks, and Settings.\n\n2/19/2026: Webhook modal now includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n2/20/2026: Fixed testSpec directive violations on UsersListPage: added UserCards test section in docs/tests.md with ULP-CRD-01 (card content verification for avatar, name, email, active deals count, open tasks count), moved ULP-HDR-02 (card click navigation) under UserCards section, and updated ULP-HDR-01 Playwright test to verify card content (names, emails, deal/task counts).\n\n2/20/2026: FilterSelect dropdowns with many options now include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n2/20/2026: Fixed testSpec directive violations: CDP-HDR-02 now includes name save persistence verification (edit name, save, confirm persisted after reload) per the directive requiring mutation persistence tests. CDP-QA-04 stage dropdown label corrected from 'Proposal' to 'Proposal Sent' to match the actual application UI labels used in AddDealModal and other components.\n\n2/20/2026: Added DDP-ATT-06 file upload test entry to docs/tests.md and corresponding Playwright test using setInputFiles for the DealDetailPage UploadAttachmentModal. The UploadAttachmentModal already used real file upload via UploadThing (/.netlify/functions/upload), but the existing DDP-ATT-03 test only exercised link URL mode. The new test verifies actual file upload mechanics end-to-end: file selection via setInputFiles, upload via UploadThing, and persistence in the attachments list.\n\n2/18/2026: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) and User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId). Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. Added /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members. Sidebar now has \"Team\" nav item. Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal now show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":38,"oldLines":4,"newStart":38,"newLines":6,"lines":[" "," 2/20/2026: Added DDP-ATT-06 file upload test entry to docs/tests.md and corresponding Playwright test using setInputFiles for the DealDetailPage UploadAttachmentModal.
