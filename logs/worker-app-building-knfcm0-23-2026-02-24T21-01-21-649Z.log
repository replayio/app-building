Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a7445cc1-4807-4749-b25d-edc074012aa8","uuid":"947f9b3b-d2e8-4ed5-8a6d-f93a977e0fac","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a7445cc1-4807-4749-b25d-edc074012aa8","uuid":"1c2ba0ae-3e4d-49d6-b30d-25b2a1b5fd16","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

According to the skill, I need to \"unpack\" the write app task into subtasks. Let me identify the pages:\n\n1. DashboardPage (/)\n2. AccountsPage (/accounts)\n3. AccountDetailPage (/accounts/:accountId)\n4. MaterialsPage (/materials)\n5. MaterialDetailPage (/materials/:materialId)\n6. BatchDetailPage (/batches/:batchId)\n7. TransactionsPage (/transactions)\n8. TransactionDetailPage (/transactions/:transactionId)\n9. NewTransactionPage (/transactions/new)\n\n\n10. SettingsPage (mentioned in nav but not fully specified)\n\nI notice there's no Batches listing page in the spec even though the nav references Batches. Now I'll create the subtasks following the skill's approach: first a setup task with SetupApp and DesignDatabase, then one task per page with all its components. Looking at the test spec, I can see what components belong to each page—for instance, DashboardPage needs NavigationHeader, DateRangeFilter, CategoryFilter, LowInventoryAlerts, MaterialsCategoriesOverview, and RecentTransactionsTable. I'm noticing that some components like NewTransactionButton appear across multiple pages, so I should treat them as belonging to the first page where they show up. Looking more closely at the shared layout structure, NavigationHeader and SidebarNavigation seem to map to existing AppLayout and Sidebar components, though I need to verify this against the actual test specifications to understand what's being tested. I need to organize the implementation into tasks: first setting up the app and database, then tackling each page with its components. Looking at the tests, NavigationHeader appears to be shared across pages, while components like LowInventoryAlerts, MaterialsCategoriesOverview, and RecentTransactionsTable are specific to the dashboard, and StockAccountsList belongs to the accounts page.\n\nFor the remaining pages—AccountDetail, Materials, MaterialDetail, BatchDetail, Transactions, and TransactionDetail—I'll group their respective components together, with each page getting its own write task to ensure the layout and routing are properly implemented. TransactionDetail\n\n**NewTransactionPage:**\n- BasicInfoForm\n- QuantityTransfersSection\n- BatchAllocationSection\n- WritePageNewTransaction\n\nI need to reconsider the structure here. The skill asks for one task per page with all its components as subtasks, so I should call add-task once for setup and then once for each page. Some components like NewTransactionButton will appear across multiple pages, but I can reuse them rather than rewriting. Looking at the test specs, these components are detailed enough to warrant their own files, so I'll organize the tasks accordingly: first a setup task for the app and database, then separate tasks for DashboardPage, AccountsPage, and the other pages, each containing their specific components as subtasks. I need to reconsider the structure here. The skill instructions are clear: one task per page, and every JSX element needs its own component file. So I should follow that pattern consistently rather than trying to combine things. Let me think about the ordering too—backend setup, then Redux, then smaller sections and modals, and finally the page component itself. For something like DashboardPage with seven components, that's a lot of subtasks, so I should look at what can reasonably be grouped together without violating the abstraction rule.\n\nLooking at the components I listed, NavigationHeader is shared across pages so it's definitely important. DateRangeFilter and CategoryFilter could both be reusable across different pages. The dashboard-specific ones like LowInventoryAlerts, MaterialsCategoriesOverview, and RecentTransactionsTable should each be their own task. NewTransactionButton is small but still needs its own file if it's rendered on the page.\n\nI think the right approach is to treat each component as its own subtask within the page task, keeping the number reasonable. Now I need to think about the backend work—the database schema needs to come first, then the API endpoints, and only then should I write the Redux slice and components. Let me map out the add-task commands with that dependency chain in mind. I'm adding the filter components and the main page itself to the dashboard task, so that's 7 subtasks total handled in one conversation. Let me reconsider the context limits though—I should check if there's guidance from previous builds on how many components fit in a single task before I commit to this approach. The skill text is pretty explicit about one task per page with all its components included, so I'll stick with that structure.\n\nFor the NavigationHeader, since it appears across all pages, I'll bundle it with the DashboardPage task where it's first introduced. I also notice the nav references Settings and Batches pages that don't have specs yet—I should add basic tasks for those. The batches seem to be accessed through materials rather than as a standalone feature, but I'll create a simple listing page anyway.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the task ordering. Since each page task handles its own backend, state management, and components, the sequence matters—the dashboard will depend on data from other entities. I'll start with setup, then work through the pages in a logical dependency order. I'm settling on a task order based on data dependencies. The foundational entities need to come first—accounts, then materials, then batches—followed by transactions which reference everything, and finally the dashboard that aggregates all the data. That gives me ten distinct tasks to work through in sequence. I need to balance the requirement that every component has its own file with practical task organization—I'll list the major components as subtasks while grouping smaller ones with their related larger component or the page itself. Now I'm mapping out the specific tasks: setup with app initialization and database design, then one task per page with subtasks for each substantial component plus the page itself. I'm mapping out the remaining pages and components needed—TransactionsPage with its table, TransactionDetailPage with header and related tables, NewTransactionPage with forms for batch allocation and quantity transfers, and continuing through the rest of the feature set.\n\nWait, I'm realizing NavigationHeader is used across all pages according to the tests, so writing it last would leave everything else without it. I should either prioritize it earlier or create a separate shared components task. Looking at the existing AppLayout and Sidebar, the NavigationHeader might already be partially implemented there, but I need to clarify what's actually needed versus what's already in place.\n\nThe mockups show two distinct navigation patterns: a top header bar on the DashboardPage with links to major sections, and a sidebar on the AccountsPage. Since these are shared across pages, I should probably include the NavigationHeader setup in the initial setup task rather than burying it in the DashboardPage task.\n\nLet me think about the task structure: SetupApp will handle Vite, routing, Redux, and the shared app layout including the NavigationHeader, then each page task focuses on page-specific components. But I'm noticing the nav mentions \"Batches\" as a link, yet there's no BatchesPage spec provided—I should check the test requirements to see if that's actually needed.
