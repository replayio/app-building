Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

etc.).\n\n**AppCardGrid: Filters cards based on StatusFilter selection**\nGiven there are apps in all three states (Building, Finished, Queued),\nwhen the user selects \"Building\" in the StatusFilter,\nthe AppCardGrid shows only apps with status \"Building\".\nWhen the user switches to \"Finished\", only finished apps are shown.\nWhen the user switches to \"Queued\", only queued apps are shown.\n\n**AppCardGrid: Empty state when no apps match filter**\nGiven there are no apps with status \"Queued\",\nwhen the user selects the \"Queued\" tab in the StatusFilter,\nthe AppCardGrid displays an empty state message or placeholder indicating no apps are available in this category.\n\n**AppCardGrid: Updates when new apps are added**\nGiven the user is on MainPage with the \"Queued\" filter selected,\nwhen a new app request is accepted and queued (e.g., by another user or after the current user submits a request and returns to MainPage),\nthe AppCardGrid includes the newly queued app as an AppCard on page refresh or next data fetch.\n\n**AppCardGrid: Responsive layout**\nGiven the user is on MainPage on a standard desktop viewport,\nthe AppCardGrid displays cards in a 2-column layout as shown in the mockup, with consistent spacing between cards.\n\n## AppPage (/apps/:id)\n\n<!-- Components: AppHeader, AppActions, ActivityLog, ActivityLogEntry -->\n\n### AppHeader\n\n**AppHeader: Displays app title**\nGiven the user navigates to AppPage (/apps/:id) for an app titled \"My Saas Platform (Customer Portal MVP)\",\nthe AppHeader displays the app title as a

Let me analyze it:\n\nThe bug is: \"Webhook docs are not user-friendly — they need a working copy button for curl commands with YOUR_SITE replaced by the actual site URL.\"\n\nTwo issues:\n1. No copy buttons on curl commands\n2. YOUR_SITE placeholder not replaced with actual site URL\n\nNow let me classify following the steps in the skill:\n\n1. **Is this a styling/UI problem?** - This is about UI usability — missing copy buttons and missing dynamic URL substitution. The copy button is a UI feature, and replacing YOUR_SITE with the actual URL is about how the component renders.\n\n\n2. Looking back at the old test entries, I can see the tests only mention that curl commands should be accurate and demonstrate how to call the endpoint — there's no mention of copy buttons or dynamically replacing YOUR_SITE with the actual origin URL.\n\n3. This tells me the YOUR_SITE replacement is a functional issue since the commands aren't actually usable as displayed, while the copy button is new functionality that wasn't part of the original requirements.\n\nLooking at the test spec more carefully, it mentions \"correct URL path\" and allows for placeholder values like the Bearer token, but it's ambiguous about whether the site URL itself should be a placeholder or the actual origin. So the YOUR_SITE problem is really about underspecified requirements rather than broken existing functionality. and the test spec also lacks any entries verifying that copy functionality exists for these commands. The YOUR_SITE replacement is the more critical issue since it affects the usability of existing functionality, while the copy button is a new feature request. So the problem stage should be testSpec.md for the placeholder substitution gap, though the copy button part doesn't have a problem stage since it's new functionality.\n\nNow I'm checking whether AppRevisions.md needs updating. The fix introduced copy buttons and dynamic URL replacement—both behavioral changes that should be documented. Let me review what was actually modified between the before and after versions.","signature":"ErItCkYICxgCKkAolVm4P0jNu+f/2IIkJaFHF8U/SqX7FxJNGjtycgmOFY/Z+YuoutihbiY1UUWgYi7jMLEgxPlH4IDNkGxllaV0Egy5M8+9PTbhRtnCRfoaDEG/TbZDqdhyYYyLaSIwePxkcEio2Y7f3C4BTTYj4bz8P6Kf/h+95BncYXZ1RuStmiQR3LdHiMlxxS1+7xVDKpksBdO8rQMA9A+jN8Mkszj7hdWnYMo2PR6Ay9fKQ4Gnp7BZWfo+r34nP7jPA7t+4FSnBXRmgcSULQLL7Bot4t/gzaPgNaL4TEAw5NOwLJExKlRJTtAo09CvKfIethFWtJy6qm8+Qq7MdkXq/mRHp5yl0k6YQJ2hBpdHDtfwBkio5+QlGhZvWaha02d/Mnqv5z9CbCyKfzLomqR0x1vOgw7m/B2n+X6+VU1RuwSVJuFmiiyYsyDLzCYQM+irXAtVx/NHV1/HDptuVmM+7e/bfsN2JFqeH1G8ceT5lymePWd2NbV4Ia+/A6hnRo/E57LkRAXOn8LcfmyCt2SSehCfpMb4eUNUuDK53Xr9ebyuxboTchlKqZ36PUixZIt3SuK5sWwXVkEfBk5RHdzfRURS3SqcH9nyfwGdWj6f6V7nMjAuw2iZfqqb2E9LFrMpTEiNrETr4ZklLNqiY8Hf+gbM/swfj0OmppaN7AbSRitDVjJqcYdsBrrp9dKvrr3grxbeAKcbasnTO2spRn3dA4jGoEPzAXfJU/ipdt6CSnQugIOK/W1UCw7E+ibBRsm+IlxpTriFqELxcimg/wIeN8Fcg/Hc9uWoQyYVd1bnOsYVHONY1uI0lnri0TW6MIE8PCJim52oPzzt7yMznvzeFMDPvdYCR+G3pnPK21VFrnPmQmL82Mba9n+NHPAOqdFOccBNzkC719Lzt3kTlOIWg5ERvsyCVrQb7qsiX8871Y0zAl8eaN0Qiy8ARskQ/b7Tx6is1H34pvVr+Kt5KG0wOCO5GMywJy2RUeTmLlk6zgaKzSPp6rYPOokuzN5FKhIPDgVLTZjYupU3utt4aD2mSGv38W7IfC89YmV017pBmj6TmiAaro0YiY9Dmw05jaC/k5djWIaEcFAFbIGM8K+ylEvL0LpKQj32phXpGV5H9eRxgf0ktxZWueNqflqhWsNcRXbzxqxpuFYE8kMPSGBCn72yzdLBPLwrMqlIt33I81pgkmCbAORIoksNRqqIHg4oHfrvtlsV4whGMeB+lyWQ/Xgj7i+18SLFx1ZGiCEV3Qx/RF8D7ldZKEkiylvBbbmYACnVLuAaYpYpmMq1aAtZBA0wZHe+faNidlsvpn/Ve1j9IdeWWa6Db275EakUSiwl1G/Vx7YXXNNQoSyKW44Jlz7md+l9aY38D3Cadi5XXcbsPNV02DxbG5sWHZeJvLc9qgYUa6k+d3Vlc3iSboz4VYHoVwQEeoOK9HxP18cIOR9KTPUY/9HJNirvw0QHFqsOUdD5lxwW/UZg7R4K+r3jLfhiyTEYSTcZACltKtIQ6jcvExiJF1uNXVh6BsIfygZjP6WL20CvGUzSopdE21FG68ADPf1KLEcGExwL8eMr+iMJpsFjunfOJwKfNIWLLIsHwtWjaZoxdClF6TFIIteMzpXLU7OhGU9vKy4ZeVKv3PSlbOZRv4ec18sNPYnJlTmLP2SHH/HHvDG/5s9n5pRAEpErjpGjFE5COhvIHkCsEGBnBZMJkYJ1byGS7xyQ+jl5UkqgRmtpLPJLk3IuZbmbkLMc784sjKRqIp3Q54hPyCXf9zRFW9nnSnPf2t5/vdbL6VEfUKZgMM6nGqPw13UHVKLUPuMKv6H7QgmSRB2ZC3aIBR+Gex7dKSvExw1Nee/6L+7nliOfWEWsrzbsnDmcQ5owd6hCXOrKdg6jK6TUVJwCS/bHw31RjeOXT4b1S4a1iwhHJLKs67D31QxVEOCCfl541J/16pJGLljm8iP/c/V2WbfI6vFgdn/+xK9KB7Gy4++I7izWJ/Q2NGEWEKD56A/qda43vTCBtZ69h/W2bsYXsPvwCzYpZEQRurAYx8+6X4e6NF6JoMK9tibeSPWt2C2DDIaiAqOOSsgHwLrVUFxDI2aFdEVAijp1Jp9HZ5QKwfj0RpGN6PPc0tP4EHf+kiXajCoYtd96I8iasRr6F/hPRh28qs4H6xX+6XajUhY75V4I5QS+/dYZYD1wDppQ5DxT/k2C2BzDImXWWrJlvJ/quEDrJbbyzDCozCnrLtb4Wx3eJH605ruvSGk3JdrFujeYY4Lojz5CqHOFmN2qNDiEoZUmLN3Lo3KiFWbsoTGH8k2B9Shv8bzzmlcov+sDNAFnTy1gCtP5s8sfMsMDzVMz5fP0h4YrjS52ltRkUjVa8GaqNvPQV1/s1XelWayHvzFL6ax93+IGHViq3SxPHzcd7a+C5gC76sTONqD5IMqVatSZPO0IHSgfcLbnfx2OM05e6Aok1sJSu9OU1Yl50gKYxPu2BDH4xqzHYTvgL7Hpe2p/eIXy34T6PKUBjqJKmLDTg5eCqZgBKZE3QkE+4yKS/TAA4YpfdceczU5zRZG6Y8vyPijopLBmxUWi/mE/RDv+hm3yArQIyrzJcJzmyTSMYG2V61y1fHkYn0bNpKLlLcmpw4TEb3BsBTREt7swjXZ4fOty2dJVqqB2ePxvnhGiwxFgagIl7lRLXFIDpSbf7tiATTagSPEne2W2NC4iMWerBxd6Z64r77l1mbgglu9wtkieeumrC3tlyEub4Ql3H9UMAbCdMDYUYmpRtEscuIwY1bk+JkvoBk+5P+XnExdlEleLADVcnSL2R/rnAarbv1l6fplHbAcT9uqqPJGkZ2TMoV4UUpzv5TDzNZd/ZGVOzVIfKwOvvQUAyoUoVqeAC8BO3AHA5IuFmmyRkNma0E1h/itlr+BTZW566psS2LgZWTmN21wCUI/jIX4XqY8N6wMXweXRsQ59x2G42kpMwCm8a2ND8Z3QON2br8hR5v1k0v5EMawObaBY0SWX4x6XdqPY5RJ2lsiHc3Q1qTzR/K16ggnvX+tdPePh+69E3hQKoB2Q45IOP5X5Rhsx0Mu0ifOPhX7dJNJ4nX4eVtkxEdXTI9tk6c2VOT8T/yLl8liuWE/lpF+hO/TB1D6VYJSHuE4RnHZE30CXSqmXqVpVg4DPrUy0xasGUoKJ0YLMa5K3hfRsfOsYN5FJd9dpo68umdBaIKj5aZK16jn7IHza7AphlBV0byTtInUM6tFA/8i3/+VPvLgUQRhIRm0xDO3sj0uYipMaSobPNmb2Z3bGbXTDRBmy+UrSNbX+9+cBt0cEEFK6unJhalhxkjAz9hkDsR34t8SHlxKD75D+J+DdzuuyYY2z8fjqov5/6PKevN1b3yrwkyU5WXzhFHIIVMeqv5r1/dZKOjKOtCauKCYbyp3O/3JA4j4Khr3X3ncVgN9r9JgiTmUA65vMLMIx57FXb6AzeDF2I5d0w3HVx0NZ2DvltGcZXKaccfMlYtie/zNsA2+ptOIT3eWuWPfgG5mmuUugK57ufmRfFbO2Miu+xidJ6k/QAEcX/MZI4W5Vqi5a7ZqOwbuLVmP82FQOv+teyMi/gwVXj/CgGj6SXsKxTd8m7uQ9UDWRQ9iDy2wktI1rUdjPDkyIhD75f3n3g9xHwX/JIohHsL6hTWnzETKJ5+u6MhZnARWIj1RXIam5jtXESun4FNI+vg+T20K2AsGQO6dYve7CL9ZpI2INIqyAhZjv5ygSjFp3spU7+PiJ/F2NTrtyRZRyi0PDmXwYq+7lWGow8x/k6E6zTyCRPBcZWaMvyVC1fB/pECoNv58TDU6gFIencaoLN2XCpV2RRxH+fJb0gbdP0JxcRNX2pHDg0hA1pudXKfmirliCqhFwEl/37rCgUV60/lBNl4OEfvI/bWrrlE2B535E/NtmoeubvpWKvYftEYD/if1hQA3yKhm+s45iruYPLsTUTGHkqIrPmyd5Hhj980E6GJPesMJHehFU27djOmY5yxxsmryd78fTh8SXPae4zJDGjoO2B+J2uvnzHfGLCk6VqbJOZHeoAaF+jtPMvHFIKdeqb48MKddD53oYMse4sLIYiQE7Pl7tMkRp6W6kFkVT94U/RIOSOQCfPDrsMuTCt7LIVvb7WNQ/Q/Jg/DCnYj1lZURrpMVnNFBzREN1kB2pefB7+vODYNaEn6kU2uqkazKhU0kekVjLFFD4EByf9LLU1LEEcb0PP9Tkj3RaoJTAJ66fbulGQTW5XAY4fse+ODVIHg+ntUFLuiQOQkjt6OyM/d6qkkwR5LAM139eSbWWOZKK0eAdbvikdixM3Vq8GJNOlhZhNgvKN0j4NYbWhhiVoKjp5wqVtZ33TlGZBcJap47RSIPqQG3F09YnP4gz3Adto3duBCnBhiziCT8CNy4Z06BcVI/CvvAS8GRiZyzrcnGqrcYP0/njo1Jc9OvZ8DOe8qieHozcslF1WKD/OekKtb8kELWonKJKQn+SrKBaD3gC5NLG/1MkiVHfII5a61FiyBhB0l1rC2GReQvV8V/JQkxIdjnNQZp4r62hrdmjGQLGltzX4//3IKGAC5xevEOkA3uF/8A2R0SDiYXYlL6hji/3WEGWprONutF49yA04h6a4SVlUuxU6lG8TeoEXnVAgSnc++rjUF/mLNByqH+HD6ESG6lOHiPpAc3hF+O6c5msZ4phGs0wE8k//z2PgPoR9jRkymdHjs6l6eNc8tntCCslo7xHtIcB6hX1qTa0bggaEtOmLpD/7udsQ+q4zTrHbZKCBHUnGs95n6u+gBaz0GaMBcaVPr76zbj1x4+04C/0uUtqPMDhlV3qNHlozdKONxy7tEo438vQ7t0zlIEDAFrKIkjRiL/wv8BVk8vEuxYUBTfgrHCFH+svySdnJSdTTK1PoETXe42+UQqtHR8Iycl6ytfkQV71qmAceTSg0LsISwzLA1H8n+EKmKRcEraMnUoA

Let me analyze:\n\n**Bug**: Webhook docs are not user-friendly — need copy buttons for curl commands with YOUR_SITE replaced by actual site URL.\n\n**Classification steps:**\n\n1. Read the bug report - done. Two issues: (a) no copy buttons, (b) YOUR_SITE not replaced with actual URL.\n\n2. Is this a styling/UI problem? The copy button is a UI usability feature. The YOUR_SITE replacement is both a functional and UI issue. Let me think...\n   - The copy button is a UI feature/convenience\n   - The YOUR_SITE replacement makes the curl commands actually usable\n   - These aren't purely styling issues — they affect both functionality and usability of the documentation.\n\n3. Looking at the old test entries for WebhookHelpButton, they mention example curl commands and accuracy of URL paths, but nothing about copy buttons or placeholder replacement with actual site URLs.\n\n4. The old entries don't specify the buggy behavior or clarify whether the host should be real or a placeholder — they just say \"correct URL path\" which is vague.\n\n5. The copy button is entirely new functionality with no prior test coverage, while the YOUR_SITE replacement issue stems from underspecified requirements that mention \"correct URL path\" without clarifying the full URL behavior.\n\nThe root problem is in testSpec.md — it didn't specify that curl examples should use the actual deployed site URL instead of a placeholder, and it never mentioned copy functionality at all. AppRevisions.md already has the appropriate documentation updates from the bug fix, so I just need to classify this in bugReports.md.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2339,"cache_read_input_tokens":36746,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2339,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2282bac8-388b-4d9c-9560-45cbd16dca96","uuid":"df035856-bd35-46cf-8714-063e73a92de3"}

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.

Test entries should cover calling each endpoint with valid inputs\n  and verifying the expected side effects (e.g., database records created or updated, status transitions\n  completed, downstream processes triggered).\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":66,"oldLines":8,"newStart":66,"newLines":12,"lines":[" - Apps that receive webhooks from external services must include a webhook help/documentation UI","   accessible from the app's status or admin page.
