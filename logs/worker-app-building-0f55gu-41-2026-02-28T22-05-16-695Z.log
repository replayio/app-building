Now I have all the information needed. Let me understand the data flow:\n\n1. Reports are created via POST to `/.netlify/functions/reports` which creates accounts-based report items\n2. The report creation pulls from `accounts` table (using `budget_amount` and `budget_actual` for variances) and `budgets` table for sub-items\n3. The variance is calculated as `budget_amount - actual_amount` (positive = under budget/favorable, negative = over budget/unfavorable)\n\nThe test spec references specific accounts: Marketing, Operations, R&D, Sales, G&A. I need to create these via the API in `beforeAll`, create budgets for Operations (Cloud Infrastructure, Office Lease, Travel), then create a report.\n\nLet me now write the test file. I'll create a single spec file for all four components since they all operate on the same report details page.\n[write] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow I need to verify that the test will work correctly by checking a few things. Let me verify the report creation flow works correctly with the budget data and the test IDs generated.\n[Task]\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/reports.ts\n[glob] **/*schema*\n[glob] **/*migrations*\n[glob] **/*.sql\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/scripts/schema.ts\n[glob] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/budgets.ts\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/budgets.ts\nThe budgets POST API doesn't accept `actual_amount`, so all sub-items would default to 0. I need to update the API to support setting `actual_amount`. Per the skill guidelines: \"If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\"\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/budgets.ts\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/budgets.ts\nNow let me also verify the CSS file has the right styles and check there's nothing missing from the components. Let me also verify the `formatCurrency` output format.\n$ cd /repo/apps/Accounting && node -e \"\nconst fmt = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD', minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 2 });\nconsole.log(fmt.format(42000));\nconsole.log(fmt.format(4000));\nconsole.log(fmt.format(0));\nconsole.log(fmt.format(1000));\ncons... (truncated)\n$42,000.00\n$4,000.00\n$0.00\n$1,000.00\n$8,500.00\n$3,500.00\nGood. Now let me review the test to make sure it handles the data correctly. Let me think about the test data flow more carefully.\n\nThe report creation POST flow:\n1. Creates a report row\n2. For each account (filtered by `categories_filter: \"expenses\"`), creates an account-level report_item\n3. For each budget under the account, creates a sub-item report_item\n\nAccount-level items use `budget_amount` and `budget_actual` from the accounts table:\n- variance = budget_amount - budget_actual (in reports.ts)\n\nSub-item budget rows use `amount` and `actual_amount` from budgets table:\n- variance = amount - actual_amount (in reports.ts)\n\nBut the test report will include ALL expense accounts (including the seed data ones like Operating Expenses, Payroll, etc.). This could cause issues because:\n1. The variance chart would show more than just our 5 test accounts\n2. The total variance calculation would include seed accounts\n\nLet me reconsider. The seed accounts with category 'expenses' are: Operating Expenses, Payroll Expenses, Rent Expense, Utilities Expense. These all have budget_amount=0 and budget_actual=0, so their variance would be 0.\n\nBut they'd still show up as rows in the table and bars in the chart. Let me verify this is not a problem for the tests.\n\nLooking at the tests:\n- \"VarianceSummary displays Total Variance\" - I check for $ and %, not specific values. The total would include seed accounts with 0 variance, so the total would still be our test accounts' total.\n- \"VarianceChart displays data for all accounts\" - I check for at least 5 bar groups, which works.\n- \"DetailedReportTable multiple accounts are listed\" - I check our 5 specific rows exist, which works.\n\nThis should be fine. But let me double-check the VarianceSummary calculation. The component filters by `item_type === \"account\"` and sums up actuals and budgets. With seed expense accounts having budget_amount=0 and budget_actual=0, they add 0 to the totals.\n\nSo total actual = 42000+17000+30000+28000+28000 = 145000\nTotal budget = 38000+14500+25000+30000+25000 = 132500\nTotal variance = budget - actual = 132500-145000 = -12500 (negative → over budget)\nTotal variance pct = 12500/132500*100 = 9.4% ✓\n\nThis matches the test spec. Now let me also verify that the \"positive variance\" test for VarianceSummary will work. The test creates a single account with budget_amount=50000 and budget_actual=45000. But when creating a report with `categories_filter: \"expenses\"`, it'll include ALL expense accounts ... (truncated)\n\nWait, this could be problematic for the \"positive variance\" test. I need to think about this more carefully. The positive variance test creates a single account and a report. But the report will include all expense accounts (seed ones + all our test accounts from the main test + the new pos account)... (truncated)\n\nActually, looking at the test structure - each `describe` block has its own `beforeAll/afterAll` that creates and cleans up data. But tests across different `describe` blocks run in the SAME worker (same spec file), so they share the same database.\n\nWait, actually looking more carefully: the `beforeAll` and `afterAll` in each describe block create and clean up ctx. But if multiple describe blocks run in sequence, the data from one block might overlap with another.\n\nActually, the bigger issue is: the \"positive variance\" test runs within the VarianceSummary describe block. At that point, the test's `beforeAll` has already created the 5 test accounts. The positive variance test also creates its own account and report. But that report will include ALL expense acco... (truncated)\n\nI need to fix this. Let me restructure the positive variance test to use a different category or to clean up the test accounts first.\n\nActually, a better approach: for the positive variance test, I should use a unique category that only the positive test account belongs to. But the categories are fixed (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses).\n\nAlternative: create the positive account with a unique category that no seed data uses and filter for that category. But categories are constrained to specific values.\n\nLet me think of another approach. I could:\n1. Make the positive account have a large enough budget to outweigh the negatives\n2. Use `categories_filter: null` and create the account in a less-used category  \n3. Actually the cleanest approach: the positive variance test should use `categories_filter: \"revenue\"` since no seed revenue accounts have budgets\n\nWait, let me look at the seed data again. The seed revenue accounts (Service Revenue, Product Revenue) have budget_amount=0 and budget_actual=0. If I create a revenue account with positive variance and create a report filtered to \"revenue\", it would only include revenue accounts. The seed ones add 0... (truncated)\n\nLet me update the positive variance test.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me update the positive variance test in the VarianceSummary section.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow I need to think about another issue: the `beforeAll` hooks in each describe block create and destroy the same data. Since the describe blocks run sequentially in the same worker, this is fine - but we're creating 4 separate sets of test data (one per describe block). This is correct behavior for... (truncated)\n\nHowever, there's a subtle issue: the shared `ctx` variable. When all describe blocks are in the same file, each `beforeAll` will set `ctx` to a new value. This is fine because the blocks run sequentially.\n\nBut actually, there's a potential problem with `beforeAll` in Playwright. In `fullyParallel: true` mode, each test might run in its own worker. Let me check... Actually with `fullyParallel: true`, tests within the same file can run in parallel too. But `beforeAll` is per-worker, and workers are shar... (truncated)\n\nWait, actually in Playwright with `fullyParallel: true`, each test gets its own worker by default. But `beforeAll` runs once per worker. So if each test in a describe block runs in its own worker, `beforeAll` runs for each test — which creates redundant data. This is wasteful but not incorrect.\n\nActually, I should re-read the Playwright docs. With `fullyParallel: true`, tests within a `describe` block CAN run in separate workers. But `beforeAll` is scoped to a worker. So multiple tests sharing `beforeAll` data via a module-level `ctx` variable is problematic because each worker has its own ... (truncated)\n\nLet me restructure to avoid this issue. The safest approach is to navigate to the page in each test and create data per-test or use a fixture approach.\n\nActually, looking at the existing test patterns in the app (accounts-page.spec.ts), they don't use `beforeAll` for data setup — they just use the seed data directly. The delete test creates its own data.\n\nGiven the parallel execution model, I should reconsider. Let me use a shared worker-level fixture instead. Actually, the simplest fix is to use `test.describe.serial()` or to move the data creation into a shared fixture.\n\nBut actually, looking at the Playwright docs more carefully: `beforeAll` is guaranteed to run once per worker, and tests within the same `describe` block that share a worker will all see the same `beforeAll` result. With `fullyParallel: true`, Playwright may assign multiple tests from the same `desc... (truncated)\n\nThe real problem is the shared `ctx` variable at module level. Each worker gets its own module instance, so each worker's `ctx` is independent. This means if two tests from the same describe run in different workers, they each get their own `beforeAll` run, creating their own data, and `ctx` holds t... (truncated)\n\nThis is actually correct. Let me proceed.\n\nBut wait - there's a cleanup issue. If `beforeAll` creates data and `afterAll` cleans it up, but multiple workers run the same describe block, each worker creates and cleans its own data. That's fine for isolation but creates lots of data. Let me simplify by using fewer test data setups.\n\nActually, I think the current approach is reasonable. Let me now run the type check to make sure the test file is valid.\n$ npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json 2>&1 | head -30\n$ npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -30\nNow let me run the quality check as required.\n[grep] npm run check\n[read] /repo/skills/scripts/check.md\n$ npm run check 2>&1\n> accounting@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nThe quality check passes. Now let me review the test file one more time to make sure everything is correct, particularly checking the data flow for the budget sub-items.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me think about a subtle issue with the variance chart test. The chart uses `actual_amount - budget_amount` to determine bar direction, and `isOverBudget` is `actual_amount > budget_amount`. Let me verify:\n\n- Marketing: actual=42000, budget=38000 → value=4000 (positive, over budget → red, above zero)\n- Operations: actual=17000, budget=14500 → value=2500 (positive, over budget → red)  \n- R&D: actual=30000, budget=25000 → value=5000 (positive, over budget → red)\n- Sales: actual=28000, budget=30000 → value=-2000 (negative, under budget → green, below zero)\n- G&A: actual=28000, budget=25000 → value=3000 (positive, over budget → red)\n\nSo Marketing, Operations, R&D, and G&A are over budget (red), and only Sales is under budget (green). The test spec says \"Marketing, Operations, and R&D are over budget\" for red, and \"Sales and G&A are under budget\" for green. But with our data, G&A is also over budget.\n\nLet me fix G&A to be under budget to match the spec.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me recalculate totals:\n- Marketing: actual=42000, budget=38000 → var=-4000 (over)\n- Operations: actual=17000, budget=14500 → var=-2500 (over)\n- R&D: actual=30000, budget=25000 → var=-5000 (over)\n- Sales: actual=28000, budget=30000 → var=2000 (under)\n- G&A: actual=22000, budget=25000 → var=3000 (under)\n\nTotal actual = 42000+17000+30000+28000+22000 = 139000\nTotal budget = 38000+14500+25000+30000+25000 = 132500\nTotal variance = 132500-139000 = -6500 (still negative/over budget)\n\nThe test spec mentions total variance of -$12,500, but that's an example value. My tests don't assert specific total amounts - they check for the presence of negative styling and dollar/percentage signs. Let me verify this by reading the test assertions again.\n\nNow let me also update the comment block at the top to reflect the correct values.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me also check the test for \"VarianceChart under-budget accounts displayed with green bars\" - it only checks Sales, but per the test spec it should also check G&A. Let me also fix the \"over-budget\" test to match the test spec which mentions Marketing, Operations, and R&D.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me read the chart tests to verify the over/under budget assertions.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nI need to update the over-budget test comment to match the actual data (Marketing, Operations, R&D are over budget - G&A is now under budget). Let me also verify the green bars test.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow update the green bars test to check both Sales and G&A.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me also think about the Marketing sub-items. The test for \"multiple accounts can be expanded simultaneously\" expands Marketing and expects sub-items. But in our test data, Marketing doesn't have any budgets (sub-items). Only Operations has budgets. Let me fix that test.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nThe \"multiple accounts can be expanded simultaneously\" test expands both Operations and Marketing. But Marketing might not have sub-items (budgets). The test spec says \"User clicks the expand chevron on 'Marketing'\" and expects sub-items. I need to also create budgets for Marketing.\n\nLet me also add Marketing budgets to the test data setup. The test spec doesn't specify what Marketing's sub-items are, but it just needs to have some so the expand works. Let me add some.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow add the Marketing budgets creation to the `createTestData` function:\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow update the \"multiple accounts can be expanded simultaneously\" test to check for Marketing sub-items:\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me also think about an issue with the `include_zero_balance: false` filter for the positive variance test. The seed revenue accounts have budget_amount=0 AND budget_actual=0. Looking at the filter code:\n\n```typescript\nconst filteredAccounts = include_zero_balance\n  ? accounts\n  : accounts.filter(\n      (a: Record<string, unknown>) =>\n        parseFloat(a.budget_amount as string) !== 0 ||\n        parseFloat(a.budget_actual as string) !== 0\n    );\n```\n\nWith `include_zero_balance: false`, accounts with both budget_amount=0 AND budget_actual=0 will be filtered out. The PosVarTestAcct has budget_amount=50000 and budget_actual=45000, so it passes. The seed revenue accounts (budget_amount=0, budget_actual=0) will be filtered out. \n\nNow let me verify one more thing - the `include_zero_balance` for the main report. I'm using `include_zero_balance: true`, which means it includes ALL expense accounts including seed ones. The seed expense accounts (Operating Expenses, Payroll, Rent, Utilities) all have budget_amount=0 and budget_ac... (truncated)\n\nThis is actually fine - it means the chart shows more than 5 bars, but my tests check for the specific ones. However, the \"VarianceChart bar heights are proportional\" test could be affected if seed accounts appear in between.\n\nActually, the proportionality test just compares Marketing and R&D heights, which is fine regardless of other bars.\n\nLet me now run the full check one more time.\n$ npm run check 2>&1\n> accounting@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nLet me do a final review of the complete test file to make sure everything is consistent.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nI realize the breadcrumb tests are fragile because they use `.nth(1)` to distinguish between the NavBar's breadcrumb and the ReportHeader's breadcrumb. Let me make them more robust by scoping to the report-header element.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nAlso update the \"title reflects specific report\" test to use scoped breadcrumb:\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me run the check one more time to make sure everything still passes.\n$ npm run check 2>&1\n> accounting@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nAll checks pass.

I'll create a single spec file for all four components since they all operate on the same report details page.\n[write] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow I need to verify that the test will work correctly by checking a few things. Let me verify the report creation flow works correctly with the budget data and the test IDs generated.\n[Task]\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/reports.ts\n[glob] **/*schema*\n[glob] **/*migrations*\n[glob] **/*.sql\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/scripts/schema.ts\n[glob] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/budgets.ts\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/budgets.ts\nThe budgets POST API doesn't accept `actual_amount`, so all sub-items would default to 0. I need to update the API to support setting `actual_amount`. Per the skill guidelines: \"If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\"\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/budgets.ts\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/budgets.ts\nNow let me also verify the CSS file has the right styles and check there's nothing missing from the components. Let me also verify the `formatCurrency` output format.\n$ cd /repo/apps/Accounting && node -e \"\nconst fmt = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD', minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 2 });\nconsole.log(fmt.format(42000));\nconsole.log(fmt.format(4000));\nconsole.log(fmt.format(0));\nconsole.log(fmt.format(1000));\ncons... (truncated)\n$42,000.00\n$4,000.00\n$0.00\n$1,000.00\n$8,500.00\n$3,500.00\nGood. Now let me review the test to make sure it handles the data correctly. Let me think about the test data flow more carefully.\n\nThe report creation POST flow:\n1. Creates a report row\n2. For each account (filtered by `categories_filter: \"expenses\"`), creates an account-level report_item\n3. For each budget under the account, creates a sub-item report_item\n\nAccount-level items use `budget_amount` and `budget_actual` from the accounts table:\n- variance = budget_amount - budget_actual (in reports.ts)\n\nSub-item budget rows use `amount` and `actual_amount` from budgets table:\n- variance = amount - actual_amount (in reports.ts)\n\nBut the test report will include ALL expense accounts (including the seed data ones like Operating Expenses, Payroll, etc.). This could cause issues because:\n1. The variance chart would show more than just our 5 test accounts\n2. The total variance calculation would include seed accounts\n\nLet me reconsider. The seed accounts with category 'expenses' are: Operating Expenses, Payroll Expenses, Rent Expense, Utilities Expense. These all have budget_amount=0 and budget_actual=0, so their variance would be 0.\n\nBut they'd still show up as rows in the table and bars in the chart. Let me verify this is not a problem for the tests.\n\nLooking at the tests:\n- \"VarianceSummary displays Total Variance\" - I check for $ and %, not specific values. The total would include seed accounts with 0 variance, so the total would still be our test accounts' total.\n- \"VarianceChart displays data for all accounts\" - I check for at least 5 bar groups, which works.\n- \"DetailedReportTable multiple accounts are listed\" - I check our 5 specific rows exist, which works.\n\nThis should be fine. But let me double-check the VarianceSummary calculation. The component filters by `item_type === \"account\"` and sums up actuals and budgets. With seed expense accounts having budget_amount=0 and budget_actual=0, they add 0 to the totals.\n\nSo total actual = 42000+17000+30000+28000+28000 = 145000\nTotal budget = 38000+14500+25000+30000+25000 = 132500\nTotal variance = budget - actual = 132500-145000 = -12500 (negative → over budget)\nTotal variance pct = 12500/132500*100 = 9.4% ✓\n\nThis matches the test spec. Now let me also verify that the \"positive variance\" test for VarianceSummary will work. The test creates a single account with budget_amount=50000 and budget_actual=45000. But when creating a report with `categories_filter: \"expenses\"`, it'll include ALL expense accounts ... (truncated)\n\nWait, this could be problematic for the \"positive variance\" test. I need to think about this more carefully. The positive variance test creates a single account and a report. But the report will include all expense accounts (seed ones + all our test accounts from the main test + the new pos account)... (truncated)\n\nActually, looking at the test structure - each `describe` block has its own `beforeAll/afterAll` that creates and cleans up data. But tests across different `describe` blocks run in the SAME worker (same spec file), so they share the same database.\n\nWait, actually looking more carefully: the `beforeAll` and `afterAll` in each describe block create and clean up ctx. But if multiple describe blocks run in sequence, the data from one block might overlap with another.\n\nActually, the bigger issue is: the \"positive variance\" test runs within the VarianceSummary describe block. At that point, the test's `beforeAll` has already created the 5 test accounts. The positive variance test also creates its own account and report. But that report will include ALL expense acco... (truncated)\n\nI need to fix this. Let me restructure the positive variance test to use a different category or to clean up the test accounts first.\n\nActually, a better approach: for the positive variance test, I should use a unique category that only the positive test account belongs to. But the categories are fixed (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses).\n\nAlternative: create the positive account with a unique category that no seed data uses and filter for that category. But categories are constrained to specific values.\n\nLet me think of another approach. I could:\n1. Make the positive account have a large enough budget to outweigh the negatives\n2. Use `categories_filter: null` and create the account in a less-used category  \n3. Actually the cleanest approach: the positive variance test should use `categories_filter: \"revenue\"` since no seed revenue accounts have budgets\n\nWait, let me look at the seed data again. The seed revenue accounts (Service Revenue, Product Revenue) have budget_amount=0 and budget_actual=0. If I create a revenue account with positive variance and create a report filtered to \"revenue\", it would only include revenue accounts. The seed ones add 0... (truncated)\n\nLet me update the positive variance test.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me update the positive variance test in the VarianceSummary section.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow I need to think about another issue: the `beforeAll` hooks in each describe block create and destroy the same data. Since the describe blocks run sequentially in the same worker, this is fine - but we're creating 4 separate sets of test data (one per describe block). This is correct behavior for... (truncated)\n\nHowever, there's a subtle issue: the shared `ctx` variable. When all describe blocks are in the same file, each `beforeAll` will set `ctx` to a new value. This is fine because the blocks run sequentially.\n\nBut actually, there's a potential problem with `beforeAll` in Playwright. In `fullyParallel: true` mode, each test might run in its own worker. Let me check... Actually with `fullyParallel: true`, tests within the same file can run in parallel too. But `beforeAll` is per-worker, and workers are shar... (truncated)\n\nWait, actually in Playwright with `fullyParallel: true`, each test gets its own worker by default. But `beforeAll` runs once per worker. So if each test in a describe block runs in its own worker, `beforeAll` runs for each test — which creates redundant data. This is wasteful but not incorrect.\n\nActually, I should re-read the Playwright docs. With `fullyParallel: true`, tests within a `describe` block CAN run in separate workers. But `beforeAll` is scoped to a worker. So multiple tests sharing `beforeAll` data via a module-level `ctx` variable is problematic because each worker has its own ... (truncated)\n\nLet me restructure to avoid this issue. The safest approach is to navigate to the page in each test and create data per-test or use a fixture approach.\n\nActually, looking at the existing test patterns in the app (accounts-page.spec.ts), they don't use `beforeAll` for data setup — they just use the seed data directly. The delete test creates its own data.\n\nGiven the parallel execution model, I should reconsider. Let me use a shared worker-level fixture instead. Actually, the simplest fix is to use `test.describe.serial()` or to move the data creation into a shared fixture.\n\nBut actually, looking at the Playwright docs more carefully: `beforeAll` is guaranteed to run once per worker, and tests within the same `describe` block that share a worker will all see the same `beforeAll` result. With `fullyParallel: true`, Playwright may assign multiple tests from the same `desc... (truncated)\n\nThe real problem is the shared `ctx` variable at module level. Each worker gets its own module instance, so each worker's `ctx` is independent. This means if two tests from the same describe run in different workers, they each get their own `beforeAll` run, creating their own data, and `ctx` holds t... (truncated)\n\nThis is actually correct. Let me proceed.\n\nBut wait - there's a cleanup issue. If `beforeAll` creates data and `afterAll` cleans it up, but multiple workers run the same describe block, each worker creates and cleans its own data. That's fine for isolation but creates lots of data. Let me simplify by using fewer test data setups.\n\nActually, I think the current approach is reasonable. Let me now run the type check to make sure the test file is valid.\n$ npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json 2>&1 | head -30\n$ npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -30\nNow let me run the quality check as required.\n[grep] npm run check\n[read] /repo/skills/scripts/check.md\n$ npm run check 2>&1\n> accounting@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nThe quality check passes. Now let me review the test file one more time to make sure everything is correct, particularly checking the data flow for the budget sub-items.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me think about a subtle issue with the variance chart test. The chart uses `actual_amount - budget_amount` to determine bar direction, and `isOverBudget` is `actual_amount > budget_amount`. Let me verify:\n\n- Marketing: actual=42000, budget=38000 → value=4000 (positive, over budget → red, above zero)\n- Operations: actual=17000, budget=14500 → value=2500 (positive, over budget → red)  \n- R&D: actual=30000, budget=25000 → value=5000 (positive, over budget → red)\n- Sales: actual=28000, budget=30000 → value=-2000 (negative, under budget → green, below zero)\n- G&A: actual=28000, budget=25000 → value=3000 (positive, over budget → red)\n\nSo Marketing, Operations, R&D, and G&A are over budget (red), and only Sales is under budget (green). The test spec says \"Marketing, Operations, and R&D are over budget\" for red, and \"Sales and G&A are under budget\" for green. But with our data, G&A is also over budget.\n\nLet me fix G&A to be under budget to match the spec.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me recalculate totals:\n- Marketing: actual=42000, budget=38000 → var=-4000 (over)\n- Operations: actual=17000, budget=14500 → var=-2500 (over)\n- R&D: actual=30000, budget=25000 → var=-5000 (over)\n- Sales: actual=28000, budget=30000 → var=2000 (under)\n- G&A: actual=22000, budget=25000 → var=3000 (under)\n\nTotal actual = 42000+17000+30000+28000+22000 = 139000\nTotal budget = 38000+14500+25000+30000+25000 = 132500\nTotal variance = 132500-139000 = -6500 (still negative/over budget)\n\nThe test spec mentions total variance of -$12,500, but that's an example value. My tests don't assert specific total amounts - they check for the presence of negative styling and dollar/percentage signs. Let me verify this by reading the test assertions again.\n\nNow let me also update the comment block at the top to reflect the correct values.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me also check the test for \"VarianceChart under-budget accounts displayed with green bars\" - it only checks Sales, but per the test spec it should also check G&A. Let me also fix the \"over-budget\" test to match the test spec which mentions Marketing, Operations, and R&D.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me read the chart tests to verify the over/under budget assertions.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nI need to update the over-budget test comment to match the actual data (Marketing, Operations, R&D are over budget - G&A is now under budget). Let me also verify the green bars test.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow update the green bars test to check both Sales and G&A.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me also think about the Marketing sub-items. The test for \"multiple accounts can be expanded simultaneously\" expands Marketing and expects sub-items. But in our test data, Marketing doesn't have any budgets (sub-items). Only Operations has budgets. Let me fix that test.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nThe \"multiple accounts can be expanded simultaneously\" test expands both Operations and Marketing. But Marketing might not have sub-items (budgets). The test spec says \"User clicks the expand chevron on 'Marketing'\" and expects sub-items. I need to also create budgets for Marketing.\n\nLet me also add Marketing budgets to the test data setup. The test spec doesn't specify what Marketing's sub-items are, but it just needs to have some so the expand works. Let me add some.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow add the Marketing budgets creation to the `createTestData` function:\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow update the \"multiple accounts can be expanded simultaneously\" test to check for Marketing sub-items:\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me also think about an issue with the `include_zero_balance: false` filter for the positive variance test. The seed revenue accounts have budget_amount=0 AND budget_actual=0. Looking at the filter code:\n\n```typescript\nconst filteredAccounts = include_zero_balance\n  ? accounts\n  : accounts.filter(\n      (a: Record<string, unknown>) =>\n        parseFloat(a.budget_amount as string) !== 0 ||\n        parseFloat(a.budget_actual as string) !== 0\n    );\n```\n\nWith `include_zero_balance: false`, accounts with both budget_amount=0 AND budget_actual=0 will be filtered out. The PosVarTestAcct has budget_amount=50000 and budget_actual=45000, so it passes. The seed revenue accounts (budget_amount=0, budget_actual=0) will be filtered out. \n\nNow let me verify one more thing - the `include_zero_balance` for the main report. I'm using `include_zero_balance: true`, which means it includes ALL expense accounts including seed ones. The seed expense accounts (Operating Expenses, Payroll, Rent, Utilities) all have budget_amount=0 and budget_ac... (truncated)\n\nThis is actually fine - it means the chart shows more than 5 bars, but my tests check for the specific ones. However, the \"VarianceChart bar heights are proportional\" test could be affected if seed accounts appear in between.\n\nActually, the proportionality test just compares Marketing and R&D heights, which is fine regardless of other bars.\n\nLet me now run the full check one more time.\n$ npm run check 2>&1\n> accounting@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nLet me do a final review of the complete test file to make sure everything is consistent.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nI realize the breadcrumb tests are fragile because they use `.nth(1)` to distinguish between the NavBar's breadcrumb and the ReportHeader's breadcrumb. Let me make them more robust by scoping to the report-header element.\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nAlso update the \"title reflects specific report\" test to use scoped breadcrumb:\n[edit] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/report-details.spec.ts\nNow let me run the check one more time to make sure everything still passes.\n$ npm run check 2>&1\n> accounting@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nAll checks pass.

After running the deploy command and fixing the script, I'm running the Playwright tests to verify the deployment works correctly.\n\nNow I'm moving on to the Accounting app, which has 4 components. I'm exploring its file structure by listing the apps directory, finding all TypeScript and TSX files, checking the app root, locating source files, Netlify functions, and test files to understand what I'm working with.\n\nI'm also looking for schema and seed files, testing currency formatting with Node, counting test entries in the documentation, verifying how many tests are written in the report details spec, and running type and lint checks to ensure everything is valid.\n\nFor the next task, I need to fix ambiguous language in the CreateReportDialog test spec.\n\nNow I'm exploring the repository structure to locate the test specification file, searching through markdown and JSON files in the Accounting app, and checking git history to understand what changes were made to the testSpec and related commits. I'm searching for pre-select configuration patterns across the Accounting app files. Now I'm looking at the LineageSection flow diagram issue and need to locate backend files related to batch processing, checking the CSS styling and examining how batches are structured in the InventoryTracker app. I'm running through a series of diagnostic commands to understand the test setup and environment configuration—checking CSS classes, environment variables for the Neon database connection, and attempting to run the dashboard tests, though they're timing out. Now I'm moving on to write tests for the SalesCRM UserDetailPage component.\n\nI'm exploring the app structure and looking for existing user-related test files to understand the testing patterns, then checking what backend functions are available in the SalesCRM netlify directory. Exploring the file structure and checking what tables and schemas exist in the codebase, then reviewing the test documentation to understand what's already covered.
