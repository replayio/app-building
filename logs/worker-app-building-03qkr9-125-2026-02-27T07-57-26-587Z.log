Let me look more carefully at what the test docs say about the contact history team member field itself.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1041,"cache_read_input_tokens":48949,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1041,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8a67e389-e9a3-422e-98fd-b84d3821c3c0","uuid":"adc17a5d-3009-4e05-b835-1810ad8970e3"}

This violates the directive.\n\nNow I need to:\n\n1. Add users fetching to the personDetailSlice (or use the global usersSlice)\n2. Fetch users in PersonDetailPage  \n\n\n3. Pass users to ContactHistorySection\n4. Replace the plain input with SearchableSelect in both the add modal and edit form\n\nLooking at the pattern, `clientDetailSlice` has its own `fetchUsers` thunk and stores `users` in state, while `personDetailSlice` doesn't. I should follow the same pattern and add a `fetchUsers` thunk to `personDetailSlice`, add `users` to the state, fetch in `PersonDetailPage`, and pass to `ContactHistorySection`. But I'm wondering if I should use the global `usersSlice` instead, since `ClientDetailPage` uses `client`...\n\nActually, looking closer, `ClientDetailPage` uses `clientDetailSlice.fetchUsers`, not the global `usersSlice`. The global one is only used by `UsersListPage`, so each page's slice fetches its own copy. I'll follow that same pattern for `personDetailSlice`.\n\nNow for the `SearchableSelect` component—it expects `{ id: string, label: string }` and returns the `id` on change, but `performedBy` is currently stored as a user's name string, not an ID. The test data shows entries like \"team member 'Emily R.'\" and the API receives `performedBy: addPerformedBy.trim() || \"System\"`, so it's storing the actual name. I need to map user names to IDs when selecting and back to names when displaying.\n\nThe cleanest approach is to use `SearchableSelect` with user ID as the option ID and user name as the label, track the selected ID in state, then look up the corresponding name when saving to pass as `performedBy`.\n\nNow I should check if there's already test coverage for this behavior.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":479,"cache_read_input_tokens":51549,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":479,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8a67e389-e9a3-422e-98fd-b84d3821c3c0","uuid":"ef54eac5-b528-46e5-a57d-c358d03844c1"}

The subtask says to use `SearchableSelect` specifically. Let me implement the fix.\n\nKey decisions:\n1. The `SearchableSelect` uses `{ id: string, label: string }` options and `onChange` returns an `id`.\n2. The `performedBy` field in the database is a string (user name), not a user ID.\n3. I'll track the selected user ID in state, and when saving, look up the user name to pass as `performedBy`.\n4. For the edit form, when loading an existing entry, I need to find the matching user by name and set the user ID.\n\n\n5. I'll format the user options as `{ id: user.id, label: user.name }` for `SearchableSelect`, then convert the selected ID back to a name when saving.\n\nNow I'm implementing this across the slice, page component, and section component, starting with adding the user fetching logic.","signature":"ErkOCkYICxgCKkBhllnzARgR4HmUdIYutcBLWURwlUQj+RF6RPz7ApOAbQ04elmcxFU37EKsqXYIGPiy+76gr16uLWLY9v3ofmfgEgxDLihEm9d2qTJu1tgaDAsp4y2Aec5UcWsMryIwH7HolcXRzMFD2d2n2CIBAi0r4G7BE9YucofNoVpi/hExjhHd1FIhQ9EpAcuDdg+8KqANQcajfA6kW+MHUtXELSnR+Q+0YF9MyK3OIhIeLdoUTAdtzoqJaR+dwyPfRirOMIi9Fj/CobK2jPMvBY4cFKA28FpHD23k5Fz08xh+GZZOyx6qs1LNRYpXhpPjeZL7MjIhG/U9VXEzX0CjfMUl+Cn/UFUVy6XUojHV5ceBqNv38yiFuYB3ZN/c6bshuSIWM6NWJF48xViyWnVEXe7CFwPQSUfAO/qEHwzaGkSHZSv+sRIl+i0biXenxrVRM/WUlorxiJFaYTDdX9owdZPImdX5dxA4VeROkcJHgbmq0TdI//mkckoIHNw3bx1tw8MziTddD4D7JXli3BMxsPuruCdKEzNhvT6nj4v8X6HkPF9+1h1r57E7lEL6/oM0o2UxCMOr9ERYc4sk0cX8UlEYsCpcsAmLj5JXz+HJNLEEw0LysOaG1a0yFLB2u7k7JDN0WakijWgmaA2o11fHHc5l3y9+zcN/gXQlRzPbAm4B4fJGCBrkJTEdLNhomo6WWvh1SetyJeorC8rUCA+bgp6QWi4zNUW4lbx+UeCd7LrGiQJSMOScUBSVsyIdJrkAWW0yVonAtG/6gN/iL+JtkZBzs4XYwGYKqNFnbUnWRQrNxRxYmOpSAaPZXjvHS5x2Sz9ouZTC+YPFdXmN0jofQDyL7TKOgQBXEWRcTaTo4218e4onUKwDqghX/qKxAFPvv43hVbcswxykKRg3uOxTVwni1jHjQl5yCdWLCx9lH7XynNsHlotbofYc/GAOWKauW2dGdMc91xCHt0Bvhoy3zmemJxsDwiJ/3gd7PlcY9Nh4CEteHfd2y3hAs/0a75TRFUg1+5hdhZNBa69zoTFoFHg6BgQwYgq2n5bupvlY9CYKWgg/+vB0+V/Nkzq5Ijor3ewj94CF20oPz1bAw19RFPGPODJ67Mpw5Z5cggM2F0VpwQF7a1Lu/u0hEvvyOg/BIZiA0qPsiV/Iz/SvJUjDtGZWAWKiHQ8DCaM6c8LwnO/c4RGCneCXtPowpbfbZabjWY50zNHmg/65CLayZXflhPfZr2YVhKJen0KF4pwBmzZV4A5/DnwkJzgx5LLvXml93+BPFfanR7YnpwWiNYsNovFqX/E4tyjSTTl6w3uIlBL7x3yB+jGCdYPW8x3fejEG27/ktxjKuZgqugsFLtjmxKfbyQ9+1gg50HCD/QU2LkSe5b0D7Rd8ixaIeKnnuCw4vwjRe4PCY5+S6/wdzkamCiCdAjYyXKD88Vgm1yB+WV7cufN7HQASfimfwcyoxAkCNiYdCx5JtbyJr3hBhtLPmkVrBe85i5uzZrN0XEJAnR7AcdXNuK7QUWqcFyi10DrQ8CK1B3vnlrvCbO2poqZ8k1GJNPZ/X7SYAJ4ql1EdTLODPZ6GDsJ4QHhBUUqW52N0J/YCiQvBDmF3cWPNnCwKGqQjQalWcixk7W506tK2DeTG2KllYNqVqrv2G7+C/XEfkhb9oXrNqUuK0tGwW/mAVcU7Szn7TEgxjC+xQk5sChOaf5eIVWxnLr+zSAYf2n54d4T4/ktRBpfpNBPqnD5Idk5c1Qzavh0Rj5jeu8UvMQAzqMqZ7/cttILsJSG5webUzMJLjW3wQbFIp64XndkTEmQ/0Ip+/NpXDYPg7WCoFg1ZfDNV/KqDPz/hZ2MR9bd0VJTn0TJ2Z9udaWH674u26j8xkfL9ARQLXCydMe1JUdlpJcZYjv1XhoqM2Gb+m0DdIp36JHO6zBzVmpZR2BoRNx/UCGR/sOVG2OGOGtHuSrJmoQJyup0v+bdT0r9dlQ0tCJ5irJ6ZTdhYpaGfFmgo3X6PjVhKZaKi4+xiMLcHQ/5rEODtNglIzA2FnpAz11EsR+WO0kmtFEkt0fGyWMO6I9eECFKaPWISwp9STWJeDJ7FvQPuxYC5EluHd++GpaIdr3Vyfv0HLBV0z0G5Z6DYxsIYvc0dals54lTFYNhOF1RoVTQ3x36RKsJMZsUohZLb30/20qGT6Cba0+41Ccv957KLIqBvLeQmGeBSgjSPvBNGKMkJYlk1isn3h+moOI5pmw9WJ50Ajb94MkXZEMtTlBMiPLoV/o0OXdG8uAleQ3WBWf3877ToenifoztCM4mQUArpFhRbNjaCpVP/jEC68xDOm5Hb7YrBcov1JGbHyvetxpzQnFAISCXi3Rp8IhsFfR519aVtFwKUkwOkv9k8TLw0VYyJgsJ+j7+haxebSW3WoXaqi5LgaFlTM1V+74qaVUhCg9VZ0/1ouGTolnh0wvAKFzWUdBgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1734,"cache_read_input_tokens":53717,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1734,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8a67e389-e9a3-422e-98fd-b84d3821c3c0","uuid":"44e05928-e9d6-4fdf-b988-098dbdd65631"}

(Sales Lead)\" which include role information that won't match the user names from the API. I think the approach should be to have the SearchableSelect show user names with their IDs as the underlying value, then when saving, look up the full name from the selected user ID to store in the database.\n\nFor edge cases where a name doesn't exist in the system anymore—like \"System\" or a departed team member—the form just won't pre-select anything, which seems acceptable. Let me start building this out.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":321,"cache_read_input_tokens":59659,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":321,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8a67e389-e9a3-422e-98fd-b84d3821c3c0","uuid":"0fbf465c-49c5-405c-874d-af06b89597a3"}

No Dashboard, Reports, or other placeholder links are shown.\n\n**Clients link navigates to /clients**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Clients\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /clients and the ClientsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Contacts link navigates to /contacts**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Contacts\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /contacts and the ContactsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Deals link navigates to /deals**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Deals\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /deals and the DealsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Tasks link navigates to /tasks**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Tasks\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /tasks and the TasksListPage is displayed.\n\n**Team link navigates to /users**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Team\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /users and the UsersListPage is displayed.\n\n**Settings link navigates to /settings**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Settings\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /settings and the SettingsPage is displayed.\n\n**Active link is visually highlighted for current page**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the \"Clients\" sidebar link has a visually distinct active state (e.g., highlighted background or bold text), and all other links appear in their default inactive style. The same highlighting applies to whichever page is current — navigating to /deals highlights \"Deals\", navigating to /tasks highlights \"Tasks\", etc.\n\n**Active state updates on navigation**\nGiven the user is on /clients with the \"Clients\" link highlighted, when they click the \"Deals\" link, the highlight moves from \"Clients\" to \"Deals\" and the app navigates to /deals.\n\n**Sidebar persists across page navigation**\nWhen the user navigates between pages (e.g., from /clients to /deals to /tasks), the sidebar remains visible and does not re-mount or lose state.\n\n#### SidebarAuth\n\n**Sign In button displays when not authenticated**\nGiven the user is not logged in, the sidebar user area (upper left, below the app title) shows a \"Sign In\" button. No avatar, name, or sign-out control is visible.\n\n**Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form**\nGiven the user is not authenticated, when they click the \"Sign In\" button, an inline form appears within the sidebar containing: an email input field, a password input field, a \"Sign In\" submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch to \"Sign Up\" mode.\n\n**Sign In form submission with valid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters a valid email and password and clicks the \"Sign In\" submit button, the user is authenticated, the inline form disappears, and the sidebar user area shows the user's avatar (or initials), name, and a sign-out button.\n\n**Sign In form shows error for invalid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters an invalid email/password combination and clicks \"Sign In\", an error message is displayed within the form and the form remains visible for correction.\n\n**Sign In / Sign Up toggle switches form mode**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user clicks the \"Sign Up\" toggle, the form switches to Sign Up mode — the submit button text changes to \"Sign Up\" and the toggle text changes to allow switching back to \"Sign In\". Clicking the toggle again returns to Sign In mode.\n\n**Sign Up form submission creates account (test mode)**\nGiven the inline auth form is in Sign Up mode, when the user fills in an email and password and clicks \"Sign Up\", in test mode (IS_TEST=true) the account is auto-confirmed, the user is immediately logged in, and the sidebar shows avatar/name/sign-out. In production mode, a message indicates a confirmation email has been sent.\n\n**Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible, when the user clicks the \"Forgot password?\" link, the app navigates to /auth/forgot-password.\n\n**Avatar and name display when authenticated**\nGiven the user is logged in, the sidebar user area (upper left, below app title) displays the user's avatar (or initials fallback), their display name, and a sign-out control. The \"Sign In\" button is not visible.\n\n**Sign Out returns to unauthenticated state**\nGiven the user is logged in and their avatar/name is displayed in the sidebar, when they click the sign-out button, the user is logged out, the avatar/name/sign-out controls disappear, and the \"Sign In\" button reappears in the sidebar user area.\n\n**Auth state persists across page navigation**\nGiven the user is logged in, when they navigate between different pages (e.g., /clients to /deals to /settings), their avatar, name, and sign-out button remain visible in the sidebar user area throughout.\n\n---\n\n## ClientsListPage (/clients)\n\n### Components: ClientsListHeader, ClientsSearchAndFilters, ClientsTable, ClientsPagination, AddClientModal, ImportDialog\n\n#### ClientsListHeader\n\n**Page title displays \"Clients\"**\nGiven the user navigates to /clients, the page displays the heading \"Clients\" at the top left of the content area.\n\n**Import button is visible with icon and label**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the header area displays an \"Import\" button with a download/import icon and the text \"Import\".\n\n**Import button opens ImportDialog**\nGiven the user is on /clients, when they click the \"Import\" button, an ImportDialog modal opens for importing clients from CSV.\n\n**Export button is visible with icon and label**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the header area displays an \"Export\" button with an export icon and the text \"Export\".\n\n**Export button triggers CSV download**\nGiven the user is on /clients, when they click the \"Export\" button, a CSV file containing the current clients data is downloaded.
