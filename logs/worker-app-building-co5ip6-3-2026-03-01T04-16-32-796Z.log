When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Directly below this selector, there is a prominent 'Request an app' call-to-action (CTA) button or section that navigates the user to the RequestPage.

Below the main info section, there is a chronological feed or activity log showing the AI output while developing the app (e.g., status updates, logs, intermediate reasoning or steps). For in-progress apps, this feed is actively updated in real time or via periodic refresh, so the user can watch the development process as it happens. For completed or queued apps, the feed shows the historical development output or indicates that development has not yet started, respectively.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdR5c80FCuTrISNsDvKXJtHUEOBkned31bC8VP\n    13→\n    14→3.

After submission, the system assesses whether the request fits policy and technical requirements (e.g., no personal information, disallowed content, or other restricted criteria). Based on this assessment, the wizard either (a) rejects the request, displaying a clear rejection message and a reason for rejection, or (b) accepts the request, queues the app for autonomous building, and then shows a confirmation screen with a link to the new app’s AppPage where the user can monitor its progress. The layout should guide the user step-by-step, indicate progress through the wizard, handle validation errors, and clearly communicate the outcome of the assessment.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kds5EP7hTtGH82bSwipudoBvMJrNqh1kgO3jVR\n    17→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01WPq6jbaYFjdnBz8yvLJqch","session_id":"1aad5e47-1d25-4696-a5d0-c9d0b022b78a","uuid":"439999e1-c9fe-469d-8a70-d07a2b58ec6a"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n   102→  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n   103→  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n   104→  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n   105→  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n   106→  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n   107→  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n   108→\n   109→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   110→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   111→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   112→\n   113→## Tips\n   114→\n   115→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   116→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   117→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   118→  ```ts\n   119→  build: {\n   120→    sourcemap: true,\n   121→    minify: false,\n   122→  },\n   123→  define: {\n   124→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   125→  },\n   126→  ```\n   127→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   128→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   129→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   130→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   131→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   132→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   133→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   134→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   135→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   136→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   137→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   138→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   139→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   140→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   141→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   142→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   143→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   144→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   145→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   146→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   147→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   148→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   149→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   150→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   151→\n   152→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   153→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   154→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   155→\n   156→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   157→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   158→\n   159→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   160→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   161→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   162→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   163→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   164→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01WPq6jbaYFjdnBz8yvLJqch","session_id":"1aad5e47-1d25-4696-a5d0-c9d0b022b78a","uuid":"4744d842-2250-45b8-83eb-721dbfce0847"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n   314→  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n   315→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   316→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   317→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   318→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   319→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   320→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   321→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   322→- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n   323→  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n   324→  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n   325→- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n   326→  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n   327→  cold start latency.\n   328→- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   329→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   330→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   331→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n   332→  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n   333→  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n   334→- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n   335→  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n   336→  prevent with a quick source check.\n   337→- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n   338→  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n   339→  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n   340→  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n   341→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01WPq6jbaYFjdnBz8yvLJqch","session_id":"1aad5e47-1d25-4696-a5d0-c9d0b022b78a","uuid":"ce01483c-cd95-4d7c-b225-351562f6787c"}

You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01WPq6jbaYFjdnBz8yvLJqch","session_id":"1aad5e47-1d25-4696-a5d0-c9d0b022b78a","uuid":"e9fc2591-01b8-4d61-a337-d175c38808bc"}

Webhook & Container Spawning Endpoints\n\n#### **POST /.netlify/functions/spawn-container** (spawn-container.ts)\n- **Purpose**: Synchronous entry point to spawn a new container\n- **Authentication**: Bearer token in `Authorization` header or `secret` query parameter (compared to `WEBHOOK_SECRET`)\n- **Request Body**: `{ prompt?: string }`\n- **Returns**: `{ name: containerName, status: 'pending', prompt }`\n- **Flow**:\n  1. Validates webhook secret\n  2. Retrieves prompt from body OR falls back to `default_prompt` from settings table\n  3. Creates a \"pending\" container record in database with unique ID (e.g., `app-building-abc123`)\n  4. Triggers background function via HTTP fetch (fire-and-forget)\n  5. Returns immediately with pending status\n\n#### **POST /.netlify/functions/spawn-container-background** (spawn-container-background.ts) \n- **Purpose**: Background worker (15-min execution limit) that actually creates Fly.io machines\n- **Handler Type**: Netlify Background Function (v1 handler format)\n- **Authentication**: Bearer token validation\n- **Request Body**: `{ containerName, prompt, imageRef, flyApp, flyToken }`\n- **Environment Variables Passed to Container**:\n  - `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` / `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`\n  - `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME` / `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`\n  - `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`\n  - `PORT: 3000`\n  - `CONTAINER_NAME`: The container ID\n  - `PROMPT`: The prompt to build with\n  - `WEBHOOK_URL`: Optional callback URL for events\n- **Flow**:\n  1. Validates authentication\n  2. Calls `createMachine()` from `@replayio/app-building` to spin up a Fly.io machine\n  3. Calls `waitForMachine()` to poll until the machine is ready\n  4. Updates database: container status → \"started\"\n  5. If failure, updates status → \"failed\" and logs error\n\n#### **POST /.netlify/functions/app-builder-event** (app-builder-event.ts)\n- **Purpose**: Webhook receiver for events sent FROM containers back to the platform\n- **Authentication**: Bearer token validation\n- **Request Body**: `{ container_id, event_type, payload?, status? }`\n- **Flow**:\n  1. Validates secret & required fields\n  2. Updates or inserts container record with new `status` (if provided)\n  3. Inserts event into `webhook_events` table with payload (stored as JSONB)\n  4. Returns `{ success: true }`\n- **Used By**: Running containers send progress events, completion signals, etc.\n\n#### **GET /.netlify/functions/status** (status.ts)\n- **Purpose**: Returns current system state (read-only, no auth required)\n- **Returns**: \n  ```json\n  {\n    \"containers\": [{ container_id, name, status, prompt, last_event_at }, ...],\n    \"webhookEvents\": [{ id, container_id, event_type, payload, received_at }, ...],\n    \"defaultPrompt\": \"string or null\"\n  }\n  ```\n- **Notes**: Only returns containers where `status != 'stopped'`; limits webhook events to 50 most recent\n\n---\n\n### 3. Database Schema (scripts/schema.ts)\n\n**Tables:**\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| **apps** | App metadata | id (PK), name, description, status (queued/building/finished), progress (0-100), model, deployment_url, source_url, created_at |\n| **app_requests** | User app requests & assessment | id (PK), name, description, requirements, status (pending/accepted/rejected), rejection_reason, app_id (FK), created_at |\n| **activity_log** | AI development output for an app | id (PK), app_id (FK), timestamp, log_type (INIT/PLAN/REASONING/TEST/DEPLOY), message, detail, expandable (bool) |\n| **containers** | Running/stopped build containers | container_id (PK), name, status, prompt, created_at, last_event_at |\n| **webhook_events** | Event stream from containers | id (PK), container_id (FK), event_type, payload (JSONB), received_at |\n| **settings** | Global config | key (PK, \"default_prompt\"), value |\n\n**Indices**: Optimized for queries by status, app_id, timestamp, and received_at\n\n---\n\n### 4. AppSpec.md Summary\n\n**Spec defines 3 pages with 25+ behavioral requirements:**\n\n**MainPage**:\n- Status filter (Building, Finished, Queued tabs) — Building is default\n- \"Request an app\" CTA button\n- App cards showing title, description, progress bar, and \"View App\" button\n- 2-column grid layout\n- Empty state handling\n\n**AppPage**:\n- App header with title, description, status badge (color-coded), metadata (created date, model, deployment)\n- Action buttons: \"Open Live App\" (enabled only if deployed), \"Download Source Code\" (enabled only if finished)\n- Activity log with live updates for building apps\n- Activity entries with icons, timestamps, type tags (INIT, PLAN, REASONING, TEST, DEPLOY), and expandable code sections\n- Back button to return to dashboard\n\n**RequestPage** (Wizard):\n- Step 1: Describe form (App Name, Description, Requirements fields with validation)\n- Step 2: Assessment screen with progress bar showing policy/technical checks\n- Step 3: Result screen (either rejection with reason or acceptance with \"Go to AppPage\" CTA)\n- Wizard stepper showing progress\n- Edit button on rejection to go back to step 1\n\n**StatusPage** (System admin view):\n- Default prompt display\n- Active containers table (Name, Status, Prompt, Last Event columns)\n- Recent webhook events feed with payload summary\n- Webhook documentation button (modal with curl examples for 3 endpoints)\n\n---\n\n### 5. AppRevisions.md Summary\n\nKey backend integration points:\n\n- Use `@replayio/app-building` npm package for container lifecycle\n- Start containers: `startRemoteContainer(config, repo)`\n- Track state via `ContainerRegistry`\n- Communicate with containers: `httpGet`/`httpPost` with `httpOptsFor(state)`\n- **State mapping to UI**:\n  - \"Building\" = live containers from `findAlive()`\n  - \"Finished\" = stopped/completed containers in registry\n  - \"Queued\" = database apps with no container started yet\n- Stop containers on completion: `stopRemoteContainer(config, state)`\n\n---\n\n### 6. Tests.md (Behavioral Specification)\n\n**Comprehensive test spec with ~130 test cases covering:**\n\n- **StatusFilter**: Tab switching, filtering, empty states\n- **AppCard**: Display, progress bars (0%, mid%, 100%), navigation\n- **AppCardGrid**: 2-column layout, filtering, updates\n- **AppHeader**: Title, status badges (color-coded), metadata display\n- **AppActions**: Open Live App button (enabled for finished only), Download Source Code (enabled for finished only)\n- **ActivityLog**: Live feed vs historical, auto-updates, refresh button, empty states\n- **ActivityLogEntry**: Timestamps, type tags, icons, expandable sections, clickable links\n- **WizardStepper**: Three-step progress indicator (non-clickable)\n- **DescribeAppForm**: Three text fields, validation (required name/description, min lengths), submission\n- **AssessmentScreen**: Loading state with progress bar, request summary panel\n- **RejectionResult**: Warning icon, reason box, edit button returns to step 1 with pre-filled form\n- **AcceptanceResult**: Checkmark, success message, link to app page, \"View all My Apps\" link\n- **StatusPage**: Back link, default prompt display, active containers table, webhook events feed, help modal\n\n---\n\n### 7. writeApp.md Skill (Build Guidelines)\n\n**Key Directives:**\n\n- Write clean, fully functional code with real database backing\n- All JSX must be componentized into separate files\n- Use CSS files with style variables (check `AppStyle.md`)\n- Always define `initSchema()` in `scripts/schema.ts` — single source of truth for database\n- Run `npm run check` from app directory, not repo root\n- Add `data-testid` attributes to interactive elements during development\n- Set `base = \"apps/AppName\"` in netlify.toml; pass `--functions ./netlify/functions` to netlify dev\n- Use Neon serverless driver with tagged template literals only (`` sql`...` ``)\n- Convert empty strings to null with `||` not `??`\n- Never use native `<select>` elements; use custom dropdowns\n- Long-running operations must use Netlify Background Functions (`-background.ts` suffix, v1 handler format)\n- Production builds: `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, React development mode\n- Attach `data-testid` on containers, list items, buttons\n\n---\n\n### 8. testing.md Skill (Replay.io Integration)\n\n**Critical Points:**\n\n- All tests must use Replay browser via `@replayio/playwright`\n- Install with: `npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test`\n- Run: `npx replayio install` once per container\n- Playwright config must spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` in `use` config\n- Timeouts must be generous: `actionTimeout: 15000`, `navigationTimeout: 30000`\n- Debugging workflow:\n  1. Run `npm run test <file>`\n  2. If failure, find recording ID in summary or log file\n  3. Run Replay MCP tools to analyze (PlaywrightSteps, DescribePoint, Evaluate, etc.)\n  4. Write bug report to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with Evidence → Determination → Root Cause\n  5. Fix code or test based on findings\n  6. Commit with message: `CHANGESET REVISION: <hash> FAILING TEST: <name>`\n\n**Key Replay Tools**: `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps`, `mcp__replay__DescribePoint`, `mcp__replay__Evaluate`, `mcp__replay__InspectElement`, `mcp__replay__ReactComponentTree`, `mcp__replay__Logpoint`\n\n---\n\n### 9. Frontend Data Flow\n\n**Redux Store Structure:**\n\n- **appsSlice**: `{ items, loading, error, activeFilter }` — stores all apps, fetched from `/.netlify/functions/apps`\n- **activitySlice**: `{ entries, loading, error }` — activity log for a single app, fetched from `/.netlify/functions/activity/{appId}`\n- **requestSlice**: `{ step, appName, appDescription, appRequirements, assessmentResult, rejectionReason, createdAppId, submitting, error }`\n- **statusSlice**: `{ containers, webhookEvents, defaultPrompt, loading, initialized, error }` — fetched from `/.netlify/functions/status`\n\n**Polling**:\n- AppPage polls activity every 5 seconds when status is \"building\"\n- StatusPage polls status every 10 seconds\n\n---\n\n### 10. Known Issues (Bug Reports)\n\n**Open Bugs:**\n\n1. **3/1/2026**: Webhook docs are not user-friendly — need a copy button for curl commands with `YOUR_SITE` replaced by actual site URL\n2. **3/1/2026**: Container spawn endpoint does not work — testing/curling the webhook fails to create container with supplied or default prompt\n\n**Impact**: Second bug blocks core functionality — spawning containers is essential for the app-building loop\n\n---\n\n### 11.

The bug says \"the endpoint to spawn a container does not work — after redeploying the app, testing and curling the webhook fails to create a container with the supplied or default prompt.\"\n\nLet me look at the key issue: the `spawn-container.ts` uses the v2 handler format (it exports a default async function that takes a `Request` and returns a `Response`). The `spawn-container-background.ts` uses the v1 handler format (it exports `handler: Handler`).\n \nNow I'm seeing the actual problem: `spawn-container.ts` is trying to trigger the background function with a fetch call to `/.netlify/functions/spawn-container-background`, but background functions in Netlify work differently than regular functions. The v1 format with the `-background` suffix is correct, but the way it's being invoked as an HTTP endpoint might be the issue — background functions are meant to be triggered asynchronously, not called like regular HTTP endpoints. I'm realizing the real problem might be that Netlify functions have a timeout limit, and the fire-and-forget fetch in `spawn-container.ts` doesn't guarantee the background function will complete before the parent function terminates. I'm seeing the issue now — the v2 function is making an HTTP call to invoke the background function, but there's a mismatch in how they're communicating. The fetch includes auth headers and a JSON payload, but I need to verify whether the background function endpoint is actually set up to receive and process this request correctly. The background function should receive the original request data including the auth header, so validation should work. But I'm wondering if there's a difference in how Netlify invokes background functions versus regular ones—maybe the handler format between v1 and v2 is causing the issue.\n\nActually, I think I found it. The `spawn-container.ts` file is constructing the site URL from the request headers, but then...\n\nExamining the fetch call more closely...\n\nThe background function is being invoked via HTTP, which should work in production, but the real issue might be that the background function itself is failing silently. Let me trace through what could go wrong—the auth validation, the container creation logic, or maybe the environment variables aren't set up correctly in the background function context.\n\nLooking at how `spawn-container` sends the request, it's passing `flyToken` and `flyApp` from environment variables in the request body, which is a security risk but should functionally work. The question is whether these values are actually available when the background function runs.\n\nWhen `spawn-container.ts` makes a fetch to the background function, Netlify returns a 202 immediately and processes the request asynchronously. The issue might be that background functions behave differently locally with `netlify dev`, or there's something about how the request data gets passed through to the handler that's causing the problem.\n\nThe bug report specifically mentions the webhook fails after redeploying, so this is a production issue. I need to figure out whether \"fails\" means the endpoint returns an error or if it succeeds but the container never actually gets created. If the curl passes authentication and validation, it would create a pending database record and return success, then the background function would handle the actual container creation. Let me check if there's a compatibility issue between the v2 format function calling the v1 background function, or if I need to look at the Netlify configuration to understand how this is deployed. me look at the netlify.toml and other config files.\n\nActually wait, let me reconsider the core issue. Looking at the code again, `spawn-container.ts` is a v2 Netlify Function that receives a standard `Request` object, while `spawn-container-background.ts` is a v1 function with the `-background` suffix. When the v2 function fetches `/.netlify/functions/spawn-container-background`, it triggers the background function which returns 202 immediately and runs asynchronously.\n\nI'm wondering if the background function is actually being triggered correctly. Let me check the `@replayio/app-building` package—the background function imports `createMachine` and `waitForMachine`, but AppRevisions.md describes using `startRemoteContainer` and `ContainerRegistry` instead. These might be different APIs or the package API could have evolved since the documentation was written. /`waitForMachine` directly. This could be the issue — maybe the API is different from what was expected.\n\nBut I can't verify the actual `@replayio/app-building` package API without looking at it. Let me check.\n\nActually, let me step back and think about what the most likely bug is. The bug report says \"the endpoint to spawn a container does not work.\" Given the code:\n\n1. `spawn-container.ts` validates auth, prompt, creates pending record, triggers background function\n2. `spawn-container-background.ts` validates auth, creates machine, waits for machine, updates DB\n\nThe most likely issues could be:\n1. The background function never runs (fire-and-forget fetch fails silently)\n2. The background function fails to auth (but auth looks correct)\n3. The `createMachine`/`waitForMachine` API calls fail\n4. Some environment variable is missing\n\nWait, I think I found it. Looking at the fetch call more carefully — it's making a request to the function's own site using the `URL` environment variable or the request host. Netlify functions can call other functions via HTTP, but this is a fire-and-forget pattern that silently catches errors, which means failures could go unnoticed.\n\nThe real issue is likely that the fetch isn't actually completing before the serverless runtime terminates the function execution context. Even though Node.js would normally keep the event loop alive, in a serverless environment the runtime may kill the process immediately after the function returns, before the fetch request is even sent. The fetch call isn't awaited, so the function returns before the request completes—which is problematic in serverless environments since the runtime might shut down the event loop before the HTTP request finishes. I'm questioning whether Netlify's v2 runtime actually waits for unawaited promises or if this pattern would fail in practice.\n\nThe real issue is likely that the fire-and-forget fetch in the spawn-container function never actually sends the request before the serverless execution context freezes. The fix would be to await the initial fetch to ensure the 202 response is received, while still letting the background function run asynchronously afterward.\n\nWriting the corrected fetch pattern... I'm reconsidering whether awaiting the fetch is actually the issue here—since Netlify returns a 202 response almost immediately, the await should resolve quickly anyway. Let me look deeper into the actual configuration and API usage to find what might really be causing the problem, checking the netlify.toml, package.json, and whether the Replay.io functions I'm

The `@replayio/app-building` package exports both:\n\n1. Low-level Fly.io API functions: `createMachine`, `waitForMachine` (from `fly.ts`)\n2. Higher-level container management: `startRemoteContainer`, `stopRemoteContainer`, `ContainerConfig`, etc. (from `container.ts`)\n\nThe `spawn-container-background.ts` uses the low-level `createMachine`/`waitForMachine` API, which creates a Fly machine directly. But it doesn't pass a `repo` option or use the higher-level `startRemoteContainer` API that the AppRevisions.md recommends.\n\n\nBut the actual issue might be elsewhere. The error message mentions \"fails to create a container with the supplied or default prompt,\" so I need to check what `startRemoteContainer` does differently to understand where the real problem lies.","signature":"EpgHCkYICxgCKkAxhh+z3r4HoqkyfciTHr7r5hAd1y6pbNpPzI/z0AtUNXYQn2IbhlpLn/YGZkJbwp5B/VxNw1Lwg25kgUzVsgFMEgxuZVOgvHjHkFGPDfgaDJ5obtk9JHc3ZizQ1yIwf3kHYauvK/NpdfESwsHzCupc5oxRINWHWlcRBMr3H93VWy7R+Q1iZqO+BBzSNSktKv8FFDU3KQ468kGCexH/KaxOTlUfd2GK/2eK4bwojKE1vchdDVgT6E+IeGPU0V8gAdzajl+dAoO7j8a3A41nR+r6jeBfu6kz+oC+AgKhxPHLitExJUrFshQfkDExcEzlbJ+sIHTqDDCfpwYYStjm/zJoB2kv5JV/22SSG1BKXms2oA7MsRzluAmuWK/hj8eyQL2vbRTRzMYkRmweDOWhZWAySwXl21nEGiGjHFpHZPBX6RKMfR0ovHgjCmI0l4M7kHbHJN/T80ay4iM5YVlPCYEk1jjB0Zsb3voDKJk4fqUTyJJyZHx/vr8uJQ3vS4dgB2BCYCIQLjYAzZnNTraHrHzrSapLhAfxW9e6n/ILQrr8PAjsF2ZtVsIGIo27m0vTGQc47EQGlzrxf/7PaV/AS4LuIuiO7Dv3DrGSC+ehm4AV1gDT62urbxCkTfDjYoUWkaGHY2mddPiyr46lnACgdJY6dStesyR65JbWI8NG8OhzCNCz8o0ddAdRnYkTy9AJr35YY0f82LhVZwmFwx8MLGW7MyUk4k0Gji/nk3efut2S1lo+V54zXbLGvImUehoOvZFmF1d+nYgpfLtXI/q0e8gn4OBA9ahB2cPWk7Qk7eVRyJ/HHeTxNO+IuTAaLbgOV5bBkVy4y8W8Xs6PAsCnW+aQkl1SVysUSAODWl3LHlQEjpENd/10y8PTD3xCQzMvmEhoMBqu5xElyPhClke8innsXczvDo9YPHfHGkgYx4kJLP4QuNOBz3EDPfY4EVDY2fihTBUoUZqWYkSEjag71H6KJHWz10700eTCH9c8fULVvm7Kg36R4gFndZD1nJfQUJAkMMklR/sOtgq4hxN3PNY4A+0grkvbS/b83prxt42I2eRttlbhK6a390vggvdUHAIlDWMKrPuW6huObV6TBwefKeboS97dvCMPyHT6RVehyZhAUqfWO3/euwG9wxO6W9mJb0mz5cw6iXV74yJ6O3wHkKVh7gjdoAbGNfRutFIqkPRKPjgd6r7XY6D3/pUOJZYYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1199,"cache_read_input_tokens":42709,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1199,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1aad5e47-1d25-4696-a5d0-c9d0b022b78a","uuid":"594209f1-3ecf-4971-a0bf-b83f35c2c826"}

[2026-03-01T04:02:42.195Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01PMVrxxnZSmTWHLcrhnJrRX","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a much clearer picture. Let me compare what `startRemoteContainer` does vs what `spawn-container-background.ts` does:\n\n**`startRemoteContainer` (the library function):**\n1. Validates flyToken and flyApp\n2. Gets imageRef from config or `getImageRef()`\n3. Generates unique container name\n4. Builds container env using `buildContainerEnv(repo, config.envVars, remoteExtra)` — which includes **REPO_URL, CLONE_BRANCH, PUSH_BRANCH** from the `repo` parameter, plus git author/committer env vars, PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH, plus custom envVars, plus PORT, CONTAINER_NAME, and optional WEBHOOK_URL\n\n\n5. Strips out FLY_API_TOKEN and FLY_APP_NAME before passing to the machine\n6. Lists existing machines, creates a new one with retry logic to handle manifest errors, logs the agent state, waits for startup, polls until the HTTP server responds, then returns the agent state\n\n**`spawn-container-background.ts` (the current implementation):**\n1. Validates auth\n2. Parses body for containerName, prompt, imageRef, flyApp, flyToken\n3. Builds containerEnv with: GIT_AUTHOR/\n\nCOMMITTER, PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH, PORT, CONTAINER_NAME, PROMPT, optional WEBHOOK_URL\n4. Calls `createMachine` without retry logic\n5. Calls `waitForMachine`\n6. Updates DB status to 'started'\n\nThe critical gap is that `spawn-container-background.ts` is missing REPO_URL, CLONE_BRANCH, and PUSH_BRANCH in the environment — variables that `startRemoteContainer` passes and the container needs to clone and build the repo. It also lacks retry logic for manifest errors and doesn't clean up the Fly credentials from the container environment.\n\nThere's also no HTTP readiness polling after the machine starts. But I'm noticing something: the PROMPT env var is being set, which makes me wonder if the container is designed to build from a prompt alone without needing repo info. Yet `startRemoteContainer` always requires repo parameters, and looking at how `buildContainerEnv` constructs the environment...\n\nBuilding container environment...\n\n...it always sets REPO_URL, CLONE_BRANCH, and PUSH_BRANCH. The background spawn function doesn't set any of these, which is likely the core issue — the container is missing the repo configuration it needs to know where to clone from and push to. The container might have two different modes: one that clones from a repo and builds (what the library uses), and another that starts from just a prompt (what the webhook uses), but the webhook version is missing critical environment variables.\n\nActually, let me reconsider what \"fails to create a container\" really means. It could be that the endpoint itself isn't responding, or the container creation request is being rejected, or the container starts but can't work with the prompt. Looking at the spawn call, I'm seeing it's making a fetch request to the background function with the webhook secret and body parameters...\n\nConstructing the fetch request...\n\nThe issue is that this fetch is fire-and-forget—it's not awaited. In Netlify's v2 function runtime, once the Response is returned, the function context terminates, which means the fetch promise might never resolve before the runtime freezes. The background function could fail to trigger entirely because the spawning function returns before the HTTP request completes.\n\nI'm second-guessing myself though. The fetch does initiate the HTTP request to the network, so even if the promise doesn't resolve, the request itself should be sent—assuming DNS resolution and TCP connection happen quickly enough before the runtime shuts down. But that's still unreliable. The proper solution would be to await the fetch since the background function returns a 202 immediately anyway.\n\nWait, there might be a simpler issue here. Let me check the fetch URL...\n\nWhen this runs in production on Netlify, `siteUrl` would be something like `https://loop-builder.netlify.app`, so it's making an HTTP request back to its own infrastructure at `https://loop-builder.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/spawn-container-background`. \n\nFor Netlify Background Functions with the `-background` suffix, the platform returns 202 Accepted right away and runs the function asynchronously in the background.

Let me look at this from a different angle. Let me re-read the spawn-container.ts more carefully, focusing on potential bugs:\n\n1. The fire-and-forget fetch might not work in serverless - potential issue\n2. The background function uses v1 handler with `event.httpMethod`, `event.headers`, `event.body` - this should work when called via HTTP\n3. The background function requires `containerName, prompt, imageRef, flyApp, flyToken` in the body - spawn-container sends all of these\n\nWait, actually, I think there's a subtle issue. Let me look at the body parsing in `spawn-container-background.ts`:```typescript\n\n\nParsing request body...\n```\n\nAnd the sender is stringifying the same fields. The problem is that `flyToken` comes from `process.env.FLY_API_TOKEN` and `flyApp` comes from `process.env.FLY_APP_NAME`. If either is undefined, JSON.stringify will silently drop those keys, but the background function expects them to be present in the parsed body.\n\nWait, actually the function already validates these environment variables upfront and returns a 500 error if they're missing, so that's not the issue. Let me trace through what actually happens when someone curls the endpoint with a request body.\n\nThe flow should be: authentication passes, environment variables are confirmed, the prompt gets extracted from the request body, a pending database record is created, then a background fetch is triggered to actually spin up the container. The endpoint returns success immediately with a pending status, but I'm suspecting the background function never actually executes, which is why the container never gets created even though the user sees a success response.\n\nBut let me reconsider whether the entire endpoint is failing rather than just the background processing silently failing.\n\nLooking at the bug description again—\"fails to create a container with the supplied or default prompt\"—this could mean the endpoint itself is erroring out, not just the async part. If that's the case, one of the early validation steps must be breaking: the HTTP method check, the webhook secret validation, the Fly credentials, or the database insert. The mention of \"with the supplied or default prompt\" suggests the prompt handling isn't the issue, so I'm leaning toward either missing environment variables or a database connectivity problem.\n\nBut stepping back, I should also consider how Netlify actually handles these functions. The spawn-container function uses the v2 format while spawn-container-background uses v1, and both are valid. The background function should return immediately to the client while Netlify queues the actual work, but if that's not happening correctly, the container creation would appear to fail. I'm realizing the `spawn-container` function is in v2 format, which handles deployment differently than v1 functions like the background function, so there might be a compatibility issue with how the fetch request is being made or how the background function processes it. the response is sent to the client, the Lambda runtime may freeze the execution context before the unawaited fetch promise completes. This means the background function might not actually run if the promise hasn't settled by the time the context freezes. I need to verify whether Netlify Background Functions handle this differently or if I need to explicitly await the fetch call to ensure it executes. the handler returns\n- Unawaited promises may or may not run to completion\n- In subsequent invocations, frozen promises may resume\n\nThis is well-documented as a source of bugs in serverless environments. The standard advice is: **always await your promises**.\n\nSo yes, I'm confident the primary bug is:\n**The `fetch` to trigger the background function is not awaited, so in Netlify's serverless environment, the HTTP request may not be sent before the execution context is frozen.**\n\nThe fix: `await` the fetch call.\n\nBut there's also a secondary consideration. Even if we await the fetch, the background function might still fail for other reasons. Let me also check if `createMachine` and `waitForMachine` are being called correctly.\n\nThe function signatures match the actual calls being made, so those API calls look correct. But I'm noticing that the library's `startRemoteContainer` function has retry logic for `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN` errors that attempts the machine creation multiple times... The fix for the second issue is to add retry logic with exponential backoff matching what the library already does. But I'm second-guessing whether calling a background function via HTTP fetch is even the right pattern here — Netlify recommends having the client invoke background functions directly or using their API. That said, the current approach should work if we await the fetch since the background function returns 202 immediately. Let me also verify the function URL matches the deployed name correctly — the file `netlify/functions/spawn-container-background.ts` deploys as `spawn-container-background`, so that checks out.\n\nI'm noticing a potential format mismatch though: `spawn-container.ts` uses the v2 export syntax while `spawn-container-background.ts` uses v1 with the Handler type. Both should work in Netlify since the format is detected per-function, but this could be worth standardizing. I think I have enough to write up the analysis and implement the fixes.\n\nThe core issue is that the fire-and-forget fetch in `spawn-container.ts` isn't awaited, so in Lambda's execution environment the context freezes before the background function request actually sends. Additionally, `spawn-container-background.ts` is missing the retry logic for transient API errors that the underlying library provides. The fix is to await the fetch call and add retry handling for `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN` errors.\n\nNow I'll document the bug and implement both

Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`).

There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect.

The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n   102→  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n   103→  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n   104→  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n   105→  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n   106→  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n   107→  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n   108→\n   109→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   110→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   111→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   112→\n   113→## Tips\n   114→\n   115→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   116→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   117→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   118→  ```ts\n   119→  build: {\n   120→    sourcemap: true,\n   121→    minify: false,\n   122→  },\n   123→  define: {\n   124→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   125→  },\n   126→  ```\n   127→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   128→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   129→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   130→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   131→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   132→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   133→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   134→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   135→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   136→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   137→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   138→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   139→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   140→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   141→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   142→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   143→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   144→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   145→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   146→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   147→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   148→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   149→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   150→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   151→\n   152→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   153→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   154→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   155→\n   156→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   157→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   158→\n   159→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   160→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   161→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   162→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   163→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   164→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1aad5e47-1d25-4696-a5d0-c9d0b022b78a","uuid":"380b72d4-6cb5-4638-a364-7831959663d0","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":164,"startLine":1,"totalLines":164}}}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites.

There's no test specifically for the spawn-container endpoint. The bug was about the backend endpoint not working, and the fix was purely a code bug (awaiting the fetch, adding retry logic).\n\nSince the test spec doesn't have specific test entries for the spawn-container endpoint behavior (it's a backend function), I need to add at least one test entry that verifies the spawn endpoint works. \n\nLooking at the test spec for StatusPage, the relevant tests are about the UI display of containers and webhook events, not about the actual spawning. \n\nThe skill says: \"If you did not find any relevant tests, add at least one new test entry which checks that the bug doesn't occur.\"\n\n\nI'm realizing that testing the actual Fly.io API call doesn't fit the E2E test pattern here, but I could add a test that verifies the endpoint responds correctly and triggers the background function. The most practical approach would be testing through the StatusPage UI—checking that when a container is spawned via the endpoint, it appears in the containers list. Since the existing tests use mocked routes, I'd need to mock the spawn response appropriately. me think about what test would be appropriate. The StatusPage tests are about displaying containers. A reasonable test would verify that after spawning a container through the endpoint, the StatusPage shows the new container. But since we can't actually call the Fly.io API in tests, this might need to be a mocked test.\n\nActually, I think the most appropriate approach is to add a test entry that covers the spawn-container endpoint's behavior from the UI perspective. Something like: when the webhook documentation shows the spawn endpoint, and you verify the containers table updates. But that's not directly testing the bug fix.\n\nLet me re-read the skill instructions:\n> \"If you did not find any relevant tests, add at least one new test entry which checks that the bug doesn't occur.\"\n\nThe simplest test that would catch this bug would be a test that verifies the spawn-container endpoint responds with a pending container record and that the status page shows it. This can be done with route mocking - we mock the status endpoint to return a container in pending state after the spawn.\n\nActually, the most straightforward approach from a UI perspective is to verify that spawning a container makes it appear in the ActiveContainers table on the StatusPage. I'll add a test entry for this under the StatusPage/ActiveContainers section and write the corresponding test.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":10361,"cache_read_input_tokens":82199,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":10361,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1aad5e47-1d25-4696-a5d0-c9d0b022b78a","uuid":"b55f4364-52ca-4493-b6a7-d69fba29359b"}
