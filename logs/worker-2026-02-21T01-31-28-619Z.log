Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence.

This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n    20→- Before: 6d387c9\n    21→- After: (this commit)\n    22→- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n    23→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n    24→- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n    25→\n    26→2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    27→- Before: e4b5f26\n    28→- After: (this commit)\n    29→- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n    30→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n    31→\n    32→2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    33→- Before: 837fc7f\n    34→- After: 366203c\n    35→- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n    36→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n    37→\n    38→2/20/2026: Directive violations — TLP-NAV-01/02 missing Contacts, PageHeader descriptions missing Import button\n    39→- Before: 2cc96fc\n    40→- After: (this commit)\n    41→- Fix: Fixed TLP-NAV-01 and TLP-NAV-02 test entries in docs/tests.md to include \"Contacts\" in the sidebar navigation links (matching CLP-NAV-01/02 which already had it). Updated PageHeader component descriptions for TasksListPage and DealsListPage to mention the Import button (which existed in code and had test entries but was missing from the Components section). Updated Playwright tests for TLP-NAV-01 (added Contacts visibility check) and TLP-NAV-02 (added Contacts navigation check). All 23 tasks-list-page tests pass.\n    42→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the Contacts nav item and Import buttons were omitted from TLP-NAV-01/02 entries and PageHeader component descriptions when those sections were originally written\n    43→\n    44→2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n    45→- Before: edc5279\n    46→- After: (this commit)\n    47→- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n    48→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n    49→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n    50→\n    51→2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n    52→- Before: 1e5a771\n    53→- After: (this commit)\n    54→- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    55→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n    56→\n    57→2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n    58→- Before: 1e5a771\n    59→- After: (this commit)\n    60→- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    61→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n    62→\n    63→2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n    64→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    65→- After: (this commit)\n    66→- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    67→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    68→\n    69→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    70→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    71→- After: (this commit)\n    72→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    73→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    74→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    75→\n    76→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    77→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    78→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    79→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    80→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    81→\n    82→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    83→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    84→\n    85→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    86→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    87→\n    88→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    89→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    90→\n    91→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    92→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    93→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    94→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    95→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    96→\n    97→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    98→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    99→- Before: df7222c\n   100→- After: c0847d0\n   101→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright.

Contact B does not show the inverse relationship (e.g., \"manages\" Contact A). Relationships between contacts are inherently symmetrical/reciprocal and both sides must be kept in sync.\n\n## Unreviewed\n\n## Finished\n\n2/19/2026: WebhookDialogInstructions — The \"Add Webhook\" dialog needs actual setup instructions for each supported platform.\n- Before: 25bd361\n- After: 7af02ba\n- Fix: Added platform-specific setup guide to the WebhookModal with Zapier, n8n, and Custom Endpoint tabs. Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Webhook Setup Guides section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: e4b5f26\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n\n2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: 837fc7f\n- After: 366203c\n- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n\n2/20/2026: Directive violations — TLP-NAV-01/02 missing Contacts, PageHeader descriptions missing Import button\n- Before: 2cc96fc\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Fixed TLP-NAV-01 and TLP-NAV-02 test entries in docs/tests.md to include \"Contacts\" in the sidebar navigation links (matching CLP-NAV-01/02 which already had it). Updated PageHeader component descriptions for TasksListPage and DealsListPage to mention the Import button (which existed in code and had test entries but was missing from the Components section). Updated Playwright tests for TLP-NAV-01 (added Contacts visibility check) and TLP-NAV-02 (added Contacts navigation check). All 23 tasks-list-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the Contacts nav item and Import buttons were omitted from TLP-NAV-01/02 entries and PageHeader component descriptions when those sections were originally written\n\n2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n- Before: edc5279\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar.

The script handles database creation/sync, Netlify site creation/update,\nand writes the deployed URL to `deployment.txt`.\n\n## Testing\n\nAfter deploying, you MUST perform a functional test to verify the app actually works in production.\nA deployment that serves HTTP 200 is not sufficient — the app must display real data and support updates.\nThe deployment test lives at `tests/deployment.spec.ts`, separate from the integration tests.\nIt must be excluded from regular `npm run test` runs by adding it to `testIgnore` in\n`playwright.config.ts`:\n\n```ts\ntestIgnore: ['**/deployment.spec.ts'],\n```\n\nThe deployment test has its own config at `playwright.deployment.config.ts` which uses\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` to launch the Replay browser and auto-upload recordings.\nAll browsers must run headless — never use Xvfb or set `DISPLAY`.\n\n```\nnpx playwright test --config playwright.deployment.config.ts\n```\n\n### Functional Test Requirements\n\nThe functional test must verify:\n1. **Data displays**: Navigate to the main page and confirm that real data (e.g. client records) loads and renders visibly.\n2. **Data can be updated**: Perform a write operation (e.g. add or edit a record) and confirm the change persists.\n\nIf either check fails, the deployment is broken and must be investigated and fixed before marking the job complete.\n\n### Recording with Replay\n\nAll functional tests MUST be recorded using the Replay Playwright integration so that\nthe Replay browser is used to launch and interact with the deployed page, and failures\ncan be debugged from the recording.\n\nThe deployment test is a SINGLE Playwright test at `tests/deployment.spec.ts` that\nruns against the deployed production URL (read from `deployment.txt`). It uses a\nseparate config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) that launches the Replay browser\nvia `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and auto-uploads recordings. It does not start a dev server\nor reuse the integration test config.\n\n#### Analyzing the Recording\n\nAfter the test runs and the recording is uploaded, use Replay MCP tools to analyze\nthe recording and verify the app works correctly. If the test fails, use the recording\nto diagnose the root cause before attempting a fix.\n\nA deployment is only complete when the Replay recording confirms that the app displays data and\nsupports updates. Record the Replay recording ID in the deployment notes.\n\nRead these skills to learn how to use these:\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-playwright/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\n## Tips\n\n- Do NOT use the `[REDACTED]io record <url>` CLI to create recordings. It launches a headed browser\n  which will crash in this headless container (`Missing X server or $DISPLAY`). Always use the\n  Playwright deployment test config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) which runs headless with\n  `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` and handles browser setup correctly.\n- Do NOT install or start Xvfb. All browsers must run headless. If a browser complains about\n  a missing display, the fix is to ensure it runs headless, not to add a virtual display.\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for verifying the deployment. If the\n  upload is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT decide you have \"enough information\"\n  and proceed without the recording — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis cycle.\n","numLines":87,"startLine":1,"totalLines":87}}}

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence.

Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n    23→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n    24→- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n    25→\n    26→2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    27→- Before: e4b5f26\n    28→- After: (this commit)\n    29→- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n    30→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n    31→\n    32→2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    33→- Before: 837fc7f\n    34→- After: 366203c\n    35→- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n    36→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n    37→\n    38→2/20/2026: Directive violations — TLP-NAV-01/02 missing Contacts, PageHeader descriptions missing Import button\n    39→- Before: 2cc96fc\n    40→- After: (this commit)\n    41→- Fix: Fixed TLP-NAV-01 and TLP-NAV-02 test entries in docs/tests.md to include \"Contacts\" in the sidebar navigation links (matching CLP-NAV-01/02 which already had it). Updated PageHeader component descriptions for TasksListPage and DealsListPage to mention the Import button (which existed in code and had test entries but was missing from the Components section). Updated Playwright tests for TLP-NAV-01 (added Contacts visibility check) and TLP-NAV-02 (added Contacts navigation check). All 23 tasks-list-page tests pass.\n    42→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the Contacts nav item and Import buttons were omitted from TLP-NAV-01/02 entries and PageHeader component descriptions when those sections were originally written\n    43→\n    44→2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n    45→- Before: edc5279\n    46→- After: (this commit)\n    47→- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n    48→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n    49→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n    50→\n    51→2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n    52→- Before: 1e5a771\n    53→- After: (this commit)\n    54→- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    55→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n    56→\n    57→2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n    58→- Before: 1e5a771\n    59→- After: (this commit)\n    60→- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    61→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n    62→\n    63→2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n    64→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    65→- After: (this commit)\n    66→- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    67→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    68→\n    69→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    70→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    71→- After: (this commit)\n    72→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    73→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    74→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    75→\n    76→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    77→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    78→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    79→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    80→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    81→\n    82→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    83→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    84→\n    85→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    86→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    87→\n    88→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    89→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    90→\n    91→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    92→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    93→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    94→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    95→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    96→\n    97→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    98→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    99→- Before: df7222c\n   100→- After: c0847d0\n   101→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n   102→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n   103→\n   104→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n   105→- Before: ef67c9a\n   106→- After: (this commit)\n   107→- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n   108→- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n   109→- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n   110→\n   111→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n   112→- Before: 4e63501\n   113→- After: (this commit)\n   114→- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n   115→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n   116→\n   117→2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n   118→- Before: fbafcda\n   119→- After: (this commit)\n   120→- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n   121→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n   122→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n   123→\n   124→\n   125→\n   126→2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n   127→- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n   128→- Before: fc47dd2\n   129→- After: 8b82e35\n   130→- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n   131→- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n   132→\n   133→2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n   134→- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n   135→- Before: 78daa0a\n   136→- After: fc47dd2\n   137→- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n   138→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n   139→- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n   140→\n   141→2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n   142→- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n   143→- Before: 78daa0a\n   144→- After: fc47dd2\n   145→- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n   146→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n   147→- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n   148→\n   149→2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n   150→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n   151→- Before: 78daa0a\n   152→- After: fc47dd2\n   153→- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar.

Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n   162→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n   163→- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n   164→\n   165→2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n   166→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n   167→- Before: 0301f38\n   168→- After: 0cd095c\n   169→- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile a comprehensive report on SalesCRM's relationship management system.\n\n## Comprehensive Report: SalesCRM Individual Relationships Architecture\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the SalesCRM codebase, here's what I found about how contact/individual relationships work:\n\n---\n\n### 1. DATABASE SCHEMA FOR RELATIONSHIPS\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/schema.ts` (lines 60-68)\n\nThe core relationship table is `individual_relationships`:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS individual_relationships (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  individual_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES individuals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  related_individual_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES individuals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  relationship_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (relationship_type IN ('colleague', 'decision_maker', 'influencer', 'manager', 'report', 'other')),\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),\n  UNIQUE(individual_id, related_individual_id)\n)\n```\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- Unidirectional relationship (A → B only, not automatically B → A)\n- Each relationship has a typed direction via `relationship_type`\n- The 6 supported relationship types are: `colleague`, `decision_maker`, `influencer`, `manager`, `report`, `other`\n- Has a UNIQUE constraint preventing duplicate relationships between the same two individuals\n\n**Related tables:**\n- `individuals` - stores individual contact info (id, name, title, email, phone, location, created_at, updated_at)\n- `client_individuals` - bridges individuals to clients with role and industry fields\n\n---\n\n### 2. BACKEND API ENDPOINTS FOR RELATIONSHIPS\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/individuals.ts`\n\nAll relationship endpoints are nested under individual resources:\n\n#### **GET /individuals/:id** (Lines 173-221)\n- Fetches complete individual with relationships\n- Returns relationships array populated via JOIN query (lines 194-206)\n- Also returns associated clients and contact history\n\nQuery structure:\n```sql\nSELECT ir.id, ir.related_individual_id, i.name AS related_individual_name,\n       ir.relationship_type, ci.role, ci.industry AS company\nFROM individual_relationships ir\nJOIN individuals i ON ir.related_individual_id = i.id\nLEFT JOIN client_individuals ci ON ci.individual_id = ir.related_individual_id\nWHERE ir.individual_id = ${individualId}\nORDER BY i.name ASC\n```\n\n#### **POST /individuals/:id/relationships** (Lines 252-266)\n- Creates a new relationship\n- Request body: `{ related_individual_id: string; relationship_type: string }`\n- Returns the created relationship record with 201 status\n\n#### **DELETE /individuals/:id/relationships/:relId** (Lines 268-272)\n- Deletes a specific relationship by ID\n- Endpoint structure: `/.netlify/functions/individuals/{individualId}/relationships/{relationshipId}`\n\n---\n\n### 3. FRONTEND COMPONENTS FOR RELATIONSHIPS\n\n#### **RelationshipsSection Component**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/RelationshipsSection.tsx`\n\nFeatures:\n- Dual-view system (List View and Graph View)\n- List view displays relationships in rows with:\n  - Related person name (clickable link)\n  - Relationship type label (colleague, decision_maker, influencer, manager, report, other)\n  - Role and company info (if available)\n  - Delete button\n- Graph view displays center node \"You\" with surrounding related individuals arranged in circle\n- Filter dropdown to filter by relationship type\n- Add Entry button to open modal\n- Line drawing (SVG) connecting center to each relationship node in graph view\n\n#### **AddRelationshipModal Component**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/person-detail/AddRelationshipModal.tsx`\n\nFeatures:\n- Person search field with dropdown autocomplete (API search via `/.netlify/functions/individuals?search=`)\n- \"Create New Person\" option to create individuals on-the-fly\n- Relationship Type selector (FilterSelect dropdown with 6 types)\n- Can create a new individual or select existing one\n- Debounced search (200ms)\n- Click-outside-to-close behavior\n\n---\n\n### 4. PERSON DETAIL PAGE IMPLEMENTATION\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/PersonDetailPage.tsx`\n\nThe PersonDetailPage orchestrates relationship management:\n\n**Handler functions:**\n- `handleAddRelationship()` (lines 46-57) - POST to `/.netlify/functions/individuals/${individualId}/relationships`\n- `handleDeleteRelationship()` (lines 85-93) - DELETE to `/.netlify/functions/individuals/${individualId}/relationships/${relationshipId}`\n- `handleUpdatePerson()` (lines 34-44) - PUT to update individual info\n\n**Layout structure:**\n- PersonHeader with editable fields\n- Two-column layout:\n  - Left: RelationshipsSection and ContactHistorySection\n  - Right: AssociatedClientsSection\n- Modals for adding relationships and contact history\n\n**Data flow:**\n1. Component loads with `fetchIndividual(individualId)` from Redux\n2. User clicks \"Add Entry\" → opens AddRelationshipModal\n3. User selects person and relationship type → calls `handleAddRelationship()`\n4. API creates relationship → component reloads data via `loadData()`\n5. RelationshipsSection re-renders with new relationship\n\n---\n\n### 5. TYPE DEFINITIONS\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts` (lines 71-100)\n\n```typescript\nexport type RelationshipType = 'colleague' | 'decision_maker' | 'influencer' | 'manager' | 'report' | 'other'\n\nexport interface Individual {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  title: string | null\n  email: string | null\n  phone: string | null\n  location: string | null\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n  client_associations: ClientAssociation[]\n  relationships: Relationship[]\n  contact_history: ContactHistoryEntry[]\n}\n\nexport interface Relationship {\n  id: string\n  related_individual_id: string\n  related_individual_name: string\n  relationship_type: RelationshipType\n  role: string | null\n  company: string | null\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. DATA SEEDING\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/seed-db.ts` (lines 124-130)\n\nTest data includes 3 sample relationships:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO individual_relationships (individual_id, related_individual_id, relationship_type) VALUES\n(person1.id, person2.id, 'colleague'),\n(person3.id, person4.id, 'colleague'),\n(person1.id, person5.id, 'decision_maker')\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. KNOWN ISSUE: RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIPS\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md` (lines 5-6)\n\n**Open Bug (2/21/2026):**\n> \"Adding a relationship to a contact does not update the other contact to show the reciprocal relationship.\"\n\n**Problem:**\n- When you create relationship A → B (\"reports to\"), only A shows the relationship\n- B does not automatically show the inverse relationship (\"manages\" A)\n- Relationships are currently unidirectional in the database\n- The system needs to be updated to maintain symmetric/reciprocal relationships\n\n**Impact:**\n- Relationships between individuals should be bidirectional but currently are not\n- This is a known limitation of the current implementation\n\n---\n\n### 8. TEST COVERAGE\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/person-detail-page.spec.ts` (lines 171-476)\n\nComprehensive test suite covering:\n- **PDP-REL-01:** Relationships section displays with view toggle\n- **PDP-REL-02:** List View shows relationship entries\n- **PDP-REL-03:** Clicking Link navigates to related person\n- **PDP-REL-04:** Add Entry button opens creation form\n- **PDP-REL-04a:** Create new person from relationship modal\n- **PDP-REL-05:** Adding relationship persists and shows in list\n- **PDP-REL-06:** Filter button filters by relationship type\n- **PDP-REL-07:** Graph View displays visual relationship graph\n- **PDP-REL-08:** Delete button removes relationship\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nThe SalesCRM relationship system is well-architected with:\n- ✓ Clean database schema with typed relationships\n- ✓ RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations\n- ✓ Dual-view UI (list and graph visualization)\n- ✓ Inline creation of new related individuals\n- ✓ Type-safe TypeScript types\n- ✓ Comprehensive Playwright test coverage\n\n**Limitation:**\n- ✗ **Unidirectional relationships** - Currently one-way only; reciprocal relationships not automatically created/maintained (documented as open bug)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a16f0f6 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 66882\ntool_uses: 16\nduration_ms: 33887</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5b3fb5ce-80a9-4a05-9bc7-025fe1f5c418","uuid":"8f36a75a-6059-4e4d-b019-ca3d1ec8ccd9","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the SalesCRM app to understand how contact/individual relationships work.

PERSON DETAIL PAGE IMPLEMENTATION\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/PersonDetailPage.tsx`\n\nThe PersonDetailPage orchestrates relationship management:\n\n**Handler functions:**\n- `handleAddRelationship()` (lines 46-57) - POST to `/.netlify/functions/individuals/${individualId}/relationships`\n- `handleDeleteRelationship()` (lines 85-93) - DELETE to `/.netlify/functions/individuals/${individualId}/relationships/${relationshipId}`\n- `handleUpdatePerson()` (lines 34-44) - PUT to update individual info\n\n**Layout structure:**\n- PersonHeader with editable fields\n- Two-column layout:\n  - Left: RelationshipsSection and ContactHistorySection\n  - Right: AssociatedClientsSection\n- Modals for adding relationships and contact history\n\n**Data flow:**\n1. Component loads with `fetchIndividual(individualId)` from Redux\n2. User clicks \"Add Entry\" → opens AddRelationshipModal\n3. User selects person and relationship type → calls `handleAddRelationship()`\n4. API creates relationship → component reloads data via `loadData()`\n5. RelationshipsSection re-renders with new relationship\n\n---\n\n### 5. TYPE DEFINITIONS\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts` (lines 71-100)\n\n```typescript\nexport type RelationshipType = 'colleague' | 'decision_maker' | 'influencer' | 'manager' | 'report' | 'other'\n\nexport interface Individual {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  title: string | null\n  email: string | null\n  phone: string | null\n  location: string | null\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n  client_associations: ClientAssociation[]\n  relationships: Relationship[]\n  contact_history: ContactHistoryEntry[]\n}\n\nexport interface Relationship {\n  id: string\n  related_individual_id: string\n  related_individual_name: string\n  relationship_type: RelationshipType\n  role: string | null\n  company: string | null\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. DATA SEEDING\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/seed-db.ts` (lines 124-130)\n\nTest data includes 3 sample relationships:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO individual_relationships (individual_id, related_individual_id, relationship_type) VALUES\n(person1.id, person2.id, 'colleague'),\n(person3.id, person4.id, 'colleague'),\n(person1.id, person5.id, 'decision_maker')\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. KNOWN ISSUE: RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIPS\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md` (lines 5-6)\n\n**Open Bug (2/21/2026):**\n> \"Adding a relationship to a contact does not update the other contact to show the reciprocal relationship.\"\n\n**Problem:**\n- When you create relationship A → B (\"reports to\"), only A shows the relationship\n- B does not automatically show the inverse relationship (\"manages\" A)\n- Relationships are currently unidirectional in the database\n- The system needs to be updated to maintain symmetric/reciprocal relationships\n\n**Impact:**\n- Relationships between individuals should be bidirectional but currently are not\n- This is a known limitation of the current implementation\n\n---\n\n### 8. TEST COVERAGE\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/person-detail-page.spec.ts` (lines 171-476)\n\nComprehensive test suite covering:\n- **PDP-REL-01:** Relationships section displays with view toggle\n- **PDP-REL-02:** List View shows relationship entries\n- **PDP-REL-03:** Clicking Link navigates to related person\n- **PDP-REL-04:** Add Entry button opens creation form\n- **PDP-REL-04a:** Create new person from relationship modal\n- **PDP-REL-05:** Adding relationship persists and shows in list\n- **PDP-REL-06:** Filter button filters by relationship type\n- **PDP-REL-07:** Graph View displays visual relationship graph\n- **PDP-REL-08:** Delete button removes relationship\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nThe SalesCRM relationship system is well-architected with:\n- ✓ Clean database schema with typed relationships\n- ✓ RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations\n- ✓ Dual-view UI (list and graph visualization)\n- ✓ Inline creation of new related individuals\n- ✓ Type-safe TypeScript types\n- ✓ Comprehensive Playwright test coverage\n\n**Limitation:**\n- ✗ **Unidirectional relationships** - Currently one-way only; reciprocal relationships not automatically created/maintained (documented as open bug)"}],"totalDurationMs":33887,"totalTokens":66882,"totalToolUseCount":16,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6278,"cache_read_input_tokens":58386,"output_tokens":2215,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6278},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

[2026-02-21T01:25:23.034Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_0148czKcp4wZpz117DLJKXcZ","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I understand the bug clearly. The issues are:\n\n1. **POST /individuals/:id/relationships** (line 253-266): When adding a relationship, only one row is inserted. We need to also insert the reciprocal relationship. The relationship types have natural inverses:\n   - `manager` ↔ `report`\n   - `colleague` ↔ `colleague`\n   - `decision_maker` ↔ `decision_maker` (or maybe just the same?)\n   - `influencer` ↔ `influencer`\n   - `other` ↔ `other`\n\n2. **GET /individuals/:id** (line 194-206): The relationships query only looks at `WHERE ir.individual_id = ${individualId}`. It needs to also include relationships where this individual is the `related_individual_id` (i.e., the reverse direction).\n   \n3. **DELETE /individuals/:id/relationships/:relId** (line 269-271): When deleting a relationship, we need to also delete the reciprocal one.\n\nI'm weighing two approaches: either insert reciprocal rows whenever a relationship is created so the database maintains symmetric pairs, or query both directions when fetching relationships. The first approach seems cleaner since it keeps the data consistent at the source.\n\nBut actually, querying both directions is better—it avoids duplicate data, works with existing records without migration, and is simpler to maintain. I need to figure out how to handle the inverse relationship types when querying in both directions, since some relationships like manager/report are directional while others like colleague are symmetric. The DELETE endpoint has the same issue—if the relationship was created from A's side but we're deleting from B's side, the row's individual_id won't match, so the delete fails. Approach B requires updating both GET and DELETE to handle querying and deleting from either direction, while Approach A would need to insert reciprocal rows for both directions and handle the UNIQUE constraint, plus deal with existing data that lacks reciprocals. I'm going with Approach B since it's cleaner and works with existing data. Now I need to map out the inverse relationship types.\n\nWriting the updated query... Completing the query with the inverse relationship lookup, then I need to write a DELETE statement that removes relationships where the individual appears on either side of the connection. Now I should check the test suite to see what needs updating.","signature":"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

Let me implement the fix. The approach is to modify the GET query to include reverse relationships (where this individual is the `related_individual_id`), and to modify the DELETE to handle both directions.\n\nThe fix involves:\n\n1. **Backend GET `/individuals/:id`**: Change the relationships query to also include reverse relationships. Use UNION ALL with inverted relationship types for reverse rows.\n\n2. **Backend DELETE `/individuals/:id/relationships/:relId`**: Allow deleting where the individual is on either side.\n\n3. **Backend POST `/individuals/:id/relationships`**: No change needed - we query both directions, so a single row captures both sides.\n \nI need to map the inverse relationship types correctly, where `manager` pairs with `report`, while `colleague`, `decision_maker`, `influencer`, and `other` are symmetric. Rather than trying to write a UNION ALL directly in the neon template literal, I'll execute two separate queries and merge the results in JavaScript. Writing the SQL query... Writing the DELETE query...\n\nNow I'm ready to implement this

Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Webhook Setup Guides section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: e4b5f26\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n\n2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: 837fc7f\n- After: 366203c\n- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n\n2/20/2026: Directive violations — TLP-NAV-01/02 missing Contacts, PageHeader descriptions missing Import button\n- Before: 2cc96fc\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Fixed TLP-NAV-01 and TLP-NAV-02 test entries in docs/tests.md to include \"Contacts\" in the sidebar navigation links (matching CLP-NAV-01/02 which already had it). Updated PageHeader component descriptions for TasksListPage and DealsListPage to mention the Import button (which existed in code and had test entries but was missing from the Components section). Updated Playwright tests for TLP-NAV-01 (added Contacts visibility check) and TLP-NAV-02 (added Contacts navigation check). All 23 tasks-list-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the Contacts nav item and Import buttons were omitted from TLP-NAV-01/02 entries and PageHeader component descriptions when those sections were originally written\n\n2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n- Before: edc5279\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n- Before: 0cd095c\n- After: 78daa0a\n- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior. Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n\n2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n- Before: 0301f38\n- After: 0cd095c\n- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":2,"oldLines":11,"newStart":2,"newLines":16,"lines":[" "," ## Open"," ","-2/21/2026: Adding a relationship to a contact does not update the other contact to show the reciprocal relationship.","-- When you add a relationship between two contacts (e.g., Contact A \"reports to\" Contact B), only Contact A shows the relationship.
