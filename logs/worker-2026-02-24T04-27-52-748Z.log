This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide.

Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   214→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   215→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   216→\n   217→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   218→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   219→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   220→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→\n   222→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   223→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   224→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   225→\n   226→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   227→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   228→\n   229→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   230→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   231→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   232→\n   233→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   234→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   235→\n   236→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   237→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   238→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   239→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   240→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   241→\n   242→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   243→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   244→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   245→\n   246→## Tips\n   247→\n   248→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   249→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   250→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   251→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   252→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   253→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   254→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   255→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   256→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   257→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   258→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   259→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   260→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   261→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   262→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   263→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   264→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   265→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   266→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   267→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   268→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   269→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   270→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   271→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   272→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   273→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   274→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   275→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   276→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   277→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   278→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   279→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   280→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   281→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   282→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   283→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   284→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   285→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   286→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   287→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   288→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   289→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01Wybw2PZpzQLXWCVVCPUXvC","session_id":"b59a0829-b962-43ed-b7c5-eedbf2d7d955","uuid":"88cf9595-b177-4742-8634-1b78b4500edb"}

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01L1vDwR8WhhZW5wQzYtK5D8","session_id":"b59a0829-b962-43ed-b7c5-eedbf2d7d955","uuid":"3a1c88c7-67b8-430b-b889-dc876adb5897"}

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent.

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    80→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    81→\n    82→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    83→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    84→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    85→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n    86→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n    87→\n    88→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    89→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    90→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    91→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    92→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    93→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    94→\n    95→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n    96→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n    97→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n    98→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n    99→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   100→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   101→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   102→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   103→\n   104→## Parallel Test Design\n   105→\n   106→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   107→Write tests with this in mind:\n   108→\n   109→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   110→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   111→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   112→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   113→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   114→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   115→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   116→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   117→  being unmodified.\n   118→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   119→  you need to interact with.\n   120→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   121→\n   122→## Tips\n   123→\n   124→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   125→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   126→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   127→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   128→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   129→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   130→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   131→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   132→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   133→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01L1vDwR8WhhZW5wQzYtK5D8","session_id":"b59a0829-b962-43ed-b7c5-eedbf2d7d955","uuid":"162b8d09-5b93-4915-be26-75594d16128d"}

Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive, and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n  * If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n  * If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n```\n\n## /repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md - Directives Section (lines 25-102)\n\n```markdown\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels, options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default. Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching. A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous — never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test — this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`, `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements. If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account, verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass. These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint, query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n```\n\n## Key Directives Related to Your Focus Areas\n\n**Navigation URL Assertions:**\n- writeTests.md line 27: \"Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists.\"\n\n**Field Assertions in Forms (Pre-population/Verification):**\n- writeTests.md lines 82-86: When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field, the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and assertions.

The test has access to client data (acmeClient) through the beforeAll, but the View Details test doesn't get the client ID. Need to capture the Acme Corp client ID and assert the URL includes it.\n\n2. **tasks-list.spec.ts line 456** - \"Clicking card\" test: `await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/clients\\//)` should verify the specific Globex Solutions client URL. \n\nThe core issue is that the client IDs are created in `beforeAll` but aren't accessible within the individual tests due to scope limitations. I need to extract and store these IDs so I can construct the exact URLs expected in each navigation assertion.\n\nFor the second issue, I'm looking at the \"New Task can be created successfully\" test where after task creation, I need to verify that the due date and assignee fields are properly displayed on the task card, not just that the task exists.\n\nIn the \"Edit\" dialog test, the spec expects the form to be pre-populated with all task details including due date, priority, assignee, client, and deal, but the current test only validates that the task name field is filled in.\n\nNow I'm checking what data the ListTest-Medium-Task was created with to understand what assertions I should add...\n\nLooking at the test data, the task has a due date set to tomorrow, priority of Medium, assignee David Lee, and client Globex Solutions, but no deal assigned. So I need to add assertions that verify each of these fields displays the correct value in the edit dialog—checking that the priority trigger shows \"Medium\", the assignee shows \"David Lee\", the client shows \"Globex Solutions\", and the due date contains tomorrow's date.\n\nFor the task card created in the header spec, I should verify the due date displays as \"Tomorrow\" and the assignee is visible. Then I'll implement the fixes by storing the client objects at the describe scope so I can assert the correct navigation URLs, and add the missing field assertions to both test files.","signature":"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

For assignee, the value is `name::role`, and the label is `abbreviateName(name) (role)`. For client, the value is the `client.id`, label is `client.name`. For deal, value is `deal.id`, label is `deal.name`.\n3. **Due date input**: `datetime-local` type, shows the date formatted via `formatDatetimeLocal`.\n\n\n4. I need to fix the navigation URL assertions in the tests by capturing the actual client IDs for Acme Corp and Globex Solutions, then asserting that the URLs include those specific IDs instead of just matching a generic pattern.\n\n5. I also need to add missing field assertions in two places: verify that the due date and assignee display correctly after creating a task in tasks-header.spec.ts, and check that the edit dialog properly pre-populates all fields (due date, priority, assignee, and client) in tasks-list.spec.ts.\n\nNow I'm setting up the client ID variables and implementing the fixes across both test files.\n\nStoring client IDs...

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   175→   on what you found.\n   176→\n   177→### Bug Writeup Template\n   178→\n   179→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   180→\n   181→```\n   182→# Bug: <test name>\n   183→\n   184→## Step 1: Evidence\n   185→\n   186→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   187→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   188→no evidence.>\n   189→\n   190→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   191→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   192→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   193→\n   194→## Step 2: Determination\n   195→\n   196→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   197→\n   198→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   199→\n   200→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   201→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   202→```\n   203→\n   204→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   205→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   206→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   207→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   208→\n   209→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   210→\n   211→## Directives\n   212→\n   213→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   214→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   215→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   216→\n   217→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   218→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   219→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   220→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→\n   222→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   223→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   224→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   225→\n   226→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   227→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   228→\n   229→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   230→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   231→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   232→\n   233→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   234→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   235→\n   236→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   237→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   238→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   239→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   240→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   241→\n   242→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   243→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   244→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   245→\n   246→## Tips\n   247→\n   248→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   249→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   250→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   251→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   252→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   253→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   254→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   255→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   256→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   257→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   258→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   259→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   260→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   261→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   262→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   263→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   264→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   265→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   266→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   267→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   268→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   269→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   270→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   271→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   272→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches).

Log full metadata for every recording that has test metadata in a delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, log `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n      On failure, log the exit code.\n\n8. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n9. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: Playwright test output, recording metadata block, upload confirmations.\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON. The\n  `addMetadata` entries contain `metadata.test.result` which indicates pass/fail.\n- The Playwright config must use the Replay browser via `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n  from `@replayio/playwright` and include `replayReporter` with `upload: false`.\n- The HTML reporter must use `open: 'never'` to suppress the interactive \"Serving HTML report\"\n  prompt that blocks the script from exiting.\n- Run Playwright with `--retries 0` — no retries. Failures must be analyzed via Replay.\n- Use `child_process.execSync` or `execFileSync` for subprocess calls, inheriting stdio for\n  Playwright output.\n- The `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` env var is already set in the container.\n","numLines":99,"startLine":1,"totalLines":99}}}

[2026-02-24T04:22:07.118Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_012TeyK6dXUB55cEwbCCZjnT","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The assignee trigger shows \"Select assignee...\" instead of \"David L.\" when editing. This means the assignee field isn't pre-populated in the edit dialog. Let me investigate.\n\nLooking at the TaskFormModal, the assignee value is set via `currentAssigneeValue` which is `${assignee}::${assigneeRole}`. The assignee options have value `${a.name}::${a.role || ''}`.\n\nSo when editing the ListTest-Medium-Task which was created with `assignee: 'David Lee'` and `assignee_role: 'Sales'`, the `initial.assignee` should be `'David Lee'` and `initial.assignee_role` should be `'Sales'`, giving `currentAssigneeValue = 'David Lee::Sales'`. The option value for David Lee with Sales role would be `David Lee::Sales`.\n\n\nThe problem could be in how the task data flows to the edit form—either the API isn't returning assignee information or the dialog isn't receiving it properly. Let me check the Replay recording to trace where the assignee data gets lost.\n\nActually, I think I see the issue now. In the TaskFormModal component, the assignee value is constructed as `${assignee}::${assigneeRole}`, and the select options use the same format `${name}::${role}`. If the initial assignee data is being passed correctly, the SearchableSelect should find a matching option by comparing these formatted values.\n\nLet me trace through how the edit dialog receives the initial task data and whether the assignee and assigneeRole fields are populated correctly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2374,"cache_read_input_tokens":62175,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2374,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b59a0829-b962-43ed-b7c5-eedbf2d7d955","uuid":"5e59ff13-9273-416c-85ad-eb1fce5c4261"}

So the data IS there. The issue is how the form resolves the assignee value.\n\nLet me look more carefully at how the assignee select works:\n\n1. The `currentAssigneeValue` is computed as `assignee ? `${assignee}::${assigneeRole}` : ''`\n2. With `assignee = 'David Lee'` and `assigneeRole = 'Sales'`, this would be `'David Lee::Sales'`\n3. The `assigneeOptions` are built from `assignees` in the Redux store\n\n\n4. The option values follow the same pattern: `${a.name}::${a.role || ''}`\n5. The selected option is found by matching the value, so if no match is found, the trigger shows the placeholder instead\n\nThe real question is whether the assignees array in the Redux store actually contains David Lee. Looking at the API response, I can see task data with clients, deals, and assignees, but I need to verify if the assignees list includes this person.\n\nLet me trace through the tasks slice to see how assignees are being loaded and populated.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1067,"cache_read_input_tokens":77774,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1067,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b59a0829-b962-43ed-b7c5-eedbf2d7d955","uuid":"b7c014fd-30e0-4a40-a71e-72c3c5379ec7"}

The assignees query is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT i.name, ci.role\nFROM individuals i\nLEFT JOIN client_individuals ci ON ci.individual_id = i.id\nWHERE i.name IS NOT NULL AND i.name != ''\nORDER BY i.name\n```\n\nThis returns `{ name, role }` objects. The `AssigneeOption` interface has `{ name: string, role: string | null }`.\n\nNow, in the `TaskFormModal`, the `assigneeOptions` are built as:\n```ts\nconst assigneeOptions = assignees.map((a: AssigneeOption) => ({\n\n\n```\n\nBuilding the select options...\n\nThe `currentAssigneeValue` is constructed as `${assignee}::${assigneeRole}`, so for the edit case with `assignee = 'David Lee'` and `assigneeRole = 'Sales'`, it becomes `'David Lee::Sales'`. The options use the same format for their values, so the matching should work correctly.\n\nBut I'm realizing there's a potential mismatch: the task's `assignee` field stores whatever freeform string was passed during creation, while the dropdown options come from the individuals table. So if the test creates a task with `assignee: 'David Lee'` but there's no individual named \"David Lee\" in the seeded data, the dropdown won't have a matching option and the select won't show a value. I need to check what the test's setup actually creates. The real problem is that the test is creating tasks with assignee names that don't necessarily exist in the individuals table, so when the edit form tries to populate the assignee dropdown from actual database records, \"David Lee\" won't be available as an option to pre-select. The assertion needs to account for this mismatch between what the test creates and what the form can actually display. I'm looking at what assignees the API returns—the query pulls individuals and their roles from the database, so \"David Lee\" and \"Sarah Jenkins\" need to actually exist in the seed data for them to show up in the dropdown. Rather than asserting a specific assignee name, I should check whether an assignee value is present at all, which would be more robust.\n\nActually, I'm realizing this might be an app bug where the edit form should pre-populate with existing values even if they're not in the dropdown options. But since my task is to fix the test assertions themselves, not the app code, I should write assertions that verify pre-population happens—and if the test fails because the app doesn't actually do this, that's a legitimate failure that would need a separate fix.\n\nLooking at the actual test error, the assignee field shows \"Select assignee...\" instead of \"David L.\", which means either \"David Lee\" isn't in the available assignees list or there's a format mismatch. Rather than getting bogged down in the seed data, I should take a practical approach: either use an assignee that definitely exists in the dropdown, or remove the assertion if the app genuinely can't

Sarah Jenkins - CEO (Acme Corp), Advisor (Globex Solutions)\n2. Michael Chen - CTO (Globex Solutions)\n3. Jane Doe - Self\n4. Tom Wilson - VP Sales\n5. Emily Davis - Director\n6. Alex Johnson - Manager\n\nThe assignees query:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT i.name, ci.role\nFROM individuals i\nLEFT JOIN client_individuals ci ON ci.individual_id = i.id\nWHERE i.name IS NOT NULL AND i.name != ''ORDER BY i.name\n```\nThis would return:\n\n\n- Alex Johnson, Manager\n- Emily Davis, Director\n- Jane Doe, Self\n- Michael Chen, CTO\n- Sarah Jenkins, CEO\n- Sarah Jenkins, Advisor\n- Tom Wilson, VP Sales\n\nThe test is creating tasks with assignees like \"David Lee\" and assigning Sarah Jenkins the role \"PM\", but neither of these exist in the dropdown options. Since the test data doesn't include these assignee values, the assertions will fail because there's a mismatch between what the test expects and what's actually available.\n\nThe real issue is that the test needs to use assignees that actually exist in the seed data. For the Edit test with the Globex Solutions task, I should switch to using Michael Chen as the assignee since he's already set up as the CTO contact for that client.\n\nBut this creates a ripple effect—other tests are already asserting on the current assignee values, so changing the test data would break those assertions. The assignee display tests at lines 165-181 are passing because they're checking what renders on the task card itself, which is separate from the edit dialog's dropdown validation issue.\n\nThe cleanest solution is to update the test task data to use assignee names that actually exist in the individuals table, then adjust the corresponding assertions. I'd swap the High task to use \"Sarah Jenkins\" as CEO and the Medium task to use \"Michael Chen\" as CTO, which would make both the card display and the edit dropdown consistent. Now I need to verify that the `abbreviateName` function handles these names correctly.\n\nBoth components use the same abbreviation logic, so \"Sarah Jenkins\" becomes \"Sarah J.\" and \"Michael Chen\" becomes \"Michael C.\" when paired with their roles in the dropdown options.\n\nFor the edit task flow, when I load an existing assignment like \"Sarah Jenkins\" with role \"CEO\", it needs to match the dropdown value \"Sarah Jenkins::CEO\" so the form pre-selects correctly. The fix is to update the test data to use actual people instead of placeholder names, then adjust the assertions to verify the assignee display works properly.","signature":"EpokCkYICxgCKkC0NruVSqLhaUH7QcUVt3DImTcKiiWXEsN+wYHHpji32FPWVkKSlPYsbuv23JSPDfgkB8jCdsYI7HYIaoxK18hhEgydndYEb7OwfFDaYwkaDEuhx78+/nVFe3zpiCIwF31Se5D+x1vWat3ugIYx2KWmbHa7ts2K9hLdPI/OuS6PZ1h658mhnhBMolOIG2iVKoEjSzROifXMhu3RtK780matwXS/JWEidYJeq5IIPW0cAH9WeVT5GgmbjNJ4fr3f89vf5eqETYLiO5hslnHTfFCjlHpm8o/t6HVla54H8AFp85hz0W+9b6D0+K+o3sADiUN1kTkNPnEuvnSWQXPhMcjg9nZTQnUVj4kEZl7iLjvDVlqs3RvDkJCbtNvIj+tIQ2/bMgOEQRE7XbEIHKRlSOpbkZoEKO+L/lDZ8lNleMBOXWdlaqBXPOueOOhMI1c2a6VZsLDt41f8ryKj6Y+6P9yFQzN5lUEDztvz+viPin8P++78FkBBXo3HWHGVjN1vI0Z2qLdkVBW/Y32wfPAfqMaNLMZYUwLXTlf//D/D0Lkb+VBNmv/ex1J2/fXLrJrdwo5UDJqOe87mlKe9x+nsMCNlc89X7d9Gy7Z0ppmYYxc6pZoWl/d/ogPRBK3GLZIAUxu7TZCZtZ3gN4MsffeBVtDxO2JRjwJN8150L/6GXOtF2AGzpVxee+ROsZBTLHL0oar8LUoEanPkUn862lAw7K6b1lzkhaGdlGS2I3P6ZpxFn5d7HvnPeW8kSuO19YNCN48+vt/mQBgJQtXNwuFMMS+2W5P6/4IqVOG7OBiTxHX1PL9TpXmvRhRLt54Z0SZ7okpKkJspHxin+eocl172gc1GBJkRx288DJVNCXSkvvTkK4zN1UO4pPJacl0aXnEMvdITrUYu/ObsW9wUxU97zC2N5QFFk04DGRJPDDRD/3yyWfU0rHxTp/FjnzOcEaaysjL/t3FRJ8UKISn9AgNGaJCOrtpLnhqqHSuf02SuFg4dpPecvTNN16gvI7cUh+RUBcc7QshCTQkc+2kiZHNMpFjpASJvFB/llg2th5LbkSnussHzCpEUfXjxWG8Xv4YLToiwcLrqfRNr8ljYg0BYGcbKAxFu+rZAPNCsMhWcEJDp2boeTOBqwdfjdZ6a2SqYqpRNVJxJZ1Qgdj2tgMJ84HbRJc01YOou4hAx+d381x01o1Dqi7QNznSudfOI9BpyhiZdMWO71FXA+kqhhWSsSXmaXVgisvs+IgO7/6Zut9KI5czRWzlvqCXshOd3czQxNE/ZIbxaqVVRR/3ZNREuJyaZMO5w8xeU6CAno5DB9s4FOxR2/mFssgmp0BnnxSQztA1jfs3R0t3q9nYevXXOq1K3u3T691HlpGTD3tGpG0pEIZZB6MTtGRZhnZdkFndCC3LlB2ZJvglTt9BPXHxTL6KmDkRvHRNQo993Glo4xR2P5JALbV0OSxiMNhd4Zc+kByd06uj9puryoKhnCXT+TgNT6zi9PkNDsoBH/6KkegIn3OEN+863qIkbhGmUZPxqk9fVqAbqdSqxrQPO3RVMRcvtDRHiBRgxd/1A+iIHKz5YPU2V6BgChigd2arIq975DYcz2ZoDdHnjR6A7FJTUarupIzhGQdSJIqe4LLp3KUTUxxf0WQh0ylyCuY2b2sr94seuGyyjbmGHtwRE+kwO0C/72MFuife6bp5/6VPteS9Mx1xBDoRCL3VCq3qwzex/rdKsO30ASOhxVNitpjQD81KwfOq51LSVc+igXzlKSfUuG77zXlNyggVnrUIxc/4ZXOIX+00UAo+CSED0bewvi6zRV7OoFhvY8AmXHRXwXpFieV3r/mR1NMEN+WFE7eGO8+UIwjhThOJDXazV5CufouFCpLY2nbdmU71lOBVcEzY7syBtNc/jKfIOdQ2CY8p1xvV/nLBMdD6msOd2ghVdO0zCpofIa21YsRS7NdzXhaA02AwZwd8gLtKOAkySJZ1VC4/dL1bxaOs9hpAvBAU8Kmg2xdCzxq52a+ENzae5NgSkhLuJwgO29m4KNqDVobLQ0gK00hbWK7VsngRuneVKwpv3EmM3pveQqj0OcVanf3Rr+dtPz6g0hD4LVnuI2RbkY96lnF0fDgEgjBZB9t3MuDk5pa3lNhcrAJo+PVBFHQDZ4ZOn+JfgvUykaC2esSj27HSB9k+pYVshnrciROxzGTZLXz5qybJz2BU3JydfbYOc9iBkEz8X1swvL5YiRxs8NZpG0mZHnWsBjoEC2b+9wzejEttcAhPZkcB54Nq0+siJV7Z9Yw/Z8xw+fNZMxHKLl0KjJFv40foYYeMKRcPv1BACPNhgqEIB4teDzI9Z5/lhd4dwFD4F0RLwwPfIjxA8wSvdDLxl7v8VQPLsYdEFYhtP8gJXWFUCq89d033eT+9luuHCF09Y535p4jnFh6ARz8tSPuHMBurIkBVu3aZUitshDSuILnWJGOFTYcYQKjsw3SwduLTN0MGbDkqUY7guN7CHgKO6O2kEPap+R4V62wGlpxJYKYk9brQCfpy1wM8P8DHF4aXNIvQ6DclzIZrnokGbnoDUH7DxmHuutLZQuZLJEABFrvgmwXn5/VYcXE9942DUMezaMog8RIEjnicEMO5Ag8wMyUzG7xXo1RHovKjVAXsYt+IBVPJbelE6GQDboPySKrDJbkOnvYqkG9bFt8BpNXcyVsvxqA6xhS7MMGTgHlqox2VagllIRfKOnV3D6NSIlfSGW4HwbgDq21NfHI9xJuO+gePQA0F3wfEZ+wd+TyEKyPbANOwHIQ9YOjMPWzzsIxHm58rJmmywqv0VLBXahQHjptIjCEkbFlGmASYZE70Fefnij62ymTQSs97pLHiR9Umu7gKTzIHtCWICUBIhAP0j30iyBUaTuFEQC9r603Treka4yfLs7Lqn9P0WnZV3x5ck93v3fddqWySOnS1k8Anih6q0w28z/z5LDxVFFoHF+Icf/c2JWjf380y6vobbO3ECHsiZevW//xCcbkyrTMn2w4bvOFhryiO2GYnvK3fWaofEDo7gFBPZG44JDbl83UAMboZhmUqYjoPuedSApxPgcWg5sqc4Xb110WG45tkQoRCsmcFVX0eXex8tTmEyOt5Ijay8MSPMHXjMZ1H8475R4Jriugz6Tgv3Su/OmqNnHGeY2DBnULkxA5rMVz01R30DXjWR9WjBzPuLWbd5obOe1b0Ltc2WkfMLlsbHXMMt+LIj08Jos8Lk628pqCi8ryztwky3I2NL3MT4zeEBc7nxaCbMPvboiaBtTzYU110J0Ofk+1o+z5atY96eUSfL+GhdBo+JgY695Nx8y3WXDQ8s573SHf7+q/nE+0AvPr3UmNrVIuBUujGS9PQaPCanbg1cKlMd5LXIb6oVwx/Q1Kh7W3SazX09EhBxgSyRJMXW5ZtmzIBIRihdIyeUdgIQGPM4XzMLD5HcthB/wca2xb4H9cGBPSXFl7+If19nJItb95XDOYJJr14l8o/M3Ixc1U6j2FQ9pBwtg4XYmZmpWTyGZibRgTbo2fLosXVi/HqAiScUZJdky6NTJH6/CIj0B/63rBbu6yw1/mGP09xdGul1xgQbVboQgO6PV1xOyhxKYV+TaKIV7I/fHDsGs//dyKUw1lej1pu/Z8Daqy+xjkbRqiHjfDa0P8tK+SgkiGxYWZOa468r7o592H1hbFcpgFwWtGVb3R1//c0tgHNJHEKUaZUo7+YBvp/Vth3dWnWyEIwOt9FSiIFD1NzSaFRa9C531PVFwX0swuiExuiwrT6SXXea8tMY+Fzn0/bqU3f9fnm2Txw2xUy10JvwNjCN8MsVhUHs7DwWThfL7vYAZxec2NpA2S+Un8J/klityJKvstUelxNi13zPnrFnGxzQ81Xqx5jKBpzk7Z6Z7yO+OoahMfLrHsn7Plurbh17XyhQzZxNZdNI1wRSEX6zorF8w2MR9XnnleBHwTI3Z+VOVABhTsy20PWeiwI/gdHFLGiLETX6FfvoeiEk4LCw/NJnhrFl6x/tS/iD291dSi4BGKWGHXT21yvolDGVHUgLhnGNyvqRDWM+ocaxzQk7efRWBW790PrQesNHi/5TXgxaAnABPSE86retWDuRb2kAn2w3q3+f9/1wp9NT2jGLGTtzJanrZVoba9E5WTyuCPXeN4c2qifEWNoO6o9GOIK/GXqvMYjSajUnVLrZJGKxWgZ8WOFL0xY7oMuaGpGosC8+CFmIldwAW+BzemHwlI/jzIrdHetlT1CZx39Y9OCRE3fX2lxIl964UBWUHLSK5KRcxqi4WZ+vNYjI3WNmCSBkhy13XwAuLVYF8GZzOEf57xQPvcXew2ez4RlyjgGLRwXBxirulR6bHeXkCApmSKJ65AKgGDZaSHP/Xj/Y8UtkGysAkYap2E0KYccc8tCryN853qnQ+6QDXm6j+cQ47JalGB246xjhvypKt1DzbSD/8LBWFK8/ahEE2k+IAWSTCC+bhuT2f6kdwM1hHKhlpL7nesnLAu2Zj1oGRuLmKLaYXyQnAkNd0TCBBpsum78lbaNgHTsyIr2NS0Ll0MqEl9Se+lTWr4kKVdNMKZ3UQwvHLwqB6YPwuWWFJjeinq0/nh9ZFoB3pce/KybOajzX3eF/teNv2Hg6Fuk8JDTdpTIIB9xxjdZyvg5beq78wYNbh9tUGCf6gx84MF5bKwob63j5vn4OJ/kIvd5crGaylwx+wne/7tIzksa1UnccXPaCsRGAugfUlj2OjkP7ryA47hXnPhepO6SaC/Zo714fXOxvuHSflOGEWc9ad6ACmQIipXy0OJhpOEVCfks64xR0ozqs5/uNEumIMPD5VeJIvosXOtpPQOVZVlGR/6RpP1p4y0zAX3v6e8gJx2Ai3fqt6LSLFT6pbjr4tikWArEbUKb2VGmBK3sMmI/3EuVnTiMhr201UnRs5M1mm4Bnzt2p4SOQnRPvjSSvp3zG
