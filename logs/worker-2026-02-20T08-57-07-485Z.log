This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    80→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    81→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01XdTe21iYr3UU22Afd6DkdD","session_id":"90b75d5d-9ef8-4be5-84c4-8d3de19ba1a1","uuid":"5fed73cb-4f03-419f-9a7d-bf89f3f07c18"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01XdTe21iYr3UU22Afd6DkdD","session_id":"90b75d5d-9ef8-4be5-84c4-8d3de19ba1a1","uuid":"c64b0c32-e0fa-4438-97e1-ff1cbac07f74"}

This catches issues like email\n    84→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    85→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    86→\n    87→## Parallel Test Design\n    88→\n    89→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n    90→Write tests with this in mind:\n    91→\n    92→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n    93→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n    94→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n    95→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n    96→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n    97→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n    98→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n    99→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   100→  being unmodified.\n   101→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   102→  you need to interact with.\n   103→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   108→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   109→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   110→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   111→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   112→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   113→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   114→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   115→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   116→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01XdTe21iYr3UU22Afd6DkdD","session_id":"90b75d5d-9ef8-4be5-84c4-8d3de19ba1a1","uuid":"ef8ece3b-0ef7-4a50-ab3b-e418fc55329b"}

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":116,"startLine":1,"totalLines":116}}}

Let me first re-read the test entries and the directives carefully.\n\n## testSpec.md Directives:\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. \n\n4. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives.\n\n5. For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\n\n6. For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n7. Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n8. Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they function properly.\n\n9. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n10. Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type).\n\n11. Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n\n12. State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example: If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the TaskDetailPage test entries and starting with the TaskDetailHeader section, which should verify that the task detail page displays task information including title, priority badge, status, due date, assignee, and other relevant fields.\n\nFor the header interactions, I need to test that marking a task complete triggers a confirmation dialog and updates the status appropriately, that canceling a task deletes it and redirects back to the tasks list, and that the back button navigates correctly.\n\nThe TaskNotesSection tests should verify the empty state message, that adding a note persists it with content, author, and timestamp while clearing the input, and that deleting a note removes it from the list. I'm noticing gaps in the test coverage—the client and deal links are clickable elements but there's no verification they navigate correctly. TDP-HDR-02 tests marking a task complete but doesn't confirm the change persists after a page reload or that it creates a timeline entry.

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecTaskDetailPage - Checking testSpec.md directives against TaskDetailPage test entries\n\nI'll systematically check each testSpec.md directive against the TaskDetailPage test entries (TDP-HDR-01 through TDP-HDR-04, TDP-NTS-01 through TDP-NTS-03).\n\n**Checking test entries against testSpec.md directives:**\n\n**Directive: \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\"**\n- Components section lists: Back button, task title with priority badge, description, due date, assignee, client/deal links, status badge, Mark Complete and Cancel Task buttons\n- TDP-HDR-01 mentions: title, priority badge, status, due date, assignee, client/deal names\n- **Issue**: TDP-HDR-01 does NOT mention verifying the **description** field, which is listed in the components section and rendered in TaskDetailHeader.tsx (line 32-36). The test entry should verify description is shown when present.\n\n**Directive: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result\"**\n- The components section says \"client/deal links\" — but looking at the actual code (TaskDetailHeader.tsx lines 49-54), client and deal names are displayed as plain `<span>` elements, NOT as links. So no violation here from the test spec side — they're not clickable elements.\n- Back button: TDP-HDR-04 specifies \"/tasks list page\" — OK.\n- Mark Complete: TDP-HDR-02 specifies result — OK.\n- Cancel Task: TDP-HDR-03 specifies \"/tasks list page\" — OK.\n- Add note button: TDP-NTS-02 specifies result — OK.\n- Delete note button: TDP-NTS-03 specifies result — OK.\n\n**Directive: \"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying change is persisted correctly and exactly the right side effects occur\"**\n- TDP-HDR-02 (Mark Complete): Checks status change and button visibility, but does NOT verify **persistence** (reload and re-check). Also doesn't verify any timeline/history side effect (though it's not clear if the app tracks task completions in a timeline).\n- TDP-NTS-02 (Adding a note): Says \"persists and shows in list\" but the entry itself doesn't explicitly require a reload-and-verify step.\n- TDP-NTS-03 (Deleting a note): Says \"removed from the list\" but doesn't verify persistence.\n\n**Directive: \"Button and control appearance matters\"**\n- TDP-HDR-01 doesn't specify the exact text/icon of the back button (ArrowLeft icon) or the exact text of Mark Complete/Cancel Task buttons. However, TDP-HDR-02 and TDP-HDR-03 do reference them by name.\n\n**Directive: \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\"**\n- TDP-HDR-02 and TDP-HDR-03 mention \"confirm in dialog\" but there's no test entry for dismissing/canceling the confirmation dialog. The ConfirmDialog has a cancel action (line 108, 115 in TaskDetailPage.tsx) that is never tested.\n\n**Directive: \"State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately\"**\n- TDP-HDR-02 marks a task complete but doesn't verify the tasks list page reflects the updated status.\n- TDP-HDR-03 cancels/deletes a task but verifies redirect and absence from list — this one is OK.\n\nLet me check if there are any cross-cutting tests covering TaskDetailPage state changes."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":327,"cache_read_input_tokens":49206,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":327,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"90b75d5d-9ef8-4be5-84c4-8d3de19ba1a1","uuid":"19278c95-344e-47b4-80bb-789f726658cf"}

Let me summarize findings for Job 1 (CheckTestSpecTaskDetailPage).\n\nViolations found in testSpec.md directives for TaskDetailPage test entries:\n\n1. **TDP-HDR-01 missing description verification**: The components section lists \"description\" and the component renders it (TaskDetailHeader.tsx:32-36), but TDP-HDR-01 doesn't mention verifying the description field.\n\n2. **Missing test for confirm dialog dismissal**: The testSpec.md directive says \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\" TDP-HDR-02 and TDP-HDR-03 test confirming the dialogs but there's no test entry for dismissing/canceling the confirmation dialog (clicking cancel in the confirm dialog should leave the task unchanged).\n   \n3. **Client/deal links mislabeled as interactive**: The components section describes these as \"links\" but they're actually plain text spans, which is misleading given the directive to inventory every visible element systematically.\n\nThe confirmation dialogs also have a gap—their cancel behavior isn't tested, which violates the requirement to completely test modal dialog functionality.\n\nNow I need to figure out if client/deal names should actually be clickable links. The AppRevisions mentions task links on detail pages, but doesn't specify whether client/deal references on the task detail page should be navigable. The components section implies they're links, so if they should be interactive but aren't, that's a writeApp violation. Either way, the test spec doesn't cover clicking them, which is a problem if they're supposed to be functional.\n\nLooking at the components section more closely, it describes \"client/deal links\" but the test entry just says \"names\" and the actual code renders them as plain text. This mismatch between the components description and the implementation means there's both a test spec gap and a component implementation issue—if they're meant to be links, the test needs entries for navigation verification.\n\nNow I need to step back and be systematic. The task says to identify violations and add fix groups, not fix them immediately. Let me go through each directive in testSpec.md carefully for Job 1 rather than jumping ahead.\n\nLooking at the second directive about inventorying every visible element, I can see that TDP-HDR-01 covers most of the TaskDetailHeader elements like title, priority badge, and status, but it's missing the description field. The back button, Mark Complete, and Cancel Task buttons are covered by other entries, and I should check what's covered in the TaskNotesSection as well.\n\nFor the notes section, I'm seeing that TDP-NTS-01 handles the empty state and form setup, TDP-NTS-02 covers adding notes with content display and clearing the input, and TDP-NTS-03 handles deletion. There's a violation flagged where TDP-HDR-01 doesn't verify the description field. The other guidelines about not substituting easier elements and specifying exact navigation targets appear to be satisfied—the back button correctly targets the tasks list page, and Mark Complete properly shows the status change with the completed date.\n\nNow looking at the action verification, I notice the components section mentions \"client/deal links\" but there's no test entry confirming whether these are clickable or just plain text, which could be a violation if they're meant to be interactive. For data mutations like Mark Complete, I need to verify that the change persists and the side effects are exactly right.\n\nLooking at the test entries, TDP-HDR-03 effectively verifies persistence by checking the task isn't in the list after redirect, but TDP-NTS-02 and TDP-NTS-03 don't explicitly require a reload check to confirm the changes stick. Mark Complete also lacks explicit persistence verification. Additionally, the confirmation dialogs for mark complete and cancel are tested for the confirm flow, but there's no test entry for dismissing or canceling the dialog itself.\n\nFor cross-cutting concerns, marking a task complete on TaskDetailPage doesn't have a test verifying the update reflects on TasksListPage—DATA-02 only covers completing tasks on DealDetailPage. The violations also include missing description field verification in TDP-HDR-01 and incomplete coverage of the client/deal links mentioned in the Components section.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether the client/deal names should actually be clickable links—the AppRevisions say the page \"shows associated client/deal\" but don't explicitly require them to be interactive, though that's common in CRM apps. I should check if other detail pages treat these as links to determine if the testSpec is genuinely missing coverage or if the Components description is just imprecise.\n\nFor the persistence verification issue, the testSpec directive requires test entries confirming changes are persisted, but I need to look more carefully at what the existing test entries actually cover.  TDP-NTS-02 mentions \"persists\" in the title but the Expected section only describes the immediate UI state without explicitly requiring a reload verification—that's a real gap in the test spec.\n\nLet me organize these violations by their underlying cause so I can group the fixes efficiently.\n\nNow I need to check Job 2 against the component directives and Job 3 against the test

Let me check if the components section of DealDetailPage also describes \"client link\"...\n\nActually, I think the components section describing \"client/deal links\" is just inaccurate documentation. The code renders them as plain text spans. But the testSpec directive says to inventory every element and test it. If the components section says \"links\" but they're not actually links in the code, the discrepancy needs to be noted.\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-read the components section description more carefully:\n\n```\n- **TaskDetailHeader**: Back button, task title with priority badge, description, due date, assignee, client/deal links, status badge, Mark Complete and Cancel Task buttons\n\n\n```\n\nThis says \"client/deal links\" — but the code just shows plain text. This is a discrepancy between the test spec documentation and the actual code. The real question is whether the spec should describe what currently exists (plain text) or what should exist (navigable links). Since the test spec is meant to define expected behavior, calling them \"links\" suggests they should be clickable. But the implementation doesn't support that, so either the documentation is wrong or the code is incomplete.\n\nI'm tracking two violations here. For the testSpec check, the components section mentions \"client/deal links\" but there are no test cases validating link navigation. For the components check, the same mismatch exists — the spec says \"links\" but the actual component renders plain text spans. Let me proceed with the systematic verification now.\n\n```","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2914,"cache_read_input_tokens":51779,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2914,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"90b75d5d-9ef8-4be5-84c4-8d3de19ba1a1","uuid":"657fa91b-c9e0-4bc2-8e4d-b8f78be9913f"}

OK.\n\n**Checking TDP-HDR-04: Back button navigates to tasks list**\n- Specifies exact navigation target \"/tasks list page\".

The ConfirmDialog has a cancel action.\n- **VIOLATION**: Missing test entry for confirm dialog dismissal.\n\n**Directive: \"For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target\"**\n- Components section describes \"client/deal links\" implying they're clickable, but there are no test entries testing navigation from clicking them.\n- **VIOLATION**: Components section says \"client/deal links\" but no test entries verify clicking them navigates anywhere. (Note: the actual code renders them as plain text spans, not links — this is also a component violation.)\n\n**Summary of testSpec violations found:**\n1.

[2026-02-20T08:56:12.050Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01QYWLNM9vMgR1hgJuxqzv8T","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me check the backend function against writeApp.md directives:\n\n- Directive: \"When using the neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax\" — All queries use tagged template literals. ✓\n\n- Directive: \"For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`\"\n  - Line 149: `${row.due_date?.trim() || null}` — uses `|| null` ✓\n  - Line 179: `${body.due_date || null}` — uses `|| null` ✓\n  - Lines 180-181 for client_id and deal_id also properly use `|| null` ✓\n  - Line 233 handles the conditional case correctly with `|| null` ✓\n  - Line 177 uses `?? null` for description, which is fine since it's TEXT type, not DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID ✓\n\nLet me verify the remaining lines to ensure consistency across all database operations. I'm checking the path indices for nested resources — index 5 correctly captures the note ID in the deeply nested endpoint. For the component abstraction directive, TaskDetailPage properly delegates to separate components like TaskDetailHeader and TaskNotesSection, though the minimal loading and error states are rendered inline, which might technically violate the rule but seems reasonable given their simplicity.\n\nThe main issue I'm finding is that client and deal names are displayed as plain text instead of navigable links, which contradicts what the components section specifies. I should wrap up this analysis and move on to the next task. The components section of the test spec explicitly calls for \"client/deal links,\" which takes precedence over the ambiguous AppRevisions description. Since this is a CRM app where entity names are typically navigable, and the spec documentation clearly states links should be present, I'll flag this as a violation that needs fixing.\n\nNow moving to Job 3 to verify the task-detail-page tests against the writeTests.md requirements. The navigation assertions are properly checking URLs after clicks, and I'm examining whether side effect assertions verify both the primary action and its consequences.\n\nThe status change test covers the main effect and button visibility, but the timeline entry that should be created when completing a task with a client_id isn't being verified—though this is acceptable since the test intentionally creates a task without a client_id, so there's no timeline entry to check. The tests consistently use getByTestId instead of getByText, avoiding substring matching issues, and all test IDs align with their component counterparts.\n\nFor file uploads, this doesn't apply to TaskDetailPage. Looking at the Playwright locator usage in the retry block, it's using a single auto-waiting assertion rather than iterating over dynamic elements, which should be fine, but...\n\nActually, there's a conflict between the inner `expect().toBeVisible()` auto-wait and the `.toPass()` retry mechanism that could cause issues. The cleaner approach would be to skip the `.toPass()` wrapper entirely and let the locator's timeout handle the wait directly. I'm seeing this same pattern repeated across multiple test cases—lines 91-94, 139-142, 160-163, and 179-182 all have the same structure. This is a violation of the directive to use atomic assertions without nested retry logic.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test titles actually match their test IDs. TDP-HDR-01 looks correct, but I need to verify the rest of them. All tests are passing the parallel test design requirement since they create their own records and don't depend on fixed database counts. I'm now reviewing TDP-HDR-01 to verify it captures all the required task detail fields like title, priority, status, due date, assignee, and client/deal information.\n\nLooking at the actual test implementation, I see it only validates title, status, and notes visibility, but it's missing assertions for priority badge, due date, assignee, and client/deal names. The test entry description promises to show all these elements, so the test needs to be expanded to verify each one.\n\nThere's also a mismatch where the test checks for a notes section that isn't part of TDP-HDR-01's requirements at all—that test is specifically about the task header display. And there's a practical issue: the test just grabs the first task card without knowing if it has all these fields populated, yet the entry implies they should all be visible.\n\nFor TDP-NTS-02, the test verifies note content appears and the input clears, but it skips checking that the author and timestamp are actually displayed separately—a gap between what the test entry promises and what the test actually validates.\n\nLooking at the broader pattern, there are multiple instances where single auto-wait assertions are unnecessarily wrapped in `.toPass()`, which adds unnecessary complexity.\n\nNow I'm organizing these issues into logical fix groups: one for missing test entries and spec gaps, another for making client and deal names into navigable links with corresponding tests, a third for filling in the missing assertions in the header test, and a fourth for cleaning up the `.toPass()` wrapper pattern throughout the test file. I should consolidate these further since fixes #2 and #4 both address incompleteness in TDP-HDR-01, and fix #1 already spans multiple areas. That leaves me with four core FixViolation jobs: one for the client/deal links across spec and code, one for completing TDP-HDR-01, one for the confirm dialog test, and one for the .toPass() pattern cleanup, plus the author/timestamp assertions for TDP-NTS-02. I'm organizing the fixes into five clear groups: completing the HDR-01 test with missing assertions, adding the confirm dialog dismissal test, making client and deal names into navigable links with corresponding tests, replacing the incorrect .toPass() patterns, and adding author/timestamp assertions to the notes test. I'm reconsidering the grouping strategy to handle each issue end-to-end, making sure to update test entries, test code, component code, and documentation together. So I'll organize around four cohesive fix groups: one for TDP-HDR-01 completeness, one for the confirm dialog dismissal test, one for making client/deal links navigable, and one for fixing the .toPass() patterns and NTS-02 assertions. I'm organizing the fixes into four focused groups, each with the same structure: a specific violation fix, test verification, and documentation. The first three groups handle updating the TDP-HDR-01 test entry with missing assertions, adding a new confirm dialog dismissal test, and making client and deal names navigable with corresponding test coverage. I'm about to define the fourth group.\n\nActually, let me consolidate these more aggressively—combining the test spec fixes into one group and the test code violations into another, so I'm working with two larger batches instead of four smaller ones. assertions, add TDP-HDR-05 test, add client/deal link navigation tests, replace .toPass() patterns, add NTS-02 author/timestamp assertions\n- RunTests: Verify tests pass\n- DocumentFix: Document the fix\n\nHmm, but Group 1 is making component changes AND test spec changes, which might be too much for one job. Let me think...\n\nActually, I think the most practical approach is:\n\n**Group 1**: Fix all testSpec violations (update docs/tests.md entries) + component code changes (client/deal links)\n**Group 2**: Fix all test code violations (update spec.ts)\n**Group 3**: Run tests to verify everything\n\nBut the template says each fix group should have RunTests + DocumentFix. Let me just follow the template strictly and create separate groups for each violation.\n\nActually, the strategy tip says I should group related fix tasks into a single FixViolation job when they share the same root cause. Looking at what needs fixing, I can identify the underlying issues: incomplete test entry for TDP-HDR-01, missing confirm dialog dismissal test, client/deal not rendering as links, improper .toPass() usage patterns, and incomplete assertions for TDP-NTS-02. I'll organize these by root cause rather than by file, so I can batch related changes together more efficiently. Looking more carefully at what constitutes actual violations versus stylistic preferences, I can identify four clear ones: the test entry missing the description field despite it being listed in components, no test coverage for dismissing the confirm dialog, test code that doesn't verify the priority badge and due date fields mentioned in the entry, and the improper use of .toPass() around single assertions. The client/deal links question is murkier—the components section describes them as links but the test entry just says \"names,\" so I'm not sure if that's a real discrepancy or just different ways of describing the same thing.\n\nFor TDP-NTS-02, the test only checks that noteContent appears in the section, but the entry explicitly requires verifying content, author, and timestamp are all displayed. Since author and timestamp are rendered separately from the content, I need to add specific assertions for those. Now I'm grouping these fixes logically: first I'll address the TaskDetailPage header issues by adding the missing description to TDP-HDR-01 and creating a new test entry for the confirm dialog dismissal, then I'll fix the test code violations. I'm realizing I should split this into two groups to keep the scope manageable—first I'll update the test spec and make the component changes, then handle all the test code fixes
