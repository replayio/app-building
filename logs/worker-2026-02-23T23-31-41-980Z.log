If you did not find any relevant tests, add at least one new test entry which checks\nthat the bug doesn't occur.\n\nFor any changes to the test spec you made, update the test files themselves to reflect those changes.\n\nAfter updating tests, make sure they pass. Read `strategies/jobs/build/testing.md` to understand how to run tests and debug failures.\n\n## Updating revisions\n\nIf the bug fix changed the app's behavior relative to the original `AppSpec.md` — for example,\nadding new functionality, removing a feature, or changing how something works — update\n`AppRevisions.md` (create the file next to `AppSpec.md` if it doesn't exist).\n\n`AppRevisions.md` is NOT a changelog. It is organized by topic sections that describe either\nnew functionality added to the app or changes made to the app spec in particular areas. Each\nsection has a heading describing the area (e.g., \"## Attachment Uploads\", \"## Authentication\",\n\"## CSV Import\") and a description of the current state of that functionality.\n\nWhen updating revisions:\n- If an existing section covers the area you changed, update that section's description to\n  reflect the current behavior.\n- If the change introduces a new area of functionality, add a new section.\n- Keep descriptions focused on **what the app does now**, not a history of changes.\n\nIf the fix was purely a code bug that didn't change the intended behavior, skip this step.\n\n## Resolving bugs\n\nNow that the bug is fixed, move it from the top section of the file to an \"Unreviewed\" section lower down.\nLabel the bug with the git revision before / after the bug was fixed and tests updated.\n\nMove the report to the appropriate section in `docs/bugReports.md`.\n","numLines":80,"startLine":1,"totalLines":80}}}
