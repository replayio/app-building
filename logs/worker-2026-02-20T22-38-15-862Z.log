Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"31600b8e-62d6-4fbd-a56a-9a739f8c8a06","uuid":"e12fefa0-f180-4324-9a45-d20125ece3ba","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecSettingsPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in SettingsPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n1. **Images consistency**: \"Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\" → N/A for Settings since there's no specific mention of settings in AppSpec.md\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element**: \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\" → Need to check if all visible elements in the components are tested.\n\n\n3. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements**: \"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\" → Check if test entries are faithful to the actual implementation.\n\n4. **Clickable elements must specify exact navigation**: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\" → Check all clickable elements in test entries.\n\n5. **Mutations must verify persistence and side effects**: \"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur.\" → Check that mutation test entries verify persistence.\n\n6. **Button specifications**: Need to continue checking the remaining directives about button behavior and other requirements. and control appearance**: \"Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance.\" → Check if test entries verify button text/icons.\n\n7. **Modal dialogs**: \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\" → Check modals are thoroughly tested.\n\n8. **Attachment file uploads**: \"Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\" → Not directly relevant to Settings page.\n\n9. **Import/upload dialogs**: \"Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\" → Very relevant for ImportExportSection.\n\n10. **Backend integrations**: \"Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field.\" → Very relevant for WebhookSection.\n\n11. **State-changing actions**: \"State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately.\" → Check cross-cutting effects.\n\nNow I'm going through each test entry to verify coverage. Starting with SettingsPageHeader, which tests visibility of the header and main sections — that looks solid. For ImportExportSection, the first entry covers button visibility, and the subsequent entries handle the import dialog specifics.\n\nChecking the import dialogs now — they verify CSV column requirements, the \"required\" markers, file input functionality, template download buttons, and disabled states. The format documentation visibility requirement is covered. Moving to export CSV buttons, which test the download functionality with correct filenames and columns.\n\nFor WebhookSection, the empty state test covers the heading, description, add button, and empty message. The add webhook modal test is thorough, checking the setup guide, platform buttons, form inputs, payload toggle, and save button disabled state.\n\nNow reviewing the webhook creation and persistence tests — they verify that filling in name and URL, selecting events, and saving actually persists the webhook across reloads. The platform setup guide test confirms that Zapier, n8n, and custom instructions are shown with the collapse functionality, which satisfies the requirement for platform-specific setup instructions. The payload format toggle test checks the JSON example visibility, deletion includes a confirmation dialog, and the enable/disable toggle persists its state.\n\nFor the notification preferences section, I'm checking that all seven toggles appear with the correct test IDs when authenticated, that toggling one persists across reload, and that the entire section hides when not authenticated while other sections remain visible.\n\nRe-reading the directive about systematically inventorying every visible element — I need to make sure I'm not missing any UI components that should have their own test entries.\n\nLooking at the SettingsPageHeader, it displays a Settings icon alongside the \"Settings\" title. My current test checks that the header is visible and contains the text, but I'm not explicitly verifying the icon itself. The directive emphasizes testing every visible element including icons, so I should consider whether the icon needs its own assertion or if checking the header's visibility is sufficient coverage. Icons at the E2E level are typically validated through component visibility rather than isolated icon assertions, but the directive's emphasis on \"every visible element\" suggests I might need to be more explicit about icon presence.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking for violations across the test entries. The ImportExportSection has Download and Upload icons paired with button text, but my test STP-IE-01 only validates button visibility by testid without confirming the specific text labels or icons are present. The directive is clear that button appearance—including text and icons—should be verified, not just that buttons exist. I need to examine what STP-IE-01 actually covers versus what the mockup shows. Looking at the directive more carefully, it only applies when there's a mockup showing specific styling—since there's no mockup for the settings page in the AppSpec, this requirement may not be relevant here. The components were built directly from the test spec itself, so I should check whether the test spec actually requires icon verification. settings page.\n\nI searched for \"setting\" in AppSpec.md and got no matches. So there's no settings page in the AppSpec. The settings page must have been added via AppRevisions.md. But AppRevisions.md doesn't exist. Hmm...\n\nActually, the settings page seems to have been built based on the test spec entries themselves, without a mockup. So the mockup-related directives may not be strictly applicable (since there's no mockup to compare against).\n\nLet me focus on the directives that are clearly applicable:\n\n1. **Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format** ✅ - All import dialogs in the test entries specify CSV columns and their requirements.\n\n2. **Backend integrations... must include complete setup instructions** ✅ - The webhook test entries (STP-WH-02, STP-WH-04) include setup guide testing for Zapier, n8n, and Custom platforms.\n\n3. **For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result** ✅ - All button clicks specify what should happen.\n\n4. **For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly** ✅ - STP-WH-03, STP-WH-07, STP-WH-08, STP-NP-02 all verify persistence after page reload.\n\n5. **Completely test that modal dialogs work properly** ✅ - Both WebhookModal and ImportDialog are tested.\n\n6. **State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately** - This is about cross-cutting effects. For example, importing clients should show them on the clients list page. However, there are no test entries that verify this kind of integration between features.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider directive 6. The directive says \"For example: If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry.\" This is specifically about timeline/history features. The import/export functionality creates records, and if there's a timeline feature tracking mutations, importing records should create timeline entries. The test entries for import don't verify any timeline/history impact. Let me check if the app has a timeline feature by looking at the cross-cutting test entries like ATOM-01, ATOM-02, ATOM-03...\n\nYes, there is a timeline feature. But import is a bulk operation, so it's reasonable that bulk imports don't create individual timeline entries. This doesn't seem like a clear violation.\n\nNow I'm thinking about what else might be missing. The test entries don't have a test for the actual file upload mechanics. STP-IE-02 checks that a file input exists and the Import button is disabled until a file is selected, but there's no test entry that actually uploads a file via the import dialog to verify the import workflow end-to-end. Is this a violation?\n\nLooking at the testSpec directive about import/upload dialogs needing to specify expected data format and verify that format documentation is visible to the user—that's covered. But the writeTests directive mentions file upload functionality, and I need to check what that says about testing the actual upload process.\n\nActually, I'm realizing there's no test entry for performing an actual import—uploading a CSV file and verifying the data is imported. The testSpec directive requires that every interactive element be tested and that the test verify the element actually works and does what the user expects. So clicking the Import button should do something, and the imported data should be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n\nThe same issue applies to the \"Download CSV template\" button—it's mentioned as visible but there's no test entry that actually clicks it and verifies a template CSV is downloaded. me re-read the test entry STP-IE-02:\n> \"The dialog contains a CSV column format specification table (data-testid='csv-format-info')... A 'Download CSV template' button (data-testid='download-template-button'), a file input (data-testid='csv-file-input'), Cancel button (data-testid='import-cancel-button'), and Import button (data-testid='import-submit-button') which is disabled until a file is selected.\"\n\nThese elements are listed as being present (visible), but there's no separate test entry for clicking the template download button or for actually importing a file. The directive says \"every interactive element... must be tested\" and \"the test must verify that the interactive element actually works.\"\n\nSo I see potential violations:\n1. **No test entry for actual CSV import workflow** - The import submit button and file input are interactive elements that aren't exercised (the test entry only checks the button exists and is disabled, not that it works).\n2. **No test entry for Download CSV template button** - The button is tested for visibility but not for functionality.\n\nWait, but these are testSpec directives. Let me re-read: \"Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\"\n\nSo every interactive element needs a test entry. The Download CSV template button and the actual Import functionality need test entries. For testSpec violations, I'm looking at missing test entries for the template download button's functionality and the actual import workflow—both interactive elements that should be exercised, not just verified for existence. file input, Import submit button, and Cancel button are interactive elements that aren't being tested for their actual functionality. The directive is strict about this—every interactive element needs to be exercised. So I'm identifying three clear violations: the Download CSV template button has no test at all, the file input and Import button aren't tested for an actual import workflow, and the Cancel button isn't tested either. I should flag these as gaps that need test entries. Looking at the import dialogs across the four entity types, I think testing one complete import flow should be sufficient since they're using the same component, though I do need at least one test entry that exercises the full workflow. Now scanning through the notification preferences and webhook sections—the toggles are covered in existing tests, and the Add Webhook button is tested, so those areas check out.\n\nFor the webhook list items and their interactive elements, I'm verifying that the name, URL, event badges, enable/disable toggle, edit button, and delete button are all exercised across the test entries, plus the empty state. The webhook modal's platform buttons and input fields are also accounted for in the test coverage.\n\nI've identified that the only gaps in the testSpec are around the ImportDialog—specifically missing tests for the actual CSV import workflow and the Download CSV template button functionality.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the SettingsPage components for any writeApp.md directive violations. I'm realizing the JSX comments requirement actually comes from testSpec.md, not writeApp.md. Let me refocus on the actual writeApp.md directives: ensuring test entries are satisfied, matching visual mockups, adding data-testid attributes, and configuring the Netlify base path for the monorepo setup.\n\nNow I'm checking the implementation against the requirements—verifying that SettingsPageHeader and ImportExportSection have the proper data-testid attributes on their root elements and interactive sections.\n\nContinuing through WebhookSection, I'm confirming that the webhook management features include testids for the section container, the add button, empty state, and individual webhook items with their associated metadata.\n\nNow moving into WebhookModal.tsx, I'm verifying testids for the modal itself, the setup guide, platform-specific sections with their instructions and tips, and the name input field.\n\nContinuing through the modal's remaining elements—the URL input, event toggles, payload display options, and action buttons all have proper testids. Then checking NotificationPreferencesSection.tsx, where I'm confirming testids on the section container, preference labels, and toggle buttons for each notification type.\n\nNow moving through ImportDialog.tsx to verify all its interactive pieces are covered—the dialog itself, format information, template download button, file input, results display, and cancel/submit buttons all have testids. I've also confirmed there are no native select elements anywhere in the Settings components, and the settings page doesn't have its own navigation to worry about duplicates.\n\nMapping the test requirements against actual component behavior: the SettingsPage renders its header, notification preferences, import/export, and webhook sections as expected. The notification section correctly hides when the user isn't logged in, which aligns with what STP-NP-03 checks for. Now I need to verify the backend functions are using Neon's tagged template literal syntax where required.\n\nActually, stepping back—the job is specifically about checking the frontend SettingsPage components for directive violations, not the backend functions. Those would be covered in a separate backend check. I should stay focused on the React components themselves rather than diving into the Netlify functions.\n\nLooking at the remaining writeApp directives for the frontend, the webhook modal uses text inputs for name and URL along with event checkboxes, so it doesn't need a searchable dropdown for entity references. I don't see any native HTML select elements either. Now I'm checking the attachment display requirements.\n\nThe import dialog has a proper file input element for CSV uploads, which satisfies the file upload requirement. For the layout-agnostic component guideline, I'm noticing that NotificationPreferencesSection has padding applied directly to its root element, while the other sections like ImportExportSection and WebhookSection handle padding differently through nested elements. I see the distinction now — the `p-5` on NotificationPreferencesSection's root is internal card padding, not outer spacing that would conflict with the parent's gap control, so it's consistent with how the other sections handle their internal padding through nested elements. The SettingsPage manages the spacing between components, and each section handles its own internal layout, which aligns with the directive.\n\nNow I'm checking whether all JSX on the page is properly abstracted into separate components, and it looks like SettingsPageHeader, ImportExportSection, WebhookSection, WebhookModal, and NotificationPreferencesSection are all in their own files as expected. I'm checking whether the modal components follow the searchable select pattern for entity references — the import dialog handles CSV uploads rather than ID inputs, and the webhook modal doesn't reference entities, so this directive doesn't apply. Now I'm cross-referencing the test spec entries against the actual component implementations to verify they match the requirements, starting with the import dialog's CSV column format specification.\n\nThe webhook modal's save button correctly disables until name, URL, and at least one event are provided, the platform button toggles to collapse instructions when clicked again, notification preferences default to all enabled, and the preferences section properly hides when the user isn't authenticated.\n\nNow I'm checking whether interactive elements have JSX comments documenting which tests exercise them — this is a testSpec requirement, not a writeApp concern, so it falls outside the scope of what I'm currently validating. I'm scanning through each component to check for JSX comments next to interactive elements, and finding systematic violations across the board — ImportExportSection, WebhookSection, WebhookModal, NotificationPreferencesSection, and ImportDialog all have interactive elements but no comments linking them to their test titles.

This confirms the violation.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully, only 3 comments exist across the entire app. It seems like this was only partially implemented. But the testSpec directive is clear: \"There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\"\n\nSince this is a systemic issue across the entire app (not just settings), I should still flag it for the Settings page specifically.\n\nLet me also check one more thing - the backend functions related to settings to see if there are writeApp directive violations. \n\nActually, I'm getting sidetracked here. The job is specifically about writeApp.md directives in SettingsPage components on the frontend, not the backend. Let me refocus and wrap up my findings.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the writeTests.md directives in the SettingsPage tests. The key requirements are that tests must verify navigation targets precisely by asserting URL and page content after clicks, and for actions with side effects...\n\nChecking the navigation tests first — the settings page tests don't actually have any navigation clicks to other pages, so that's not applicable here. Moving on to verify side effects are being tested correctly...\n\nThe webhook creation test verifies the new webhook appears in the list and persists, the deletion test confirms removal and the empty state returns, and both the toggle tests check that persistence works as expected. All the side effects look properly covered.\n\nFor the getByText usage, I'm scanning through the test file and seeing getTestId calls throughout, some locator queries with hasText matchers, but no direct getByText calls, which is good. Now I need to check the data-testid consistency across the file...\n\nThe test IDs I'm seeing match up with their corresponding components—settings-page-header, webhook-modal, import-dialog, confirm-dialog, and confirm-ok all line up with what's in the actual component files. That's solid alignment.\n\nLooking at the file upload tests though, I notice they're checking that the file input element exists and that the Import button is disabled initially, but they're not actually exercising the file upload mechanism itself with setInputFiles. The test descriptions don't mention file upload actions either, so there's a gap in coverage there.\n\nActually, wait—the spec does say the Import button is \"disabled until a file is selected,\" which implies that selecting a file is part of the expected behavior. So either the test spec is incomplete because it's missing entries for the actual file selection and import flow, or the tests themselves need to be expanded to cover what the spec is implying. The test spec describes file upload functionality—selecting a file should enable the button—but the current test only verifies the button is disabled, not that it becomes enabled after selection. This feels like a borderline case since the spec doesn't explicitly list file selection as an action step, so I'd lean toward calling this a testSpec violation (incomplete test entry) rather than a writeTests violation. Moving on to check for `.toPass()` usage and field/interaction coverage in the rest of the tests.\n\nLooking through the webhook and notification tests, I'm seeing good alignment: the webhook creation test covers name and URL entry, the edit test verifies pre-filled values and saves changes as specified, and the notification toggle tests confirm all seven toggles display correctly and respond to clicks. The persistence verification for toggled notifications also matches the spec. For the e2e signup/signin requirement, the settings page tests appear to inherit authentication from the base setup, so that should be covered.\n\nNow I'm noticing a gap in the CSV export tests—they verify the download filename but don't actually validate the CSV content itself. The spec explicitly lists required columns like Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, and Open Deals, but the test only checks the filename. This looks like it violates the directive about exercising exact fields mentioned in the spec. The spec entries for these export tests explicitly list the CSV columns that should be present, but the actual test implementations only verify the filename—they never read or validate the CSV content itself. This is a direct violation of the directive that requires testing each described interaction; the column headers are part of what's being described and need to be verified.\n\nI'm also checking for other common test issues like `.first()` workarounds for ambiguous selectors or problematic `getByText` substring matching, but the test file uses more specific locator patterns and assertions like `toContainText`, so those look fine.\n\nNow compiling my findings: the main violation is that the CSV import workflow isn't fully exercised—the file input, Import button, and Download template button are all interactive elements mentioned in test entries but not actually tested for functionality. Additionally, there are no JSX comments next to interactive elements documenting which tests cover them, though this is a broader issue across the codebase rather than specific to settings.\n\nFor the SettingsPage components themselves, I'm not finding any writeApp.md directive violations—the data-testid attributes are all in place.\n\nLooking at the test coverage for exports, I notice the CSV tests are only verifying the download filename, not the actual column headers in the CSV content that the test entries specify should be validated.\n\nSo I'm looking at three distinct fix groups: adding the missing import flow test entries and corresponding test implementation, adding JSX comments to all interactive elements in the settings components, and updating the export CSV tests to actually verify the column structure. I'm realizing I should follow the strategy more carefully—each group needs a clear root cause, and not every fix needs documentation or test runs. For the JSX comments, running tests isn't necessary since comments don't affect behavior. Let me refocus on what's actually needed: adding the missing test entries and writing corresponding tests for the import workflow, adding JSX comments to the settings components, and updating the export CSV tests to verify headers.\n\nBut I'm second-guessing the scope here. The job specifically asks about SettingsPage test entry violations, and the JSX comment directive is about component code, not test entries themselves. Let me check what the testSpec actually requires—it says interactive elements must be tested with comments in the JS code marking them.\n\nSince the directive ties test entries to code comments, this is a legitimate test entry violation if the comments are missing. The issue is pervasive across the whole app, but I should focus on what I found in the settings page and flag it accordingly. Let me organize the fixes now.\n\nI'm seeing three distinct violations: missing test entries for the import workflow, missing JSX comments throughout settings, and incomplete test coverage for the CSV export feature. The first two are about test documentation gaps, while the third is about weak test implementation. The import workflow issue and CSV tests both involve coverage gaps, but they stem from different problems—one's about missing entries in the test spec, the other about inadequate assertions in existing tests. I'll keep them separate to maintain clarity on what needs
