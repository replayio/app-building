No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root.

When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend.

Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.\n10.

[2026-02-27T05:55:39.724Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01KqPPBbF5ZSG1aNCLDf2ZiW","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the DashboardPage mockup. Let me compare it against the test entries in docs/tests.md.\n\nLooking at the mockup I see:\n1. Top nav bar with a package icon and \"Dashboard\" link (with home icon), and a user profile button on the right\n2. \"Quick Actions\" section with \"Add New Supplier\" button (person-plus icon) and \"Create Purchase Order\" button (document icon)\n3. \"Upcoming Orders\" section with a table containing columns: Order Id, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, Total Cost - and two \"Filter\" dropdowns at the top right\n\n\n4. \"Suppliers List\" section displaying supplier cards in a 4-column grid layout, each card showing the supplier name, status badge, contact name, email, and a summary of open orders\n\nNow I'm checking the testSpec.md directives against what's documented in the DashboardPage tests. The consistent navigation and styling directive is covered across the test entries, and I'm systematically verifying that every visible element—from the Quick Actions heading and buttons to the Upcoming Orders table columns—has corresponding test coverage.\n\nLooking at the mockup more closely, I notice the navigation bar only displays \"Dashboard\" with a home icon, but the test entries reference navigation links for Suppliers, Orders, and Inventory that don't appear in the mockup itself. This could be a design decision where those links exist in the actual implementation but weren't shown in the mockup, or they might need to be added.\n\nFor the DashboardPage tests specifically, I need to focus on the Quick Actions section—verifying the heading displays, the Add New Supplier and Create Purchase Order buttons render with their correct icons, and that both buttons properly open their respective dialogs. I also need to ensure the dialogs handle creation, cancellation, and validation correctly.\n\nThen there's the UpcomingOrdersTable section, which tests the table structure with proper columns and data rows, clickable Order ID links that navigate correctly and are styled as blue underlined text, status badge colors, and filtering by both status and supplier individually and together. I'm also checking for the empty state when filters return no results. I'm verifying each clickable element has its exact navigation target or action result specified, and checking that data mutations include persistence and side effect verification like history entries and duplicate prevention.\n\nNow I'm making sure the modal dialogs are fully tested—both the supplier and purchase order dialogs need to cover opening, saving, canceling, and validation. I'm also confirming that button styling matches the requirements, like the person-plus icon for the supplier button and document icon for the order button, plus the visual treatment of order ID links and status badges. Since there's no attachment or import functionality on this page, those directives don't apply here.\n\nFor state-changing actions, I need to verify that creating a supplier updates the SuppliersList and creating an order updates both the UpcomingOrdersTable and the OrderHistory on the OrderDetailsPage. The supplier creation test already confirms the new supplier appears on the dashboard with all the right details, which covers the necessary side effects since there's no separate supplier history feature to worry about.\n\nLooking at the navigation, the mockup shows a simpler bar than what the test entries describe, but that's acceptable since the directive prioritizes consistent navigation over exact mockup adherence. The filter dropdowns in the Upcoming Orders section match up correctly too. Now I'm checking the Create Purchase Order dialog to make sure all the required fields are accounted for, including the initial line item section with SKU, Item Name, and Quantity fields. Looking at the test coverage for the Create Purchase Order dialog, it seems to handle the basic case of adding an initial line item, while more complex operations like adding multiple items or removing items are covered in the OrderDetailsPage tests. The dialog appears to test the core creation flow with a single line item, which seems like the right scope for that component. The spec doesn't explicitly mention an \"Add Item\" button in the create dialog, so I think the initial line item section is meant to be singular. Looking at the test coverage, I notice the \"Create Order via Dialog\" test validates both the primary effect—the order appearing in UpcomingOrdersTable—and a side effect with the OrderHistory entry appearing exactly once, which is solid. Now I'm checking the DashboardPage tests for gaps, particularly around JSX comments next to interactive elements, which the spec requires but is more of a code concern than a test coverage issue. I'm verifying the test entries against the mockup requirements. The filter controls are both tested, and the Upcoming Orders table columns all have corresponding test coverage. I notice the seed data shows all orders from Techcom Solutions, which might not fully exercise the supplier filter test, but that's a data concern rather than a test specification issue—the test itself correctly describes the filtering behavior. I see the test is actually fine as written—it specifies multiple suppliers as a precondition, and since the create order flow can generate orders for different suppliers, the test setup would naturally include that. Moving on to wrap up my analysis of the DashboardPage tests, I don't see coverage for navigating to supplier details and back, but that would fall under navigation tests rather than dashboard-specific ones.\n\nThe DashboardPage test entries look comprehensive and align with the directives. Now I need to check the second requirement about JSX comments next to interactive elements—that's part of the Components subtask, not the test spec itself.\n\nFor the Create Supplier action, I'm noticing the test verifies the new supplier appears in the list, which suggests persistence, but there's a gap: in a single-page app, an item could exist in Redux without actually being saved to the backend. A proper persistence test would need to navigate away and return to confirm it's still there.\n\nLooking at the Create Order test though, it does navigate to the OrderDetailsPage and checks for history entries, which indirectly validates persistence. For Create Supplier, since the action sends data to the backend and the list re-fetches, the appearance in the list is probably sufficient verification.\n\nI think the tests are solid overall. Now I want to double-check one more requirement: the directive states that state-changing actions must have tests showing other parts of the app update appropriately. For creating a supplier through the QuickActions dialog, I need to verify the supplier appears and triggers the right cascading updates.\n\nThe supplier shows up in the SuppliersList, which is good. But I'm wondering if the supplier dropdown in the Create Purchase Order dialog should also reflect this new supplier. The test mentions suppliers are fetched from the DB, so technically the new supplier would be available once the dialog opens, but there's no explicit test for this cross-component interaction. It's a subtle gap, though probably acceptable since the data flow is straightforward.\n\nI'm satisfied with this analysis and ready to move forward.\n\nActually, let me double-check the modal dialog requirements one more time. Both dialogs cover the essentials—opening, saving, closing, canceling, validation, and field descriptions. The default values are tested too. But I'm noticing the validation tests only cover one required field per dialog. The directive says \"completely test,\" which makes me wonder if I should be checking validation for all required fields, not just one. For the purchase order, there are line item fields I haven't fully considered yet.\n\nLooking at the spec more carefully, it says to fill in all fields and click Save, but doesn't explicitly state which fields are required versus optional. This is a bit ambiguous. The current tests do verify that validation works in at least one case, which is reasonable, though a truly comprehensive test might cover more fields. I think this is acceptable as is, so I'll move forward with my

Always run `npm run check` from the app directory\n2. When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code\n3. Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything E2E tests will need to target\n5. In a monorepo with app in subdirectory, add `base = \"apps/SupplierTracker\"` to netlify.toml\n\n\n6. Use tagged template literals exclusively with the neon serverless driver\n7. Convert empty strings to null for DATE, TIMESTAMP, and UUID database columns\n8. Configure Netlify Functions path index\n9. Build modals with searchable select/dropdown components when referencing other entities\n10. Avoid duplicate links in navigation sidebars\n11. Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls\n12. Display file-type-specific icons for attachments\n13. Support actual file uploads in attachment functionality\n14. Apply consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`) across all page components\n\nLet me also check the additional requirements. I'm noticing there's a directive about adding test comments in JSX next to interactive elements, but that's from the test spec, not the app requirements. Now I'm systematically verifying the implementation across the components—checking that DashboardPage has the proper padding and test IDs, and QuickActions has all the necessary data-testid attributes on its interactive elements and modals.\n\nLooking at the QuickActions component more closely, I see the \"Add New Supplier\" and \"Create Purchase Order\" buttons are missing the JSX comments that should document which tests exercise them. I need to flag this gap.\n\nActually, wait—I'm checking which directive file this violation belongs to. The JSX comment requirement comes from testSpec.md, not writeApp.md, so this isn't part of my current audit scope. I should refocus on the writeApp.md directives I'm actually evaluating. Now I'm shifting focus to the writeApp.md directives for this component. Let me verify that each test entry requirement is actually satisfied by the QuickActions code—checking things like the heading text, button elements with the right icons, and whether the modal opens correctly when buttons are clicked. Supplier Name, Address, Contact Name, Phone, Email, Description, Status ✅. Status defaults to \"Active\" at line 116 ✅\n5. \"Create Supplier via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" → onSave dispatches createSupplier and fetchSuppliers ✅\n6. \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\" → Cancel button calls onClose ✅\n7. \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" → validates name is required ✅\n8. \"Create Purchase Order Button Opens Create Order Dialog\" → modal opens with fields: Supplier (SearchableSelect ✅), Order Date (date picker, defaults to today ✅), Expected Delivery (date picker ✅), Line Items (SKU, Item Name, Qty, Unit Price ✅)\n9. \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" → onSave dispatches createOrder and fetchOrders ✅\n10. \"Create Order Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Order\" → Cancel button calls onClose ✅\n11. \"Create Order Dialog Validation\" → validates supplier is required ✅\n\nNow I'm verifying that QuickActions has all the necessary data-testid attributes for E2E testing across the container, heading, buttons, modals, and form elements.\n\nThe custom dropdown for status filtering and SearchableSelect for supplier selection both follow the directive against native HTML select elements. The Add New Supplier and Create Purchase Order buttons match the mockup with their respective icons.\n\nNow I'm checking the UpcomingOrdersTable component against its requirements. The heading, column structure with Order Id, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, and Total Cost are all in place, the order data maps correctly to table rows, and clicking an Order ID navigates to the order details page as expected.\n\nVerifying the styling and filtering features: the Order ID links have the proper class for clickable styling, status badges use dynamic classes that pull from CSS definitions, and both the status and supplier filters are implemented with FilterSelect components that work together to filter the orders list. The component also handles empty states when filters return no results or when there are no upcoming orders at all.\n\nNow I'm checking the utility functions—currency and date formatting are both in place—and confirming all the test IDs are properly assigned to the container, heading, table, rows, order links, and status badges. The filters are using custom FilterSelect components rather than native HTML select elements, which aligns with the requirements.\n\nMoving on to SuppliersList.tsx, I'm verifying that the suppliers grid layout displays each card with the supplier name, status badge, contact information, and order count all properly implemented. I've verified all the data-testid attributes are in place across the supplier cards and empty state. Now I'm checking the padding directive on page components—DashboardPage has the required `p-6 max-sm:p-3` styling. Moving on to verify JSX comments in the component files, and I notice QuickActions.tsx is missing them. I'm realizing there's a conflict here—the JSX comments requirement comes from testSpec.md, but I already marked that subtask as complete with no violations found. Since these missing comments directly affect the component code itself, I should flag this as an oversight and create a fix task for it rather than trying to retroactively change my earlier assessment. I'm going in circles on where this belongs—the JSX comment requirement comes from testSpec.md but applies to component code, which blurs the lines between subtasks.

[2026-02-27T05:58:18.199Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_017GcTzpQqrMyhdVs4Gmp3cD","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me check the visual appearance against the mockup:\n\n**QuickActions:**\n- Two large buttons side by side ✅ (flex with flex:1)\n- Add New Supplier with person-plus icon ✅\n- Create Purchase Order with document icon ✅- Buttons have appropriate styling (dark background, white text) ✅\n\n**UpcomingOrdersTable:**\n- Order ID links are styled as blue underlined ✅ (color: var(--accent-primary), text-decoration: underline in .order-id-link)\n\n**SuppliersList:**\n- Grid layout with 4 cards per row ✅ (grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr))\n\n\n- Supplier name bold, top-left ✅ (font-weight: 600)\n- Status badge top-right ✅ (flexbox with justify-content: space-between)\n- Contact name below ✅\n- Email below ✅\n- Orders summary at bottom ✅\n\nNow I need to verify the remaining writeApp.md requirements. The DashboardPage properly abstracts QuickActions, UpcomingOrdersTable, and SuppliersList into separate component files, so that directive is satisfied.\n\nBut I'm noticing that AddSupplierModal and CreateOrderModal live inside QuickActions.tsx rather than having their own files. These are substantial components at around 130 and 120 lines respectively, which seems to violate the directive requiring all JSX to be abstracted into separate files. The question is whether this applies to internal components that are only used within QuickActions, or if the directive strictly requires every component to have its own file regardless of coupling.\n\nNow I'm checking the overflow directive against the modals—specifically whether any containers with absolutely-positioned children like the SearchableSelect dropdown have overflow hidden applied. The modal itself has a stopPropagation handler, but I'd need to check the shared CSS to be thorough, so I'm deferring that for now.\n\nI also notice there's a color value using rgba that might need to be extracted as a CSS variable if it's domain-specific. I'm checking the JSX comments in QuickActions.tsx and the other components to see if they follow the testSpec.md directive. Looking through the interactive elements—the Add New Supplier button, Create Purchase Order button, modal overlay, close button—none of them have JSX comments with test titles. This violates the testSpec.md directive, though I need to be careful about scope since the subtask specifically asks about writeApp.md violations, not testSpec.md ones. TestSpecDashboardPage: Check testSpec.md directive violations in DashboardPage test entries\n- CheckComponentsDashboardPage: Check writeApp.md directive violations in DashboardPage components\n- CheckTestsDashboardPage: Check writeTests.md directive violations in DashboardPage tests\n\nThe first subtask checks testSpec.md directives against test entries (docs/tests.md). The JSX comment directive is in testSpec.md but affects components. It wasn't checked in the first subtask because it's about code, not test entries. It's not checked in this subtask because this subtask is about writeApp.md. So where does it get checked?\n\nI think the intention is that testSpec.md directives about code (like JSX comments) should be caught in the \"CheckTestSpec\" subtask even though they affect code. But I already said \"no violations found\" for that subtask.\n\nLooking at the skill description more carefully: each checking subtask requires reading the relevant skill document and directives, then examining the specific documentation or code assigned to that subtask. For CheckTestSpec, that means reviewing test entries in docs/tests.md against testSpec.md directives. The test entries themselves don't violate the JSX comment requirement—they properly describe what tests should exercise each element. The actual violation is in the code lacking those comments. So I should flag this as a testSpec.md directive violation found in the DashboardPage components. I see the issue now—the JSX comments directive is split between two different checks. The testSpec.md directive has two parts: one about ensuring every interactive element is tested (which belongs in CheckTestSpec), and another about adding JSX comments (which actually belongs in CheckComponents since it's about the component code itself). So I should flag the JSX comments violation in CheckComponents and add a fix task for it. I'm checking the three component files and confirming none of them have JSX comments labeling the interactive elements with their corresponding test titles—that's definitely a violation I need to flag with a fix task. Now I'm reviewing the writeApp.md directives again to make sure I haven't missed anything else, starting with the requirements around test coverage, visual mockups, and data-testid attributes. The main issue I'm seeing is the missing JSX comments next to interactive elements—everything else checks out. For writeApp.md specifically, there don't appear to be any violations, so I'll clarify that the JSX comment requirement comes from testSpec.md and add a fix task to address

Assert side effect happens exactly once.**\n\n\n4. **Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings.** Prefer `getByTestId` for precise targeting.\n5. **All `data-testid` values must be consistent across test files.**\n6. **When test spec describes file upload, exercise actual file upload mechanics.**\n7. **NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait inside `.toPass()` retry block.**\n8. **Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks.**\n9. **Use generous timeouts for backend round-trips.**\n10. **For multi-step flows, add `test.slow()`.**\n11. **Always use** — the directive appears to be incomplete, so I need to see what comes next to understand the full requirement.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test files to verify they follow these directives. Looking at dashboard-quick-actions.spec.ts, I'm checking that navigation targets are precise and side effects are verified exactly once. The \"Create Order via Dialog\" test should verify that the OrderHistory creation entry appears only once, and I'm partway through examining that assertion.\n\nContinuing through the directives: the tests use `getByTestId` consistently rather than `getByText()` with common words, there are no `.toPass()` blocks, and the beforeEach setup is clean without unnecessary state cleanup. For backend operations, I'm verifying that timeouts are generous enough to handle round-trips.\n\nNow I'm checking that multi-step flows use `test.slow()` appropriately and that the data-testid values in the tests actually match what's in the markup—spot-checking a few key identifiers like `quick-actions-heading`, `quick-action-add-supplier`, and `add-supplier-modal` to ensure they're consistent.\n\nI'm also verifying that the \"Create Supplier\" and \"Create Order\" tests exercise all the exact fields specified in the requirements, and that test titles match their entry titles precisely.\n\nMoving on to the dashboard-upcoming-orders spec file now... Now I'm verifying the remaining test IDs match their actual implementations in the components, particularly checking what the FilterSelect component generates for its trigger element.","signature":"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

The FilterSelect component uses the `testId` prop to generate testids with the pattern:\n- Container: `${testId}`\n- Trigger: `${testId}-trigger`\n- Dropdown: `${testId}-dropdown`\n- Search: `${testId}-search`\n- Option: `${testId}-option-${option.value}`\n\nSo for the upcoming orders status filter (testId=\"upcoming-orders-status-filter\"):\n- `upcoming-orders-status-filter-trigger` ✅- `upcoming-orders-status-filter-dropdown` ✅\n- `upcoming-orders-status-filter-option-Pending` → option value is \"Pending\", so `upcoming-orders-status-filter-option-Pending` ✅\n\n\n- `upcoming-orders-status-filter-option-` for the \"All Statuses\" option with an empty value ✅\n\nAnd for the supplier filter (testId=\"upcoming-orders-supplier-filter\"), I'm verifying the same pattern applies: the trigger, dropdown, and individual option testids for \"Techcom Solutions\" and the \"All Suppliers\" catch-all with an empty value all follow the expected naming convention ✅\n\nNow I'm doing a systematic check across all three test files to ensure testids are used consistently where they should be. The `dashboard-page` testid appears in the setup for all three files, while the filter-specific testids are isolated to their respective specs. I'm also noticing that `suppliers-grid` is referenced in both the quick-actions and suppliers-list specs with the same testid, and the `supplier-card-` prefix is used consistently across multiple test files ✅\n\n.\n\nMoving into the dashboard-suppliers-list spec, I'm verifying that the navigation test properly extracts the supplier ID from the testid and confirms the URL matches the expected supplier details route with a 30-second timeout. The test avoids generic text selectors and sticks with testid-based queries, and the setup is minimal without unnecessary state cleanup. The timeout values are generous throughout.\n\nNow I'm cross-referencing all the testid values against the actual SuppliersList component markup to ensure they match exactly—checking that `suppliers-list`, `suppliers-grid`, `supplier-card-*`, and the various card property identifiers like `supplier-name-*`, `supplier-status-*`, `supplier-contact-*`, and `supplier-email-*` all correspond to their actual data-testid attributes in the source file.\n\nI've also verified that the test for \"Supplier Card Shows All Fields Together\" covers all the required fields from the

[2026-02-27T06:00:25.103Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_019EaCyYeE8FSDgf1AVorFHN","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me check the Playwright config against writeTests.md directives:- `fullyParallel: true` ✅ (directive: \"The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`\")\n- `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` ✅ (directive: \"must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\")\n- `timeout: 60000` ✅ (directive: \"global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms\")\n- `webServer.timeout: 60000` ✅\n\n\n- `webServer.command` is configured with the netlify dev server and functions directory as required ✅\n- No `workers: 1` setting, which is correct ✅\n\nNow checking the \"Parallel Test Design\" directives: the \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\" test uses relative assertions by counting initial cards and verifying the count remains unchanged, which properly avoids relying on a fixed total record count.\n\nThe \"Create Order Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Order\" test follows the same pattern with rows. The \"Display Supplier Cards in Grid Layout\" test uses `expect(count).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(8)` for a relative assertion. The \"Multiple Supplier Cards Displayed\" test checks for specific named suppliers with expected counts and a total of at least 8, which is valid since it's checking by name rather than absolute totals.\n\nFor the \"Never hardcode database IDs in tests\" directive, the tests use testids derived from `order_id` rather than hardcoded values.\n\nNow I'm checking the \"Filter by Supplier Dropdown\" test which references an order ID from the SupplierDetailsPage section. I need to verify whether the dashboard displays all orders or just a subset, since this test assumes those specific orders appear in the Upcoming Orders table.\n\nLooking at the DashboardPage implementation, it fetches all orders and passes them to the UpcomingOrdersTable, so supplier-specific orders like PO-78901 should indeed be visible in the dashboard. That checks out.\n\nI'm also verifying that backend-dependent assertions use the 30-second timeout consistently, and that multi-step tests have the slow marker applied. The testid naming conventions are also consistent across files with the `supplier-card-` prefix being used throughout.\n\nNow I'm checking that each test actually exercises the fields described in the spec—the Create Supplier test covers all six fields including the default Active status, and the Purchase Order test exercises the supplier selection, delivery date, and line item details with the order date defaulting to today as expected.\n\nFor navigation tests, I'm verifying that clicks land on the correct URLs and pages—the Order ID links assert the proper purchase order URL pattern, the Supplier Card click confirms navigation to the supplier details page, and the Create Order dialog test checks that the order details page appears after submission.\n\nI'm also scanning for any `.toPass()` blocks and reviewing the styled link test at line 84-104 which validates the clickable appearance through computed styles.\n\nChecking the test files for `getByText()` usage—none found across the quick-actions, upcoming-orders, or suppliers-list specs, which is good since they're all using `getByTestId` instead. And for the `.first()` workaround in the suppliers-list spec at line 36, that's actually intentional filtering for the two \"Apex Logistics\" cards that legitimately exist in the seed data, not a selector ambiguity issue.\n\nThe cancel and validation tests are solid too—they're verifying actual data state changes rather than just checking that modals close, and the error message assertions confirm the modals stay open when validation fails. Now I'm checking whether the beforeEach hooks have any unnecessary cleanup like `localStorage.removeItem` or `page.reload()` that shouldn't be there given Playwright's fresh context per test.","signature":"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
