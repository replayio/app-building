[2026-02-26T08:22:42.014Z] Running task: 3 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md)
[2026-02-26T08:22:42.014Z]   - FixViolationMissingModalCancelRunDetails: Fix testSpec.md - Add test entry for AdjustQuantityModal cancel/dismiss, add data-testid to modal Cancel and X buttons in RunActions.tsx, and write test for modal dismiss
[2026-02-26T08:22:42.014Z]   - FixViolationMissingCalendarVerification: Fix writeTests.md - RUN-ACT-4 and RUN-ACT-6 tests must verify the CalendarPage shows the updated run status (Confirmed/Cancelled), not just use it as a navigation waypoint
[2026-02-26T08:22:42.014Z]   - RunTests: Verify tests pass after fixes

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium.

Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n   314→  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n   315→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   316→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   317→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   318→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   319→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   320→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   321→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   322→- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n   323→  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n   324→  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n   325→- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n   326→  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n   327→  cold start latency.\n   328→- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   329→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   330→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   331→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n   332→  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n   333→  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n   334→- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n   335→  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n   336→  prevent with a quick source check.\n   337→- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n   338→  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n   339→  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n   340→  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n   341→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"93f96e81-2525-4f4d-a9b7-d27abbbffaac","uuid":"1ad1ba74-93b1-4587-9a07-657aa2c97859","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/testing.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial testing task into a single task:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testing.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a task to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testing.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}

Let me understand the three subtasks:\n\n### Subtask 1: FixViolationMissingModalCancelRunDetails\nThe testSpec.md has a directive that says \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\" The AdjustQuantityModal currently has no test entry for dismissing/cancelling the modal. The existing tests only cover opening the modal and saving changes (RUN-ACT-2), but not dismissing/cancelling it.\n\nI need to:\n1. Add a test entry in docs/tests.md for AdjustQuantityModal cancel/dismiss \n\n\n2. Add data-testid attributes to the Cancel and X buttons in RunActions.tsx so they're selectable in tests\n3. Write a test that verifies the modal dismisses properly when either button is clicked\n\n### Subtask 2: FixViolationMissingCalendarVerification\nThe test spec entries RUN-ACT-4 and RUN-ACT-6 say:\n- RUN-ACT-4: \"And the run appears as 'Confirmed' on the CalendarPage\"\n- RUN-ACT-6: \"And the run appears as 'Cancelled' on the CalendarPage\"\n\nBut the current tests (RUN-ACT-4 and RUN-ACT-6) only navigate to the calendar without actually verifying the run status appears there.\n\nI need to update these tests to assert that the CalendarPage displays the updated status, not just navigate to it and back.\n\n### Subtask 3: Run tests to verify everything passes.\n\nStarting with subtask 1. I'll add a new test entry to docs/tests.md for the AdjustQuantityModal cancel/dismiss behavior — something like RUN-ACT-10 since the existing entries don't cover this scenario. Then I need to add data-testid attributes to the modal buttons so they're accessible in the test.\n\nNow I should examine the CalendarPage to understand how runs are displayed there, so I can properly verify the status updates in the calendar view for both RUN-ACT-4 and RUN-ACT-6.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1408,"cache_read_input_tokens":58681,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1408,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"93f96e81-2525-4f4d-a9b7-d27abbbffaac","uuid":"c4506d60-7fdf-4b7a-b99d-68a47ba161b5"}

The test creates runs with dates in September 2024, but the calendar defaults to the current date (February 2026). So the test would need to navigate to September 2024 to see those events.\n\nThis is problematic. The existing persistence checks just do `page.goto(\"/calendar\")` as a waypoint to navigate away and back. They don't actually verify anything on the calendar.\n\nI need to think about how to handle this. Options:\n1. Navigate to the correct month on the calendar (September 2024) before checking - this is fragile and slow\n2. Use a date closer to \"today\" when creating the test run - but this might collide with the default calendar view\n\n\n3. Actually, the RUN-ACT-4 and RUN-ACT-6 tests each create their own dedicated runs, so I can just update those test runs to use dates closer to today instead of the hardcoded 2024 dates. I should update the run creation to use today's date so it shows up in the default calendar view, but I need to check if changing those dates would break other parts of the tests first. Looking at RUN-ACT-4, it only uses the run to verify status changes, so the specific dates shouldn't matter for the test logic.\n\nThe challenge is that \"today's date\" is dynamic, but I can use JavaScript's `new Date().toISOString()` in the test setup since Playwright tests run in a JavaScript environment. However, there's another consideration—the calendar events have specific test IDs based on the run ID, so even if the calendar is showing the wrong month, the element won't render at all. Let me explore a different approach instead.\n\nRather than navigating through the calendar to find the event, I could either navigate directly to the correct month using the URL, or more simply, just update the run creation to use today's date so it's guaranteed to appear in the calendar's current view. The latter is cleaner. I'll modify the test runs in RUN-ACT-4 and RUN-ACT-6 to use today's date computed inline.\n\nThe key thing I need to verify is that when the calendar loads, it shows the current month by default, so a run created with today's date will definitely be visible.\n\nNow I'm updating the tests to compute the ISO date strings for today dynamically within each test, ensuring consistency across the test run.","signature":"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

But also, the CalendarPage only shows runs for the current month. The calendar might also filter by status. Let me check - the statusFilter defaults to \"All\" which shows all runs, so that's fine.\n\nBut there's another issue: will the calendar event for a Cancelled run be hidden by the status filter? The getEventClass function handles \"Cancelled\" status, so it should display. And with statusFilter=\"All\", all runs are shown.\n\nOne more concern: the calendar shows the monthly view. \n\nSo if I create a run with today's date, the CalendarGrid should render it since it generates cells for each day of the month, retrieves runs for that day, and renders each one as a calendar event element. The event should be visible as long as the run falls within the current month being displayed.\n\nThe status filtering shouldn't be an issue either—whether the run is Confirmed or Cancelled, both get rendered on the calendar since the default filter is \"All\" and the event rendering doesn't exclude any statuses. Now I should verify my test changes are correct before running them.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":525,"cache_read_input_tokens":75868,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":525,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"93f96e81-2525-4f4d-a9b7-d27abbbffaac","uuid":"f0c16737-e603-404a-9cf1-09d21961e484"}
