See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match.

The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"cc3748cb-bb7a-4df0-969c-cfdbe4c3a567","uuid":"30140008-3a82-48f0-b021-b95341149a6b","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

[2026-02-24T02:55:43.480Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01GmzkV2iU85C4ZJH9cZDcoT","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have the full picture. The SettingsPage section already exists in tests.md (starting at line 2460) with all four components: EmailNotificationsSection, ImportExportSection, WebhooksSection, and AddEditWebhookModal.\n\nLooking at the existing content carefully:\n\n1. **PlanPageSettingsPage** - The page section heading, component list, and subsection headings already exist. The job says \"Decide on components for SettingsPage, add sections to docs/tests.md\". It appears this has already been done - the structure exists with all components listed and all subsections have test entries.\n\n2. **PlanComponentSettingsEmailNotifications** - Test entries already exist (lines 2464-2523) covering: visibility when authenticated/not authenticated, seven toggles displayed, individual toggle tests, toggle back on, multiple toggles independent.\n\n\n3. **PlanComponentSettingsImportExport** - Test entries already exist (lines 2525-2584) covering: display of buttons, import dialog for each entity type, export buttons for each entity type, CSV validation, template download, cancel button.\n\n4. **PlanComponentSettingsWebhooks** - Test entries already exist (lines 2586-2694) covering: webhook list display, add/edit/delete, enable/disable toggle, event types, modal fields, platform guides, payload preview, validation, creating/editing webhooks, cancel/overlay close.\n\nLet me re-examine the job descriptions more carefully to see what actually needs to be done versus what's already complete.\n\nLooking at the git history to understand what's been implemented... I'm noticing a mismatch between the job description and the existing specs—the requirements mention Discord as a webhook platform, but the current setup guides only reference Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. I need to reconcile this discrepancy and ensure the test entries cover all three platforms that are actually specified in the job description. I'm noticing a discrepancy between what the job description says about Discord and what the AppRevisions actually document—the guides only mention Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Let me trace back through the git history to understand whether these test entries were already written in a previous attempt or if I'm starting fresh.\n\nLooking at the recent commits, the SettingsPage tests are already present in the file with all the required components and sections documented. I should verify each job requirement against what's actually there to determine if this is complete or needs additional work.\n\nChecking the existing tests: EmailNotificationsSection has all 7 toggleable preferences with visibility checks for authenticated vs non-authenticated users. ImportExportSection covers all four import buttons and three export buttons with CSV processing and validation. WebhooksSection includes the webhook list, enable/disable toggle, add/edit modal with name/URL/events, and platform guides for Zapier, n8n, and Custom—though the job mentions Discord specifically, the implementation uses Custom instead. All the core functionality appears to be tested and documented. There's a tension between what the job description specifies (Discord) and what the existing setup guides section documents (custom endpoints). The webhooks section clearly lists Discord as a target, but the setup guides are more generic. I think the right approach is to add a Discord-specific setup guide rather than keeping it as a generic custom option, since Discord is explicitly called out in the requirements. The directive is explicit—generic Custom options don't meet the requirement for service-specific setup instructions. So I need to add a Discord-specific platform guide test to the existing Zapier and n8n tests. Looking at the spec more broadly, I should also verify what other elements are missing from the Settings page tests, like the Email Notifications toggles, Import & Export buttons, and Webhooks CRUD operations.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the existing test coverage against the spec. For the Email Notifications section, I have the visibility checks and toggle persistence covered, but I'm wondering if there are gaps around loading states or error handling when preferences fail to fetch. For Import & Export, the tests cover the dialog flows and CSV validation, but I should double-check whether the actual import and export operations themselves are being tested.\n\nLooking at the Webhooks section, I've got the CRUD operations and event type display covered, but I'm missing a Discord platform guide. The modal tests cover the name, URL, platform, and event fields along with the Zapier and n8n guides, plus validation and success states, though I should add the Discord guide there too.\n\nThe spec explicitly calls out Discord as a supported service alongside Zapier and n8n, and the directive requires platform-specific instructions for each one. So I need to add a test for the Discord setup guide in the modal.\n\nNow I'm weighing whether to keep a Custom option too—the Webhook Setup Guides section mentions \"custom endpoints,\" but that seems to conflict with the explicit list of three services. I think the right interpretation is to support all four: Zapier, n8n, Discord, and Custom, treating \"custom endpoints\" as an additional fallback option rather than a replacement for Discord.\n\nLooking at the existing test around line 2634, it currently lists only Zapier, n8n, and Custom as platform options, so I need to add Discord to that list. There's also a test for the Custom endpoint setup guide that I should keep, but I'll need to add a corresponding test for Discord as well. Looking at the existing tests, I'm realizing they already cover the core requirements pretty comprehensively—all the individual toggles, visibility conditions, import/export buttons, and validation scenarios are accounted for. What I should focus on is whether there are any gaps in the webhook section, particularly around the Discord platform guide that needs to be added alongside the existing Zapier, n8n, and Custom platform tests. that the spec and job description both mention Discord, I should add it as a fourth platform option alongside Zapier, n8n, and Custom. I'll need to update the platform options, add a Discord setup guide test, and update the URL placeholder test to include Discord. Now I'm mapping out the specific edits needed across the file—updating the platform options list to include Discord, inserting the Discord setup guide after the n8n section, adding Discord to the platform cycling logic, and updating the URL placeholder to reflect Discord's format

The name is prominent and clearly readable.\n\n#### Table rows display contact title\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with contacts that have titles (e.g., \"VP of Sales\", \"CTO\", \"Marketing Director\").\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the contact's title/role in the Title column (e.g., \"VP of Sales\", \"CTO\", \"Marketing Director\"). Contacts without a title show an empty cell or placeholder.\n\n#### Table rows display contact email\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with contacts that have email addresses.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the contact's email address in the Email column (e.g., \"sarah@acme.com\").

Each row navigates to the correct individual's detail page based on their id.\n\n#### Pagination controls appear when contacts exceed page size\n- **Initial state:** The system has more than 50 contacts (e.g., 120 contacts).\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are displayed below the contacts table. The controls include a \"Previous\" button, numbered page buttons (e.g., 1, 2, 3), and a \"Next\" button. A text indicator shows \"Showing 1-50 of 120 contacts\". Each page shows up to 50 contacts. The current page number (1) is visually highlighted/selected.\n\n#### Clicking Next loads the next page of contacts\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with pagination controls visible. User is on page 1.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Next\" button.\n- **Expected:** The contacts table updates to show the next page of contacts (contacts 51–100).

User is on page 1.\n- **Action:** User clicks page number \"3\".\n- **Expected:** The contacts table updates to show page 3 of contacts (contacts 101–120).

Both \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons reflect correct enabled/disabled state.\n\n#### Previous button is disabled on first page\n- **Initial state:** User is on page 1 of the contacts list.\n- **Expected:** The \"Previous\" button is disabled (visually grayed out and not clickable). The \"Next\" button is enabled. Page number 1 is highlighted.\n\n#### Next button is disabled on last page\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to the last page of contacts (e.g., page 3 of 120 contacts with 50 per page).\n- **Expected:** The \"Next\" button is disabled (visually grayed out and not clickable). The \"Previous\" button is enabled. The last page number is highlighted. The text indicator shows the remaining contacts (e.g., \"Showing 101-120 of 120 contacts\").\n\n#### Pagination updates when search reduces result count\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage shows 120 contacts with 3 pages of pagination.\n- **Action:** User types a search term that returns only 30 contacts.\n- **Expected:** The pagination controls update to reflect the filtered count. The text indicator shows \"Showing 1-30 of 30 contacts\". Since all results fit on one page, the \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons are both disabled and page numbers show only page 1.\n\n#### Pagination hidden when all results fit on one page\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with fewer than 50 contacts (or search results return fewer than 50).\n- **Expected:** The pagination controls are either hidden or show a single page with no Previous/Next navigation needed.

Instead, the search waits for the user to stop typing (debounce delay, e.g., 300ms) before filtering the table. This prevents excessive API calls or re-renders during rapid typing. After the debounce delay, the table updates to show contacts matching \"Sar\".\n\n#### Search input clears and shows all contacts\n- **Initial state:** The search input contains \"Sarah\" and only matching contacts are shown.\n- **Action:** User clears the search input (selects all text and deletes, or clicks a clear button if present).\n- **Expected:** All contacts are displayed again without any filter applied.

Client Name is optional and performs a lookup by name against existing clients to create the association. A \"Download CSV template\" button is available. A file upload area or file picker is present for selecting a CSV file.\n\n#### ImportDialog CSV format specification is visible before upload\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog for contacts is open.\n- **Expected:** The CSV column format specification table is immediately visible to the user before they attempt any upload.

The URL input placeholder updates to reflect the n8n URL format.\n\n#### Platform selection shows Discord setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Discord\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A platform-specific setup guide is displayed with step-by-step instructions for obtaining the Discord webhook URL. The guide explains where to find the webhook URL in Discord (e.g., \"Go to Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks, click 'New Webhook', select the target channel, and copy the webhook URL\"). A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...\"). A platform-specific tip is displayed explaining that Discord webhooks accept a JSON payload and may require an embeds array structure for rich message formatting. The URL input placeholder updates to reflect the Discord URL format.\n\n#### Platform selection shows Custom endpoint setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Custom\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A setup guide is displayed with instructions for configuring a custom webhook endpoint. The guide explains that the endpoint must accept POST requests with a JSON payload. A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://your-server.com/webhook\"). The URL input placeholder updates to a generic webhook URL format.\n\n#### Payload format preview is toggleable\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with a platform selected.\n- **Action:** User clicks a toggle or expandable section to show the payload format preview.\n- **Expected:** A section expands or appears showing the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The preview displays example JSON with fields like event type, timestamp, and entity data. The user can toggle this section closed again to hide the preview.\n\n#### Event checkboxes allow selecting multiple events\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open. No events are selected.\n- **Action:** User checks the \"New Client Created\" and \"Deal Stage Changed\" event checkboxes.\n- **Expected:** Both checkboxes are visually checked. The user can check or uncheck any combination of event types independently. At least one event must be selected to save the webhook.\n\n#### Modal validates required fields\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with all fields empty.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Save\" button without filling in any fields.\n- **Expected:** Validation errors are displayed for required fields: Name is required, URL is required, and at least one event must be selected. The webhook is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### Modal validates URL format\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open. User has entered a name and selected events.\n- **Action:** User enters \"not-a-valid-url\" in the URL field and clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** A validation error is displayed indicating the URL is not valid (e.g., \"Please enter a valid URL\"). The webhook is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### Successfully creating a webhook adds it to the list\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User fills in Name = \"My Zapier Hook\", selects platform = \"Zapier\", enters URL = \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123/abc\", checks \"New Client Created\" and \"Task Completed\" events, and clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** The webhook is created via the CRUD API. The modal closes. The new webhook \"My Zapier Hook\" appears in the webhooks list with the URL displayed, an enabled toggle, and the selected event types shown.\n\n#### Successfully editing a webhook updates the list\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open in edit mode for a webhook named \"My Zapier Hook\" subscribed to \"New Client Created\" and \"Task Completed\".\n- **Action:** User changes the name to \"Updated Zapier Hook\" and additionally checks the \"Deal Stage Changed\" event. User clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** The webhook is updated via the API. The modal closes. The webhook list shows the updated name \"Updated Zapier Hook\" and now displays three subscribed events: \"New Client Created\", \"Task Completed\", and \"Deal Stage Changed\".\n\n#### Cancel button closes modal without saving\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with some fields filled in.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No webhook is created or updated. The webhooks list remains unchanged.\n\n#### Modal closes on overlay click without saving\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the modal overlay (area outside the modal dialog).\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No webhook is created or updated.\n\n#### URL placeholder updates based on selected platform\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with no platform selected.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Zapier\", then \"n8n\", then \"Discord\", then \"Custom\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** When \"Zapier\" is selected, the URL input placeholder shows a Zapier-style URL hint (e.g., \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/...\"). When \"n8n\" is selected, the placeholder changes to an n8n-style URL hint (e.g., \"https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...\"). When \"Discord\" is selected, the placeholder changes to a Discord-style URL hint (e.g., \"https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...\"). When \"Custom\" is selected, the placeholder changes to a generic URL hint (e.g., \"https://your-server.com/webhook\").\n\n## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n\nComponents: UsersGrid, UserCard\n\n### UsersGrid\n\n#### Page displays heading \"Team\"\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /users.\n- **Expected:** The page displays a heading \"Team\" at the top. The sidebar \"Team\" link is highlighted as active.","numLines":80,"startLine":2630,"totalLines":2945}}}
