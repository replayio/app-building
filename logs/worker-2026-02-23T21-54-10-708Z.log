Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f590a3e2-1b2f-453c-9b4e-e480fa9f26d5","uuid":"a83cde7e-8e84-430f-89c6-6ea1e1f243b3","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

The outer container (`.ezxFuW`) is a single-column grid where each child is a full-width row.\n\n```css\n/* Outer list container */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* single column, full-width rows */\ngrid-template-rows: 36px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 308px;\n                  /* ^group header  ^issue rows...                              ^spacer */\n```\n\n- **Group header row**: 36px tall\n- **Issue row**: 44px tall\n- The list container has 14 children: 1 group header + 12 issue rows + 1 spacer\n\n### Issue Row Structure\n\nEach issue row is an `<a>` tag (the full row is clickable) wrapping an inner grid `<div>` with **7 named grid columns**:\n\n| Column       | Content Example          | Font Size | Font Weight | Color             |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `checkbox`   | (empty/checkbox)         | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `priority`   | (priority icon)          | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `identifier` | \"PRO-1247\", \"TT-38\"     | 13px      | 450         | rgb(91, 91, 93)   |\n| `status`     | (status icon)            | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `title`      | \"Contact form not working\" | 13px    | 500         | rgb(26, 26, 26)   |\n| `created`    | (date/avatar info)       | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n| (additional) | (assignee, labels, etc.) | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n\nKey observations:\n- **Identifier** uses muted color `rgb(91, 91, 93)` / `#5b5b5d` with semi-bold weight 450\n- **Title** uses primary color `rgb(26, 26, 26)` / `#1a1a1a` with medium weight 500\n- Both use 13px font size (not the body 16px)\n- The grid uses **named column tracks** (`checkbox`, `priority`, `identifier`, `status`, `title`, `created`) for semantic column placement\n\n### Issue Row Styling\n\n```css\n/* Issue row (A tag) */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-column: 1 / -1;      /* spans full width */\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 44px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nborder: none;              /* 0px none — no visible row borders */\ncursor: default;\ntext-decoration: none;     /* no underline on the link */\noutline: none;             /* focus-visible override */\n```\n\n### Row Separation\n\nRows have **no visible borders** between them. Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nfont-size: 16px;\nfont-weight: 400;\n```\n\nGroup headers contain section names (e.g., \"Other active\") with a count badge (\"19\").\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —         |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`  | ~6% black |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(239, 239, 239)`     | `#efefef` |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(245, 245, 245)`     | `#f5f5f5` |\n| Alt hover (mid)   | `rgb(247, 247, 247)`     | `#f7f7f7` |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(237, 237, 237)`     | `#ededed` |\n\nAll hover backgrounds observed in stylesheets:\n- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)` — primary interactive hover\n- `rgb(239, 239, 239)` — pressed/active\n- `rgb(245, 245, 245)` — sidebar hover\n- `rgb(247, 247, 247)` — light hover\n- `rgb(237, 237, 237)` — selected state\n- `transparent` — reset/clear hover\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: var(--control-border-radius, 4px);\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(45, 46, 47);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background         | Description                |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Default | transparent        | No background              |\n| Hover   | rgb(247, 247, 247) | `#f7f7f7` — subtle gray    |\n| Active  | rgb(238, 238, 238) | `#eeeeee` — slightly darker|\n\nThe hover transition uses `var(--speed-highlightFadeIn)` for a fast, smooth appearance.\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n| `1px solid var(--gray4)`             | Subtle separators        |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#dcdcdc`.\nHover border uses `var(--normal-border-hover)` and `var(--gray5)` for a slightly darker state.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value                              | Usage                     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| `var(--control-border-radius)` 4px | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px                                | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px                                | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%                                | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows are very subtle and use low-opacity black.

I need to unpack the \"Write the app\" job into sub-groups. \n\nAccording to the strategy:\n1. First, add a setup group (SetupApp + DesignDatabase)\n2. Then add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself\n\nLet me identify all pages and their components from the spec:\n\n**Pages:**\n1. ClientsListPage (/clients)\n   - Sidebar (shared)\n   - ClientsSearchAndFilters\n   - ClientsActions\n   - ClientsTable\n   - Pagination\n\n2. ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n   - ClientHeader\n   - QuickActions\n   - SourceInfoSection\n   - TasksSection\n   - DealsSection\n   - AttachmentsSection\n   - PeopleSection\n   - TimelineSection\n\n3.

DealsListPage (/deals)\n   - DealsSummaryCards\n   - DealsViewTabs\n   - DealsFilters\n   - DealsTable\n   - CreateDealButton\n   - Pagination\n\n5. DealDetailPage (/deals) - still mapping out the remaining pages and their component structures. I'm realizing Pagination gets reused across multiple pages, so I should probably extract it as its own shared component rather than duplicating it in each group.\n\nNow I need to think about the order—ClientsListPage is first, so I'll start building the commands there, beginning with the setup group and then tackling one page group at a time.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1431,"cache_read_input_tokens":41702,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1431,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f590a3e2-1b2f-453c-9b4e-e480fa9f26d5","uuid":"3f190891-adb3-4e9f-8c8a-5377214950ea"}
