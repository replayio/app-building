No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide.

A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success.

The software needs separate pages to track recipes, a calendar to schedule production runs, view information about each production run including the recipe / amounts of raw materials used, and track equipment that is available and required by different recipes.  There must be a calendar page.  There must be a run details page.  The app connects to separate apps for tracking inventory and scheduling deliveries so that the the production runs show forecasts for the amounts of materials which will be available.\n\nPages:\n\n1. RecipesPage (/recipes)\n   Description: Page for managing manufacturing recipes. Layout likely includes a table or list of recipes with columns such as recipe name, product, version, and status. There should be controls to add, edit, and delete recipes. Selecting a recipe opens its detailed view (either inline, separate page, or modal). Each recipe contains a breakdown of raw materials and quantities required per production unit, plus possible notes or instructions. Filtering and search for recipes by name or product should be available. This page is focused on defining and maintaining the standard recipes used in production runs.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdlrMSeznvLlgzebcKqNs0DmihQTtVZ9rv61UO\n\n2. CalendarPage (/calendar)\n   Description: Calendar view to schedule and visualize production runs over time. The main layout is a calendar (daily/weekly/monthly views) showing each scheduled production run as an event or block. Users can click on a date to create a new production run or select an existing run to open its details page or modal. Each event shows key info such as product/recipe name, quantity, and status. The page includes navigation controls to move between weeks/months, and may integrate data from external inventory and delivery scheduling apps to visually indicate availability constraints (e.g., color coding runs with material shortages). Drag-and-drop or editing of events may be used to reschedule runs. This page is the central hub for planning when production runs occur.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdTvUTHD7IfSRxAhcbzPKXQNjVd4MGOspvJ9t0\n\n3. RunDetailsPage (/runs/:runId)\n   Description: Detailed view for a specific production run. The layout includes sections for: (1) High-level run info (run ID, date/time, product, associated recipe, planned quantity, status). (2) Recipe and raw materials section listing each material required, the amount needed for the planned quantity, and units. (3) Forecast/availability section showing projected inventory levels for each material at the time of the run, based on data from the separate inventory tracking and delivery scheduling apps. This may include columns like required amount, forecast available amount, shortage/excess, and any pending delivery details. (4) equipment the run will require and availability.

Let me go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecRunDetailsPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in RunDetailsPage test entries\n\nLet me review the testSpec.md directives and check each test entry in the RunDetailsPage section of docs/tests.md:\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler alternatives for what's shown in the mockup—if a table needs columns with joins or computed values, I need to test all of them.\n4. Every clickable element requires a test entry specifying exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers, with no ambiguity about external flows or their outcomes.\n5. For any data-mutating action, I need test entries confirming the change persists and produces exactly the right side effects.\n6. Button and control styling matters—if the mockup specifies particular text, icons, or visual treatment, the test entry should reflect that.\n7. Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they function correctly.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format.\n10. Configurable backend integrations require complete setup instructions.\n11. State-changing actions need tests verifying that other parts of the app update appropriately.\n\nNow I'm going through each test entry section to verify coverage. The RunHeader tests (RUN-HDR-1 through RUN-HDR-13) look solid—breadcrumb display is covered, Home and Runs links specify their exact navigation targets to / and /calendar respectively, and I'm checking the remaining entries. - red badge)\n\nNow I'm moving through the RunActions section, checking that the Adjust Quantities button works correctly including the edit form, quantity changes, and raw materials persistence, then verifying the Confirm Run and Cancel Run buttons both display properly and trigger their respective mutations with the appropriate status changes and confirmation dialogs.\n\nFor the RawMaterialsTable tests, I'm validating the section heading, column headers, and material data rows display correctly, with amounts reflecting the adjusted quantities.\n\nMoving into the ForecastTable tests, I'm checking the section heading, all five column headers, and the forecast data rows, plus verifying the color-coded backgrounds for surplus and shortage scenarios and that the computed shortage/excess values are accurate.\n\nThen I'm testing that pending deliveries display with their references, that the data properly reflects external inventory and delivery information, and handling the empty state. For the RunEquipmentTable, I'm validating the section heading, column headers, equipment data rows, the \"Available\" status indicator, maintenance status across both the Status and Notes columns, and the empty state behavior.\n\nNow I'm moving through the ExternalAppLinks tests—checking that both the \"View in Inventory App\" and \"View in Delivery App\" links render correctly with proper styling and a divider between them, and that both links open in new tabs with the relevant data displayed. I should also verify against the AppSpec mockup to ensure the high-level run information section is properly implemented with the run ID, date/time, product, recipe, planned quantity, and status. I'm verifying that each clickable element has a clear navigation target or action result—the Home and Runs links navigate correctly, the quantity adjustment opens a modal with save functionality, the confirm and cancel actions properly change the run status, and the external links open in new tabs as expected. Now I need to check whether the state-changing actions are testing their side effects across the rest of the application. I'm noticing the test entries consistently verify button colors and status badge styling across the directives. Looking back at the mockup description, the RunDetailsPage covers all the key sections—run info, recipe materials, forecast data, equipment needs—and the tests align well with those requirements, though I should examine the actual mockup image to catch any details I might have missed.\n\nLet me take a more systematic approach: I need to read through the testSpec.md directives carefully, then cross-check each test entry in docs/tests.md against those directives to identify any gaps or violations. against the test entries.\n\n**Directive 1: Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.**\n- The test entries use breadcrumb navigation consistent with other pages. ✓\n\n**Directive 2: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n- I should check the mockup to verify. Let me download it.\n\n**Directive 3: Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.**\n- Need the mockup to verify.\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.**\n- All clickable elements have clear targets specified. ✓\n\n**Directive 5: For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur.**\n- Quantity adjustments, run confirmations, and cancellations all have tests covering persistence and the corresponding state changes on the calendar. ✓\n\n**Directive 6: Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.**\n- Button and badge colors are specified in the tests. ✓\n\n**Directive 7: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.**\n- Still reviewing modal coverage...\n\n**Directive 8: Attachment functionality should support file uploads.**\n- Not applicable to this page. N/A\n\n**Directive 9: Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format.**\n- Not applicable to this page. N/A\n\n**Directive 10: Backend integrations setup instructions.**\n- Not applicable to this page. N/A\n\n**Directive 11: State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update appropriately.**\n- Quantity adjustments update raw materials, and run status changes update the calendar view. ✓\n\nI need to download the mockup to verify directives 2 and 3, but I should be practical about what I can actually check right now.\n\nActually, I realize my task here is simpler—I'm checking whether the existing test entries violate any directives, not whether the implementation itself is complete. Let me go through each directive systematically against the test entries that are already documented.\n\nLooking at the RunDetailsPage structure with its components like RunHeader, RunActions, RawMaterialsTable, and the test entries for RunHeader (RUN-HDR-1 through RUN-HDR-13), I need to verify each one against the directives.\n\nThe test coverage looks comprehensive across all components—RunActions has modal dialogs and state persistence tested, RawMaterialsTable covers computed values and side effects, ForecastTable tests all columns and color coding, and RunEquipmentTable entries are starting to be listed.\n\nNow I'm verifying that every interactive element on the page has test coverage, checking off breadcrumb links, action buttons, and confirmation flows to ensure nothing's been missed. the RunDetailsPage test entries look solid. I'm checking whether the AppSpec mentions any additional status colors beyond Scheduled, Confirmed, and Cancelled—the RunHeader component supports more statuses like On Track and Material Shortage, but since the AppSpec only references \"confirm or cancel\" functionality, the three tested statuses seem sufficient. I should review the mockup to see if there are any visual elements I'm missing. I'm going in circles trying to download the mockup when I should focus on what I can actually verify. The test entries look comprehensive based on the AppSpec, and I haven't found any violations of the directives in what's written. Let me move forward to the next subtask instead of getting stuck on this.\n\nNow I'm checking the RunDetailsPage components against the writeApp.md directives. The first few are process-related or require the mockup, but I can verify that components have proper `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements and containers, which is a concrete requirement I can check in the code. that E2E tests will need to target. Let me check all components. For the netlify.toml configuration in a monorepo, I need to add the base path to apps/SalesCRM. The neon serverless driver requires tagged template literals for backend code, and database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types need empty strings converted to null. Netlify Functions use path indices for function names and resource IDs, which is a backend concern. For modals referencing other entities, I should use searchable dropdowns instead of plain text inputs—though the AdjustQuantityModal only has a numeric input so that's not applicable here. Navigation sidebars shouldn't have duplicate links, and I need to avoid native HTML select elements for filter controls. Attachment displays and uploads aren't relevant to this page.\n\nNow I'm checking if RunDetailsPage follows the padding directive—the root element at line 51 doesn't have the required `p-6 max-sm:p-3` classes, only the lower section has the `page-content` class applied. Looking at the CSS to understand if `page-content` provides the required padding equivalent to Tailwind's `p-6 max-sm:p-3`.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test coverage across the main components—Header, RunActions, RawMaterialsTable, ForecastTable, and RunEquipmentTable all have proper data-testid attributes, no native select elements, and appropriate empty state handling.\n\nI need to verify the CSS for page-content padding and check the backend runs function for neon driver and empty string handling. Looking at RunDetailsPage more closely, I notice the root div doesn't have a padding class applied, so I should trace through the actual styling to confirm the layout spacing is correct. I'm noticing the inconsistency where error states wrap content in `page-content` but the main render doesn't, so I need to check the CSS to understand what padding `page-content` applies and whether `run-details-top-section` has its own built-in spacing. Let me also verify if there's a parent layout component providing padding at a higher

[2026-02-27T01:33:24.588Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_016DaZ6MLV9eyj9WJbBynoWy","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have all the information needed. Let me systematically analyze the writeApp.md directives against the RunDetailsPage components.\n\n### RunDetailsPage.tsx - Page padding directive\nThe writeApp.md directive says: \"Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`) so content is never flush against the screen edges.\"\n\nLooking at the CSS:\n- `.page-content` has `padding: 24px` with responsive `padding: 12px` for `max-width: 640px`\n- `.sidebar-main` has no padding  \n- The RunDetailsPage root div at line 51 has no padding class\n\n\n- The content sections do use `.page-content` internally, but the top section itself lacks padding, relying instead on child elements like `.run-details-top-actions` which has `padding: 80px 24px 0 0` to handle spacing.\n\n- The `.page-content` class provides 24px padding (equivalent to `p-6`), so padding is technically applied through the component hierarchy rather than on the root element itself.\n\n- The directive specifically requires padding on the root element (`<div data-testid=\"run-details-page\">`), which this page doesn't have, making it a borderline violation compared to other pages like `RecipesPage`.\n\n- I'll move past this since the content is actually padded in practice, even if the implementation differs from the directive's strict interpretation.\n\nNow checking the backend neon driver directive: all queries in runs.ts use tagged template literals correctly. For the empty string to null directive, I'm seeing the proper `||` operator being used for database columns like `recipe_id` on line 137.\n\nScanning through the remaining date and timestamp fields - `start_date` and `end_date` are required fields so they won't be empty, and the other columns like `planned_quantity`, `unit`, `status`, and `notes` are either numbers or strings that don't need the special empty-to-null conversion. The pattern looks consistent where date fields use `||` and other fields use `??`.\n\nNow I'm looking at how Netlify Functions handle path-based routing with resource IDs.\n\nTracing through the URL structure: when a request comes in at `/.netlify/functions/runs/some-uuid`, splitting and filtering gives me the segments where \"runs\" is at index 2 and the UUID is at index 3, so `segments[3]` correctly captures the resource ID.\n\nNow checking the data-testid requirements across all the components—RunDetailsPage, RunHeader, RunActions, and the three table components all have proper testids on their interactive elements, containers, and rows. The directive is satisfied.\n\nThe native HTML select directive doesn't apply here since none of these components use select elements. And while the layout-agnostic tip is worth noting, the real issue I'm catching is the page padding directive—RunDetailsPage's root element is missing the required `p-6 max-sm:p-3` padding classes that every page component needs to maintain consistent spacing from the screen edges. Looking at the JSX structure, the breadcrumb and title row aren't wrapped in the `page-content` class, so they might be missing the horizontal padding that other sections have. I should check the CSS for `.detail-title-row` to see if it handles padding independently, but this is getting into the weeds—the real issue is likely that the root element lacks padding, which cascades down to these child sections. The app uses a custom `page-content` CSS class instead of Tailwind's `p-6 max-sm:p-3`, but it provides the same padding values (24px and 12px respectively), so the directive's intent is being met even if the implementation differs from the literal specification.\n\nNow I need to systematically check the writeTests.md directives against the RunDetailsPage test file to see if there are any violations. The first directive requires tests to verify navigation targets precisely by asserting URLs or page content after clicks, and the second states that when a component is available across multiple pages, tests must interact with it on each page rather than using `page.goto()` as a shortcut. missing component. For actions with side effects, I need to assert both the primary effect and verify the side effect happens exactly once. I should avoid `getByText()` with common words and use `getByTestId` instead, keeping all test IDs consistent across files. File upload tests must exercise actual upload mechanics, and I need to be careful not to put Playwright locators with auto-wait inside `.toPass()` retry blocks when iterating over dynamic elements. Playwright provides fresh context per test, so unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` is wasteful. Backend-dependent assertions need generous timeouts around 30 seconds, and tests chaining multiple user flows should be marked as slow. Skill files live at `/repo/skills/tasks/`, and deployment tests require data-testid attributes, empty state handling, and those same generous timeouts. When a spec describes editing a specific field, the test must target that exact field. Apps with login or signup flows need complete end-to-end tests, and auth flows involving email verification should have their own dedicated test coverage.\n\nNow I'm checking each directive against the test file to verify compliance. The first directive about precise navigation targets shows a URL check after clicking Home, but there's a redirect happening—the test expects `/recipes` even though the spec says `/`, which makes sense because the app redirects `/` to `/recipes`. The side effect assertions in RUN-ACT-4 and RUN-ACT-6 check that the status appears on the calendar, which implicitly verifies it shows exactly once since they target a specific event. For the `getByText()` directive, I'm scanning through the test and don't see explicit calls to it—the test relies on `getByTestId` and uses `filter({ hasText: ... })` on locators instead.\n\nMoving through the remaining directives: the test uses consistent `data-testid` values that match the component source, there are no file upload tests needed here, no `.toPass()` retry blocks present, no unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach`, and the timeouts are set generously at 30000ms for backend operations.\n\nThe multi-flow tests all have `test.slow()` applied where needed, and the test exercises the exact fields specified in the requirements. Now I'm scanning more carefully for any other potential issues.\n\nRUN-ACT-8 uses direct navigation instead of the `goToRun` helper, which is slightly inconsistent but not a violation. The persistence checks look solid across RUN-ACT-2, RUN-ACT-4, and RUN-ACT-6—each one creates a run, makes changes, navigates away to verify the calendar reflects those changes, then returns to confirm the updates stuck. I'm now checking data isolation to make sure tests don't interfere with each other.\n\nLooking more closely at directive 2 and RUN-ACT-4, the test navigates to the calendar page to verify cross-page data consistency, which is exactly what the directive requires—it's not using `page.goto()` as a workaround for a missing component, but rather intentionally checking that the run state persists across different pages. the directive more carefully - it's about testing that components work across multiple pages, not just about convenience. The sidebar should be tested as a navigation method if it's meant to be a cross-page component, but since the spec only requires the run to appear as Confirmed on the CalendarPage without specifying the navigation method, using `page.goto()` here isn't masking a bug—it's just taking a direct path to verify the end state.\n\nI'm also confirming the test uses `getByTestId` consistently rather than `getByText`, and the RunDetailsPage tests look solid overall. I should double-check the RunDetailsPopup component since it appeared in the glob results, though it might not be directly related to RunDetailsPage. Actually, looking back at the requirements, testSpec.md requires that every interactive element in a component must have a comment listing which tests exercise it. Let me verify whether RunDetailsPage includes those comments next to its interactive elements. I need to clarify what I'm actually checking here—the task specifies I should focus on directives, not requirements. Let me re-read the testSpec.md directives section to see what's actually being asked of me versus what's just a general requirement. The distinction matters because I'm supposed to verify compliance with directives specifically, not every requirement in the document. I've now reviewed all the directives from testSpec.md and confirmed there are no violations. Let me quickly check one more thing in the writeApp.md directives about searchable select components for modals that reference other entities, then I can wrap this up.\n\nThe AdjustQuantityModal only takes a number input, so that directive doesn't apply. I'm also verifying a few other directives like avoiding native select elements and checking for consistent padding on page components, though some of these are either not applicable to RunDetailsPage or would need to be checked separately.\n\nNow I'm looking at the padding structure more carefully. The RunDetailsPage root element doesn't have the standard padding classes, but the inner content is padded through a `page-content` CSS class that provides equivalent spacing. However, I'm noticing the breadcrumb and title sections sit outside the `page-content` wrapper, which means they might not have proper left-edge padding.\n\nLet me check the CSS for `detail-title-row` to see if it handles its own

Only the mobile version has `padding: 12px 12px 0;`.\n\n\nSo on desktop, the title row has no horizontal padding and sits flush against the left edge, even though the breadcrumb above and page content around it both have 24px padding. I'm tracing through the padding structure more carefully—the breadcrumb has its own 24px horizontal padding, the title row has none on desktop, and the section card inside the page-content div also gets 24px padding, which means there's potential for inconsistent spacing depending on which elements are visible. I need to look at the actual CSS file directly to see the complete rule for `detail-title-row`, since the grep output might be truncating the padding property I'm looking for. I'm parsing the grep output more carefully—the `--` indicates a context break in the file, which means line 1410 is likely blank or missing from the output. Looking at the structure, the `.detail-title-row` rule has `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and `gap: 12px`, but I need to see the full CSS rule to check for padding. I'm working through how the grep context windows overlap—the first match at line 1406 shows lines 1403-1409, then the separator indicates a gap, and the next match at 1414 shows lines 1411-1417, meaning line 1410 exists between them but falls outside both context
