Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly.

Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements.

When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt.

Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks.

EXISTING PAGE COMPONENTS & STRUCTURE\n\n**Example: MaterialsPage.tsx - Core Pattern**\n- **State Management**: Uses Redux (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`)\n- **Data Fetching**: `useEffect` dispatches async thunks (`fetchMaterials`, `fetchCategories`, `fetchAccounts`)\n- **Local State**: Manages pagination, filters, sorting, and modal state\n- **Filtering**: Search, category filter, account filter all work client-side\n- **Pagination**: Custom client-side pagination (8 items per page)\n- **Sorting**: Multiple sort options (name asc/desc, stock asc/desc, category asc)\n- **Modals**: Create/Edit modals for managing items\n- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicator while fetching\n- **Components Used**: \n  - `Breadcrumb` (from @shared)\n  - `FilterSelect` (from @shared)\n  - Custom components for table, pagination, search, sort\n\n**Example: AccountsPage.tsx - Alternative Pattern**\n- Groups accounts by type (Stock, Input, Output) using `useMemo`\n- Separate modals for Create and Edit operations\n- Confirmation dialog for destructive actions (archiving)\n- Uses `AccountsList` component for rendering grouped accounts\n\n---\n\n### 3. REDUX STORE SETUP\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/store.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { createAppStore } from \"@shared/store/store\";\nimport { authReducer } from \"@shared/auth/authSlice\";\n// Plus 6 app-specific reducers\n\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  reducer: {\n    auth: authReducer,\n    accounts: accountsReducer,\n    materials: materialsReducer,\n    batches: batchesReducer,\n    transactions: transactionsReducer,\n    dashboard: dashboardReducer,\n    categories: categoriesReducer,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**State Structure**:\n- Each domain (accounts, materials, batches, etc.) has its own slice\n- Common pattern: `items`, `currentItem`, `loading`, `error` state\n\n---\n\n### 4. REDUX SLICE PATTERNS\n\n**Pattern Example: accountsSlice.ts**\n\n```typescript\ninterface AccountsState {\n  items: Account[];\n  currentAccount: Account | null;\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n}\n\n// Async thunks for API calls:\nexport const fetchAccounts = createAsyncThunk(\n  \"accounts/fetchAccounts\",\n  async () => {\n    const res = await fetch(\"/.netlify/functions/accounts\");\n    if (!res.ok) throw new Error(\"Failed to fetch accounts\");\n    return (await res.json()) as Account[];\n  }\n);\n\n// Similar thunks: fetchAccountById, createAccount, updateAccount, archiveAccount\n\nconst accountsSlice = createSlice({\n  name: \"accounts\",\n  initialState,\n  reducers: {\n    clearCurrentAccount(state) {\n      state.currentAccount = null;\n    },\n  },\n  extraReducers: (builder) => {\n    // Handle pending/fulfilled/rejected states for each thunk\n    builder\n      .addCase(fetchAccounts.pending, (state) => {\n        if (state.items.length === 0) state.loading = true;\n        state.error = null;\n      })\n      .addCase(fetchAccounts.fulfilled, (state, action) => {\n        state.items = action.payload;\n        state.loading = false;\n      })\n      // ... reject case\n      .addCase(updateAccount.fulfilled, (state, action) => {\n        const idx = state.items.findIndex((a) => a.id === action.payload.id);\n        if (idx !== -1) state.items[idx] = action.payload;\n        if (state.currentAccount?.id === action.payload.id) {\n          state.currentAccount = action.payload;\n        }\n      });\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Key Patterns**:\n- **Async thunks** use `createAsyncThunk` for API calls\n- **API endpoint**: `/.netlify/functions/{functionName}`\n- **Query params**: Built using `URLSearchParams`\n- **Error handling**: Throws errors that Redux catches in rejected case\n- **Optimistic updates**: Items updated in both list and current item views\n- **Loading optimization**: Only shows loading if items are empty (not on refetch)\n\n---\n\n### 5. ROUTER SETUP (App.tsx)\n\n```typescript\nexport function App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <NavigationHeader />\n      <Routes>\n        <Route path=\"/\" element={<DashboardPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/accounts\" element={<AccountsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/accounts/:accountId\" element={<AccountDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/materials\" element={<MaterialsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/materials/:materialId\" element={<MaterialDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/batches\" element={<BatchesPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/batches/:batchId\" element={<BatchDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/transactions\" element={<TransactionsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/transactions/new\" element={<NewTransactionPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/transactions/:transactionId\" element={<TransactionDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/settings\" element={<SettingsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"*\" element={<Navigate to=\"/\" replace />} />\n      </Routes>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. NETLIFY FUNCTIONS (Backend API)\n\n**Base Pattern**: Each function handles GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for one resource\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/netlify/functions/accounts.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { neon } from \"@neondatabase/serverless\";\nimport type { Context } from \"@netlify/functions\";\n\nexport default async function handler(req: Request, _context: Context) {\n  const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;\n  if (!dbUrl) {\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"DATABASE_URL not set\" }), {\n      status: 500,\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    });\n  }\n\n  const sql = neon(dbUrl);\n  const url = new URL(req.url);\n  const segments = url.pathname.split(\"/\").filter(Boolean);\n  const accountId = segments[3] || null;\n\n  try {\n    if (req.method === \"GET\" && !accountId) {\n      // List all active accounts\n      const rows = await sql`SELECT ...`;\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows), {\n        status: 200,\n        headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (req.method === \"GET\" && accountId) {\n      // Get single account\n      const rows = await sql`SELECT ... WHERE id = ${accountId}`;\n      if (rows.length === 0) {\n        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Account not found\" }), {\n          status: 404,\n          headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n        });\n      }\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows[0]), { status: 200, ... });\n    }\n\n    if (req.method === \"POST\") {\n      const body = await req.json();\n      const { name, account_type, description } = body;\n      // Validate inputs\n      if (!name || !name.trim()) {\n        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"...\" }), {\n          status: 400,\n          headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n        });\n      }\n      // Insert and return\n      const rows = await sql`INSERT INTO accounts (...) VALUES (...) RETURNING ...`;\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows[0]), { status: 201, ... });\n    }\n\n    if (req.method === \"PUT\" && accountId) {\n      // Update account\n    }\n\n    if (req.method === \"DELETE\" && accountId) {\n      // Soft delete (archive)\n      const rows = await sql`UPDATE accounts SET status = 'archived' WHERE id = ${accountId} RETURNING id`;\n    }\n\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Method not allowed\" }), {\n      status: 405,\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    });\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(\"Accounts error:\", err);\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Internal server error\" }), {\n      status: 500,\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Key Patterns**:\n- Uses **Neon serverless PostgreSQL** via `@neondatabase/serverless`\n- **URL path parsing**: `segments[3]` for resource ID\n- **Query params**: Via `url.searchParams.get()`\n- **SQL templating**: Tagged template literals with `sql\\`...\\``\n- **Validation**: Before INSERT/UPDATE operations\n- **Error handling**: Try/catch with status codes (400, 404, 500)\n- **Soft deletes**: Status fields instead of DELETE\n\n**Available Functions**:\n1. `accounts.ts` - CRUD operations on accounts\n2. `materials.ts` - Material management with stock calculation\n3. `transactions.ts` - Complex transaction creation with transfers and batch creation\n4. `categories.ts` - Material categories\n5. `batches.ts` - Batch management\n6. `batch-usage.ts` - Batch usage history\n7. `account-materials.ts` - Materials within a specific account\n8. `dashboard.ts` - Dashboard summary data\n9. `material-distribution.ts` - Material distribution across accounts\n10. `dismiss-alert.ts` - Dismiss low inventory alerts\n\n---\n\n### 7.

EXISTING PAGE COMPONENTS & STRUCTURE\n\n**Example: MaterialsPage.tsx - Core Pattern**\n- **State Management**: Uses Redux (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`)\n- **Data Fetching**: `useEffect` dispatches async thunks (`fetchMaterials`, `fetchCategories`, `fetchAccounts`)\n- **Local State**: Manages pagination, filters, sorting, and modal state\n- **Filtering**: Search, category filter, account filter all work client-side\n- **Pagination**: Custom client-side pagination (8 items per page)\n- **Sorting**: Multiple sort options (name asc/desc, stock asc/desc, category asc)\n- **Modals**: Create/Edit modals for managing items\n- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicator while fetching\n- **Components Used**: \n  - `Breadcrumb` (from @shared)\n  - `FilterSelect` (from @shared)\n  - Custom components for table, pagination, search, sort\n\n**Example: AccountsPage.tsx - Alternative Pattern**\n- Groups accounts by type (Stock, Input, Output) using `useMemo`\n- Separate modals for Create and Edit operations\n- Confirmation dialog for destructive actions (archiving)\n- Uses `AccountsList` component for rendering grouped accounts\n\n---\n\n### 3. REDUX STORE SETUP\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/store.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { createAppStore } from \"@shared/store/store\";\nimport { authReducer } from \"@shared/auth/authSlice\";\n// Plus 6 app-specific reducers\n\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  reducer: {\n    auth: authReducer,\n    accounts: accountsReducer,\n    materials: materialsReducer,\n    batches: batchesReducer,\n    transactions: transactionsReducer,\n    dashboard: dashboardReducer,\n    categories: categoriesReducer,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**State Structure**:\n- Each domain (accounts, materials, batches, etc.) has its own slice\n- Common pattern: `items`, `currentItem`, `loading`, `error` state\n\n---\n\n### 4. REDUX SLICE PATTERNS\n\n**Pattern Example: accountsSlice.ts**\n\n```typescript\ninterface AccountsState {\n  items: Account[];\n  currentAccount: Account | null;\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n}\n\n// Async thunks for API calls:\nexport const fetchAccounts = createAsyncThunk(\n  \"accounts/fetchAccounts\",\n  async () => {\n    const res = await fetch(\"/.netlify/functions/accounts\");\n    if (!res.ok) throw new Error(\"Failed to fetch accounts\");\n    return (await res.json()) as Account[];\n  }\n);\n\n// Similar thunks: fetchAccountById, createAccount, updateAccount, archiveAccount\n\nconst accountsSlice = createSlice({\n  name: \"accounts\",\n  initialState,\n  reducers: {\n    clearCurrentAccount(state) {\n      state.currentAccount = null;\n    },\n  },\n  extraReducers: (builder) => {\n    // Handle pending/fulfilled/rejected states for each thunk\n    builder\n      .addCase(fetchAccounts.pending, (state) => {\n        if (state.items.length === 0) state.loading = true;\n        state.error = null;\n      })\n      .addCase(fetchAccounts.fulfilled, (state, action) => {\n        state.items = action.payload;\n        state.loading = false;\n      })\n      // ... reject case\n      .addCase(updateAccount.fulfilled, (state, action) => {\n        const idx = state.items.findIndex((a) => a.id === action.payload.id);\n        if (idx !== -1) state.items[idx] = action.payload;\n        if (state.currentAccount?.id === action.payload.id) {\n          state.currentAccount = action.payload;\n        }\n      });\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Key Patterns**:\n- **Async thunks** use `createAsyncThunk` for API calls\n- **API endpoint**: `/.netlify/functions/{functionName}`\n- **Query params**: Built using `URLSearchParams`\n- **Error handling**: Throws errors that Redux catches in rejected case\n- **Optimistic updates**: Items updated in both list and current item views\n- **Loading optimization**: Only shows loading if items are empty (not on refetch)\n\n---\n\n### 5. ROUTER SETUP (App.tsx)\n\n```typescript\nexport function App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <NavigationHeader />\n      <Routes>\n        <Route path=\"/\" element={<DashboardPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/accounts\" element={<AccountsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/accounts/:accountId\" element={<AccountDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/materials\" element={<MaterialsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/materials/:materialId\" element={<MaterialDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/batches\" element={<BatchesPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/batches/:batchId\" element={<BatchDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/transactions\" element={<TransactionsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/transactions/new\" element={<NewTransactionPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/transactions/:transactionId\" element={<TransactionDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/settings\" element={<SettingsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"*\" element={<Navigate to=\"/\" replace />} />\n      </Routes>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. NETLIFY FUNCTIONS (Backend API)\n\n**Base Pattern**: Each function handles GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for one resource\n\n**File**: `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/netlify/functions/accounts.ts`\n\n```typescript\nimport { neon } from \"@neondatabase/serverless\";\nimport type { Context } from \"@netlify/functions\";\n\nexport default async function handler(req: Request, _context: Context) {\n  const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;\n  if (!dbUrl) {\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"DATABASE_URL not set\" }), {\n      status: 500,\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    });\n  }\n\n  const sql = neon(dbUrl);\n  const url = new URL(req.url);\n  const segments = url.pathname.split(\"/\").filter(Boolean);\n  const accountId = segments[3] || null;\n\n  try {\n    if (req.method === \"GET\" && !accountId) {\n      // List all active accounts\n      const rows = await sql`SELECT ...`;\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows), {\n        status: 200,\n        headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (req.method === \"GET\" && accountId) {\n      // Get single account\n      const rows = await sql`SELECT ... WHERE id = ${accountId}`;\n      if (rows.length === 0) {\n        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Account not found\" }), {\n          status: 404,\n          headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n        });\n      }\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows[0]), { status: 200, ... });\n    }\n\n    if (req.method === \"POST\") {\n      const body = await req.json();\n      const { name, account_type, description } = body;\n      // Validate inputs\n      if (!name || !name.trim()) {\n        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"...\" }), {\n          status: 400,\n          headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n        });\n      }\n      // Insert and return\n      const rows = await sql`INSERT INTO accounts (...) VALUES (...) RETURNING ...`;\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows[0]), { status: 201, ... });\n    }\n\n    if (req.method === \"PUT\" && accountId) {\n      // Update account\n    }\n\n    if (req.method === \"DELETE\" && accountId) {\n      // Soft delete (archive)\n      const rows = await sql`UPDATE accounts SET status = 'archived' WHERE id = ${accountId} RETURNING id`;\n    }\n\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Method not allowed\" }), {\n      status: 405,\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    });\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(\"Accounts error:\", err);\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Internal server error\" }), {\n      status: 500,\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Key Patterns**:\n- Uses **Neon serverless PostgreSQL** via `@neondatabase/serverless`\n- **URL path parsing**: `segments[3]` for resource ID\n- **Query params**: Via `url.searchParams.get()`\n- **SQL templating**: Tagged template literals with `sql\\`...\\``\n- **Validation**: Before INSERT/UPDATE operations\n- **Error handling**: Try/catch with status codes (400, 404, 500)\n- **Soft deletes**: Status fields instead of DELETE\n\n**Available Functions**:\n1. `accounts.ts` - CRUD operations on accounts\n2. `materials.ts` - Material management with stock calculation\n3. `transactions.ts` - Complex transaction creation with transfers and batch creation\n4. `categories.ts` - Material categories\n5. `batches.ts` - Batch management\n6. `batch-usage.ts` - Batch usage history\n7. `account-materials.ts` - Materials within a specific account\n8. `dashboard.ts` - Dashboard summary data\n9. `material-distribution.ts` - Material distribution across accounts\n10. `dismiss-alert.ts` - Dismiss low inventory alerts\n\n---\n\n### 7.

[2026-02-26T13:29:58.509Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01FVeg3QWvepqUvofWhTo86A","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Looking at the mockup and the tests, here's what I need:\n\n1. **DateRangeFilter** - The existing one in `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/DateRangeFilter.tsx` is already written for the Dashboard. For the TransactionsPage, based on the mockup and tests, it needs:\n   - \"Date Range\" label\n   - Calendar icon on the left\n   - Displays a date range value (e.g., \"Oct 1, 2023 - Oct 31, 2023\")\n   - Click opens a date range picker\n   - Selecting new dates filters the table\n   - Clear functionality\n\nThe existing DateRangeFilter has most of what I need, but the mockup shows a different layout for the Transactions page—there's a \"Filters\" header with a \"Clear Filters\" link, and the four filters (Date Range, Involved Account(s), Material, Transaction Type) are arranged in a row with individual labels above each one. I'll need to create a new filter layout component rather than reusing the existing DateRangeFilter as-is.\n\nLooking at the full page structure, I need to build out several components: dedicated filter components for accounts, materials, and transaction types as multi-select dropdowns, a search bar, the transactions table, and pagination controls with page navigation and rows-per-page selection. The existing DateRangeFilter structure is solid, so I can adapt that pattern for the other filters rather than starting from scratch. specs more carefully:\n\n   For DateRangeFilter tests:\n   - \"Date Range\" labeled filter\n   - Calendar icon on the left\n   - Displays date range value\n   - Clicking opens date range picker\n   - Selecting dates filters table\n   - Clearing resets\n\n   The existing DateRangeFilter component works well for this. I might just need to adjust the label from \"Filter by Date:\" to \"Date Range\" and ensure data-testids match.\n\n   Actually, looking at the mockup more carefully, each filter is displayed as a separate dropdown-like element with its own label above it. The layout is:\n   \n   ```\n   Filters                                            Clear Filters\n   Date Range         Involved Account(s)    Material           Transaction Type\n   [Oct 1-Oct 31]     [selected (2)]         [selected (2)]    [All Types (...)]\n   ```\n\n   Below that is a search bar and sort dropdown. Now I'm thinking through the component structure: I'll update the existing DateRangeFilter to fit this layout, then build AccountFilter and MaterialFilter as custom multi-select dropdowns since the current FilterSelect only handles single selection. I also need to check if the backend's fetchTransactions thunk can handle multiple account and material IDs, or if I need to extend it.\n\nLooking at the backend support, the current API only accepts single `account_id` and `material_id` parameters. Since the transactions already include detailed transfer and batch data, I'll implement client-side filtering for accounts and materials—this way I can match transactions that involve any of the selected accounts or materials without needing backend changes.\n\nNow I need to build out the pagination component for TransactionsPage, which is more involved than MaterialsPagination. It needs First/Last buttons, page number display with ellipsis, a rows-per-page dropdown, and proper disabled states. Let me start implementing these components systematically.\n\nFor the DateRangeFilter, the existing component mostly works but I need to adjust the label from \"Filter by Date:\" to \"Date Range\" to match the test expectations and the mockup layout where labels appear above the filter controls.\n\nSince the existing DateRangeFilter is already used on the DashboardPage, I should avoid breaking that usage. I'm considering either creating a separate `TransactionsDateRangeFilter` component or making the existing one more flexible with optional props.\n\nThe cleanest approach is to create separate, TransactionsPage-specific filter components rather than modifying the existing ones, which keeps the Dashboard implementation untouched and gives me full control over the layout and styling for the new page. Looking at the test file more carefully, the component names should match what's actually being tested—DateRangeFilter, AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, TransactionTypeFilter, SearchBar, TransactionsTable, and Pagination. I'll make Pagination a separate component since it's listed independently in the tests, even though it could be nested within the page.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the mockup details to understand the table structure and layout—it shows sortable Date and Transaction ID columns, a sort dropdown above the table, result count text, and pagination controls at the bottom with rows-per-page selection. I'm also checking the backend transaction schema to see what fields are available for display.\n\nWriting the component code... where it comes from (credit) and destination is where it goes to (debit). Looking at the test data for TXN-100245, a purchase of Steel Plates has Raw Materials Inventory as the debit and Accounts Payable as the credit. So the transfer schema maps source_account to the credit side and destination_account to the debit side, meaning material flows from source to destination.\n\nThe account numbers in the mockup like \"(1200)\" aren't stored separately in our schema—they're embedded in the account name field itself, same with material codes like \"(M001)\". So I'll just display the names as they are in the database.\n\nFor the materials column, since the schema only has material_name, amount, and unit with no pricing data, I'll format it as \"Material Name (Code): Amount Unit\" and separate multiple materials with semicolons.\n\nBut the test expects pricing information like \"$2.50/kg ($1,250.00)\" which isn't stored in our database—I need to figure out where that data comes from or if I'm misunderstanding the schema. , quantity_transfers has source_account_id, destination_account_id, material_id, amount, and unit—no price field. The test data seems to expect pricing information we don't have in the schema, so I'll display what's actually available: material name, amount, and unit.\n\nNow I'm realizing the fetchTransactions thunk only supports single filters, but the AccountFilter and MaterialFilter components are multi-select. I'll fetch all transactions upfront and handle filtering client-side instead, matching how MaterialsPage works. This keeps things responsive without re-fetching on every filter change, and with 145 items it's manageable for client-side processing.\n\nWriting the transaction fetching logic... I need to make the DateRangeFilter component more flexible by adding an optional label prop, so I can reuse it on the TransactionsPage with \"Date Range\" instead of the current \"Filter by Date:\" label without breaking the existing DashboardPage implementation. Looking at the grid layout in the mockup, each filter needs its label positioned above it. The test expects the DateRangeFilter component itself to include the label, so I'll add an optional `label` prop to the existing component rather than handling it at the page level. I see the layout issue—the TransactionsPage needs labels positioned above the filters in a grid, not inline like the Dashboard's DateRangeFilter. Rather than retrofitting the existing component, I'll create dedicated filter components for the TransactionsPage: a flexible DateRangeFilter update, new multi-select dropdowns for accounts and materials, a single-select for transaction types, a search bar, a sortable table, and pagination handling. I'm going to simplify this and just make the label a configurable prop on DateRangeFilter, letting the parent handle the layout rather than forcing a specific wrapper. Let me check how the existing DashboardPage uses it first, then look at what the TransactionsPage tests expect. Now I'm mapping out the remaining filter components. AccountFilter needs a multi-select dropdown showing account names with IDs and a \"(2 selected)\" indicator when multiple are chosen. MaterialFilter follows the same pattern with material names and codes. TransactionTypeFilter is different—it's a single-select that defaults to showing all transaction types together, with an \"All Types\" option in the dropdown. SearchBar needs a magnifying glass icon integrated into the input field.\n\nFor the TransactionsTable, I'm looking at the sorting and display requirements: there's a sort dropdown defaulting to \"Date (Newest First)\" with multiple sort options available, a results counter showing the range and total, and sortable columns for Date and Transaction ID with visual indicators. The table displays transaction details across multiple columns, rows are clickable to navigate to detail views, and there's an empty state message when no results exist.\n\nFor pagination, I need to implement navigation buttons (First, Previous, numbered pages with ellipsis, Next, Last), highlight the current page, show the results counter, include a rows-per-page dropdown defaulting to 10, disable navigation buttons appropriately at the boundaries, and reset to page 1 when filters change.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the backend requirements: the TransactionsPage needs to fetch all transactions with their related transfers and batches, pull all accounts for the filter dropdown, and retrieve all materials.\n\nThe existing Redux thunks already handle these fetches, so I can rely on client-side filtering rather than modifying the backend. For the filter components, I'm debating whether to create a shared MultiSelectFilter component or write AccountFilter and MaterialFilter separately—they have similar behavior but different data
