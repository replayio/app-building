The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n\n4. CreateReportDialog (N/A)\n   Description: A dialog to specify a report based on the accounts and their transactions. The layout likely includes controls or filters for selecting report type (e.g., summary, detailed, category-based), date ranges, and which accounts or categories (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) to include. The page also provides functionality to refresh or regenerate reports based on new parameters and may link back to specific account detail pages when users click on report items. Budget versus actual comparisons are a core feature of these reports.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdH0QZwUJBicXIxYl7ANfnRyzLoKQCwtb1e8Wj\n\n5. ReportDetails (/reports/:id)\n   Description: Details about the contents of a generated report.  The page displays reports that compare actual results to budgeted amounts, both at the account level and potentially at the specific-item level (e.g., big expenses). Reports may be shown as tables, charts, or both, highlighting variances between actual and budgeted figures.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KduvOBXPH0NlcrvAhaRjg7E2zVpwb9xeY8LoBG\n\n6. ReportList (/reports)\n   Description: List of all generated reports and their top level info.  Here is the prompt for generating a report: A dialog to specify a report based on the accounts and their transactions. The layout likely includes controls or filters for selecting report type (e.g., summary, detailed, category-based), date ranges, and which accounts or categories (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) to include.

See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2.

The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→and a `timestamp`:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    60→    }\n    61→  ]\n    62→}\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly.

Each `--subtask` flag\n    69→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    70→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    71→\n    72→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    73→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    74→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    75→\n    76→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    77→\n    78→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    79→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    80→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    81→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    82→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    83→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    84→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    85→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    86→\n    87→## Tech Stack\n    88→\n    89→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    90→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    91→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    92→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    93→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    94→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    95→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    96→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    97→\n    98→## Database\n    99→\n   100→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   101→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   102→frontend components.\n   103→\n   104→## Quality Gates\n   105→\n   106→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   107→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   108→\n   109→## Commits\n   110→\n   111→The worker commits automatically after each iteration.

Logo text is \"InventoryFlow\". Uses `data-testid=\"navbar\"` with `navbar-link-{key}` pattern. Horizontal header bar (not a sidebar).\n\n- **DashboardPage** (`/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`): The only fully implemented page. Features:\n  - `DateRangeFilter` -- a popover with date inputs and \"Apply\" button\n  - `CategoryFilter` -- a custom dropdown to filter by material category\n  - `LowInventoryAlerts` -- a table of alerts with severity badges, dismiss buttons, and reorder links\n  - `MaterialsCategoriesOverview` -- flex-wrapped cards showing categories with material links and quantities\n  - `RecentTransactionsTable` -- HTML `<table>` with date, reference, accounts affected, materials/amounts, and view details link\n  - `NewTransactionButton` -- navigates to `/transactions/new`\n\n- **Stub pages**: AccountsPage, AccountDetailPage, MaterialsPage, MaterialDetailPage, BatchesPage, BatchDetailPage, TransactionsPage, TransactionDetailPage, NewTransactionPage, SettingsPage are all stubs that render just an `<h1>` title.\n\n- **Types** (`/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/types/index.ts`): Defines `Account` (stock/input/output categories), `Material`, `MaterialCategory`, `Batch` (with lot_number, expiration_date, quality_grade, storage_condition), `Transaction` (purchase/consumption/transfer/production/adjustment), `QuantityTransfer` (double-entry transfers between accounts), `BatchCreated`, `BatchLineage`, `LowInventoryAlert`, `CategoryOverview`, `MaterialStock`, `AccountMaterial`.\n\n- **Slices**: All slices follow the same pattern -- `createAsyncThunk` for fetching from `/.netlify/functions/...`, with pending/fulfilled/rejected cases. The `dashboardSlice` handles `fetchDashboardData` (with date_from, date_to, category_id params) and `dismissAlert`. The `materialsSlice` supports search, category_id, and account_id filters. The `transactionsSlice` supports filtering by account_id, material_id, transaction_type, date_from, date_to, and search.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `/repo/apps/Accounting/`\n\n**Full src/ file listing:**\n```\nsrc/\n  App.tsx\n  main.tsx\n  store.ts\n  hooks.ts\n  index.css\n  vite-env.d.ts\n  types/\n    index.ts\n  components/\n    AccountCard.tsx\n    AccountsOverviewHeader.tsx\n    CreateReportDialog.tsx\n    NavBar.tsx\n    NewTransactionModal.tsx\n  pages/\n    AccountDetailPage.tsx      (stub)\n    AccountsPage.tsx           (fully implemented)\n    BudgetsPage.tsx            (stub)\n    DashboardPage.tsx          (stub)\n    LoginPage.tsx              (stub)\n    ReportDetailsPage.tsx      (stub)\n    ReportListPage.tsx         (stub)\n  slices/\n    accountsSlice.ts\n    budgetsSlice.ts\n    reportsSlice.ts\n    transactionsSlice.ts\nnetlify/functions/\n    accounts.ts\ntests/\n    accounts-page.spec.ts\n    deployment.spec.ts\n```\n\n**Key architectural details:**\n\n- **Entry point** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/main.tsx`): Identical pattern to InventoryTracker -- StrictMode, Redux Provider, BrowserRouter.\n\n- **Store** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/store.ts`): Uses `createAppStore` from `@shared/store/store` with reducers: `auth`, `accounts`, `transactions`, `reports`, `budgets`.\n\n- **Routes** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/App.tsx`): 7 routes -- `/` (redirects to /accounts), `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/accounts`, `/accounts/:id`, `/reports`, `/reports/:id`, `/budgets`.\n\n- **Navigation** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NavBar.tsx`): Top navbar with logo \"FINANCEWEB\", links to Dashboard, Accounts, Reports, Budgets. Also includes a \"New Transaction\" button in the header actions area, user avatar display, and \"Log Out\" button. Includes a `Breadcrumb` sub-component. Uses `data-testid=\"navbar\"` pattern. The NavBar also renders the `NewTransactionModal` when the \"New Transaction\" button is clicked. NavBar is **not** in App.tsx -- instead each page includes `<NavBar />` explicitly.\n\n- **AccountsPage** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/pages/AccountsPage.tsx`): The only fully implemented page. Features:\n  - Groups accounts by category (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) using `CategoryGroup` from `@shared/components/CategorySection`\n  - Renders `AccountCard` for each account\n  - Shows formatted currency totals per category\n  - Assets and Liabilities are expanded by default; others collapsed\n\n- **AccountCard** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/AccountCard.tsx`): A rich card component showing:\n  - Account name with institution\n  - Context menu (edit, view transactions, delete)\n  - Balance display with `formatCurrency`\n  - Debits/Credits YTD\n  - Budget progress bar (BudgetBar sub-component) with warning/over states\n  - Performance indicator (positive/negative percentage)\n  - Savings goal progress bar\n  - Credit limit usage percentage\n  - Monthly payment and interest rate display\n\n- **NewTransactionModal** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`): Full double-entry transaction form:\n  - Date, description fields\n  - Line items with `SearchableSelect` for accounts (from `@shared/components/SearchableSelect`)\n  - Debit/Credit toggle per line item\n  - Amount input\n  - Tags input (press Enter to add)\n  - Balance indicator showing total debits vs credits and balanced/unbalanced status\n  - Add/remove line items\n\n- **CreateReportDialog** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/CreateReportDialog.tsx`): Modal dialog for generating financial reports:\n  - Report name, report type selector (summary/detailed/budget_vs_actual)\n  - Date range start/end inputs\n  - Categories filter text input\n  - Include zero-balance checkbox\n\n- **Stub pages**: AccountDetailPage, DashboardPage, ReportListPage, ReportDetailsPage, BudgetsPage, LoginPage are all stubs.\n\n- **Types** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/types/index.ts`): Defines `Account` (with assets/liabilities/equity/revenue/expenses categories, balance, budget_amount, budget_actual, interest_rate, credit_limit, monthly_payment, savings_goal fields, performance_pct, debits_ytd, credits_ytd), `Transaction` (with entries and tags), `TransactionEntry` (debit/credit), `Tag`, `Budget`, `Report`, `ReportItem`.\n\n- **Slices**: `accountsSlice` has fetchAccounts, fetchAccountById, deleteAccount. `transactionsSlice` has fetchTransactions (optional accountId), createTransaction, deleteTransaction. `reportsSlice` has fetchReports, fetchReportById, createReport, deleteReport. `budgetsSlice` has fetchBudgets (optional accountId), createBudget, updateBudget, deleteBudget.\n\n---\n\n### 5. `/repo/apps/shared/` (Shared Code)\n\n**File listing:**\n```\nauth/\n  authSlice.ts          -- Redux slice for user auth (setUser, clearUser, setLoading)\n  useAuth.ts            -- Hook wrapping auth state/actions\nbackend/\n  db.ts                 -- Neon Postgres connector with getDb(), query(), queryOne(), errorResponse(), jsonResponse()\ncomponents/\n  CategorySection.tsx   -- Generic collapsible category sections (CategorySection + CategoryGroup)\n  CategorySection.css\n  SearchableSelect.tsx  -- Searchable dropdown select component\nlayout/\n  AppLayout.tsx         -- App shell with sidebar + main content area\n  Sidebar.tsx           -- Sidebar navigation component (appName, navItems, activePath, userName, onLogout)\nstore/\n  hooks.ts              -- createTypedHooks() factory for typed Redux hooks\n  store.ts              -- createAppStore() wrapper around configureStore\nstyles/\n  common.css\n  layout.css\n  tokens.css\nutils/\n  currency.ts           -- formatCurrency(), formatNumber(), parseCurrency()\n  date.ts               -- formatDate(), formatDateTime(), formatDateRange()\n  doubleEntry.ts        -- validateEntriesBalanced(), validateNonZeroAmounts(), validateAccountIds(), validateTransaction(), computeDebitCreditTotals()\n```\n\n**Notable patterns:**\n- The shared `AppLayout` + `Sidebar` components exist but are **not currently used** by either InventoryTracker or Accounting -- both apps use their own horizontal navbar instead.\n- The `SearchableSelect` is used by Accounting's `NewTransactionModal` for account selection in transaction line items.\n- The `CategorySection`/`CategoryGroup` is used by Accounting's `AccountsPage` for grouping accounts by category.\n- The `formatCurrency` utility is used by Accounting's `AccountCard` and `NewTransactionModal`.\n- The `@shared` path alias resolves to `../shared/*` relative to each app's directory, meaning `/repo/apps/shared/`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Component Patterns Relevant to Calendar, Equipment, Comments, Tables, and Search\n\n- **Calendar/Date filtering**: `DateRangeFilter` in InventoryTracker uses a popover with two native `<input type=\"date\">` fields, a display format function, and an \"Apply\" button. Accounting's `CreateReportDialog` also has date range inputs for reports.\n\n- **Tables**: `RecentTransactionsTable` in InventoryTracker uses a standard HTML `<table>` with `data-table` CSS class, with `data-testid` on rows and cells. `LowInventoryAlerts` also uses a `<table>` with the same pattern.\n\n- **Search/Select**: `SearchableSelect` (shared component) provides a searchable dropdown. Filtering in slices is done via URL query parameters (search, category_id, etc.). `CategoryFilter` provides a custom dropdown for selecting material categories.\n\n- **Equipment**: No equipment-specific components exist in these apps. The closest concept is `Batch` in InventoryTracker (which has `storage_condition`, `quality_grade`, `location`).\n\n- **Comments**: No comment components exist in either app.\n\n- **Navigation**: Both apps use horizontal top navbar patterns. InventoryTracker uses `NavigationHeader` with `<a>` tags. Accounting uses `NavBar` with `<button>` tags. The shared `Sidebar`/`AppLayout` components are available but unused."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a9472bc814a56d769 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 82176\ntool_uses: 83\nduration_ms: 138800</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"29f9c70d-be34-45a1-a8d4-b264bbe3f0fb","uuid":"12848aec-880e-4ac2-b507-3b9fdb46a484","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the existing app implementations.

The `transactionsSlice` supports filtering by account_id, material_id, transaction_type, date_from, date_to, and search.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `/repo/apps/Accounting/`\n\n**Full src/ file listing:**\n```\nsrc/\n  App.tsx\n  main.tsx\n  store.ts\n  hooks.ts\n  index.css\n  vite-env.d.ts\n  types/\n    index.ts\n  components/\n    AccountCard.tsx\n    AccountsOverviewHeader.tsx\n    CreateReportDialog.tsx\n    NavBar.tsx\n    NewTransactionModal.tsx\n  pages/\n    AccountDetailPage.tsx      (stub)\n    AccountsPage.tsx           (fully implemented)\n    BudgetsPage.tsx            (stub)\n    DashboardPage.tsx          (stub)\n    LoginPage.tsx              (stub)\n    ReportDetailsPage.tsx      (stub)\n    ReportListPage.tsx         (stub)\n  slices/\n    accountsSlice.ts\n    budgetsSlice.ts\n    reportsSlice.ts\n    transactionsSlice.ts\nnetlify/functions/\n    accounts.ts\ntests/\n    accounts-page.spec.ts\n    deployment.spec.ts\n```\n\n**Key architectural details:**\n\n- **Entry point** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/main.tsx`): Identical pattern to InventoryTracker -- StrictMode, Redux Provider, BrowserRouter.\n\n- **Store** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/store.ts`): Uses `createAppStore` from `@shared/store/store` with reducers: `auth`, `accounts`, `transactions`, `reports`, `budgets`.\n\n- **Routes** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/App.tsx`): 7 routes -- `/` (redirects to /accounts), `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/accounts`, `/accounts/:id`, `/reports`, `/reports/:id`, `/budgets`.\n\n- **Navigation** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NavBar.tsx`): Top navbar with logo \"FINANCEWEB\", links to Dashboard, Accounts, Reports, Budgets. Also includes a \"New Transaction\" button in the header actions area, user avatar display, and \"Log Out\" button. Includes a `Breadcrumb` sub-component. Uses `data-testid=\"navbar\"` pattern. The NavBar also renders the `NewTransactionModal` when the \"New Transaction\" button is clicked. NavBar is **not** in App.tsx -- instead each page includes `<NavBar />` explicitly.\n\n- **AccountsPage** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/pages/AccountsPage.tsx`): The only fully implemented page. Features:\n  - Groups accounts by category (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) using `CategoryGroup` from `@shared/components/CategorySection`\n  - Renders `AccountCard` for each account\n  - Shows formatted currency totals per category\n  - Assets and Liabilities are expanded by default; others collapsed\n\n- **AccountCard** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/AccountCard.tsx`): A rich card component showing:\n  - Account name with institution\n  - Context menu (edit, view transactions, delete)\n  - Balance display with `formatCurrency`\n  - Debits/Credits YTD\n  - Budget progress bar (BudgetBar sub-component) with warning/over states\n  - Performance indicator (positive/negative percentage)\n  - Savings goal progress bar\n  - Credit limit usage percentage\n  - Monthly payment and interest rate display\n\n- **NewTransactionModal** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`): Full double-entry transaction form:\n  - Date, description fields\n  - Line items with `SearchableSelect` for accounts (from `@shared/components/SearchableSelect`)\n  - Debit/Credit toggle per line item\n  - Amount input\n  - Tags input (press Enter to add)\n  - Balance indicator showing total debits vs credits and balanced/unbalanced status\n  - Add/remove line items\n\n- **CreateReportDialog** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/CreateReportDialog.tsx`): Modal dialog for generating financial reports:\n  - Report name, report type selector (summary/detailed/budget_vs_actual)\n  - Date range start/end inputs\n  - Categories filter text input\n  - Include zero-balance checkbox\n\n- **Stub pages**: AccountDetailPage, DashboardPage, ReportListPage, ReportDetailsPage, BudgetsPage, LoginPage are all stubs.\n\n- **Types** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/types/index.ts`): Defines `Account` (with assets/liabilities/equity/revenue/expenses categories, balance, budget_amount, budget_actual, interest_rate, credit_limit, monthly_payment, savings_goal fields, performance_pct, debits_ytd, credits_ytd), `Transaction` (with entries and tags), `TransactionEntry` (debit/credit), `Tag`, `Budget`, `Report`, `ReportItem`.\n\n- **Slices**: `accountsSlice` has fetchAccounts, fetchAccountById, deleteAccount. `transactionsSlice` has fetchTransactions (optional accountId), createTransaction, deleteTransaction. `reportsSlice` has fetchReports, fetchReportById, createReport, deleteReport. `budgetsSlice` has fetchBudgets (optional accountId), createBudget, updateBudget, deleteBudget.\n\n---\n\n### 5. `/repo/apps/shared/` (Shared Code)\n\n**File listing:**\n```\nauth/\n  authSlice.ts          -- Redux slice for user auth (setUser, clearUser, setLoading)\n  useAuth.ts            -- Hook wrapping auth state/actions\nbackend/\n  db.ts                 -- Neon Postgres connector with getDb(), query(), queryOne(), errorResponse(), jsonResponse()\ncomponents/\n  CategorySection.tsx   -- Generic collapsible category sections (CategorySection + CategoryGroup)\n  CategorySection.css\n  SearchableSelect.tsx  -- Searchable dropdown select component\nlayout/\n  AppLayout.tsx         -- App shell with sidebar + main content area\n  Sidebar.tsx           -- Sidebar navigation component (appName, navItems, activePath, userName, onLogout)\nstore/\n  hooks.ts              -- createTypedHooks() factory for typed Redux hooks\n  store.ts              -- createAppStore() wrapper around configureStore\nstyles/\n  common.css\n  layout.css\n  tokens.css\nutils/\n  currency.ts           -- formatCurrency(), formatNumber(), parseCurrency()\n  date.ts               -- formatDate(), formatDateTime(), formatDateRange()\n  doubleEntry.ts        -- validateEntriesBalanced(), validateNonZeroAmounts(), validateAccountIds(), validateTransaction(), computeDebitCreditTotals()\n```\n\n**Notable patterns:**\n- The shared `AppLayout` + `Sidebar` components exist but are **not currently used** by either InventoryTracker or Accounting -- both apps use their own horizontal navbar instead.\n- The `SearchableSelect` is used by Accounting's `NewTransactionModal` for account selection in transaction line items.\n- The `CategorySection`/`CategoryGroup` is used by Accounting's `AccountsPage` for grouping accounts by category.\n- The `formatCurrency` utility is used by Accounting's `AccountCard` and `NewTransactionModal`.\n- The `@shared` path alias resolves to `../shared/*` relative to each app's directory, meaning `/repo/apps/shared/`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Component Patterns Relevant to Calendar, Equipment, Comments, Tables, and Search\n\n- **Calendar/Date filtering**: `DateRangeFilter` in InventoryTracker uses a popover with two native `<input type=\"date\">` fields, a display format function, and an \"Apply\" button. Accounting's `CreateReportDialog` also has date range inputs for reports.\n\n- **Tables**: `RecentTransactionsTable` in InventoryTracker uses a standard HTML `<table>` with `data-table` CSS class, with `data-testid` on rows and cells. `LowInventoryAlerts` also uses a `<table>` with the same pattern.\n\n- **Search/Select**: `SearchableSelect` (shared component) provides a searchable dropdown. Filtering in slices is done via URL query parameters (search, category_id, etc.). `CategoryFilter` provides a custom dropdown for selecting material categories.\n\n- **Equipment**: No equipment-specific components exist in these apps. The closest concept is `Batch` in InventoryTracker (which has `storage_condition`, `quality_grade`, `location`).\n\n- **Comments**: No comment components exist in either app.\n\n- **Navigation**: Both apps use horizontal top navbar patterns. InventoryTracker uses `NavigationHeader` with `<a>` tags. Accounting uses `NavBar` with `<button>` tags. The shared `Sidebar`/`AppLayout` components are available but unused."}],"totalDurationMs":138800,"totalTokens":82176,"totalToolUseCount":83,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2711,"cache_read_input_tokens":76068,"output_tokens":3396,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2711},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"29f9c70d-be34-45a1-a8d4-b264bbe3f0fb","uuid":"7a3bf5ad-1914-47db-9f5d-004748dc5d91","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}
[2026-02-24T23:50:12.212Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Ea6rdxhD4CqBrqMobJZSkk","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a comprehensive understanding of:\n\n1. **ProductionHub** has 6 pages: RecipesPage, CalendarPage, RunDetailsPage, RecipeDetailsPage, EquipmentPage, EquipmentDetailsPage\n2. **Existing apps**: InventoryTracker and Accounting are built; SupplierTracker and SalesCRM are only specs\n3. **Existing shared code**: auth, backend, components, layout, store, styles, utils\n\nNow I need to follow the skill's instructions for the \"Unpack\" subtask:\n\n> Unpack the task to write shared code by first looking in the apps/ directory and at your instructions for any information about other apps that can share code with the app you will be building.\n\n\n>\n> If there are other apps, use `add-task` to unpack into the following subtasks:\n> 1. One subtask to write/refactor shared code for app-wide logic: backend, reducers, auth, navigation.\n> 2. One subtask for each page to write/refactor shared code for each component on that page.\n\nSince there are other apps, I need to unpack this into subtasks. Looking at ProductionHub's requirements against what's already shared, the backend and auth are already handled by existing shared code, so I'll focus on what actually needs unpacking for the app-wide logic and then create subtasks for each of the six pages.\n\nFor the pages themselves, I'm starting to analyze what components can be shared. RecipesPage has a header, table, and details panel, and the table is where I need to look closer at what's reusable.\n\nThe pagination pattern in RecipesTable matches what EquipmentTable does, so I could extract a shared Pagination component. RecipesHeader has a search bar and filter dropdown, which are common patterns. The RecipeDetailsPanel is specific to ProductionHub though.\n\nCalendarPage is entirely unique to ProductionHub—no other app in the suite has a calendar feature, so there's nothing to share there.\n\nFor RunDetailsPage, I'm looking at what components it has and whether any of them appear elsewhere. ForecastTable, RunEquipmentTable, ExternalAppLinks\n   - RunHeader has breadcrumbs - Accounting also uses breadcrumbs (in NavBar). Could share a Breadcrumb component.\n   - Tables are standard data tables using the shared common.css styles.\n   - Unique to ProductionHub's domain.\n\n4. **RecipeDetailsPage** - Has RecipeDetailHeader, DescriptionCard, ProductsOutputTable, RawMaterialsCard, EquipmentRequiredList\n   - RecipeDetailHeader has breadcrumbs - again could share Breadcrumb.\n   - DescriptionCard - a simple card with heading and text. Common pattern.\n\n5. **EquipmentPage** - Has EquipmentHeader, EquipmentTable with pagination and edit/delete actions in table rows.\n\n6. **EquipmentDetailsPage** - Has EquipmentDetailHeader, EquipmentInfo, MaintenanceNotes\n   - MaintenanceNotes is a comment system that appears across multiple apps - SupplierTracker has comments, SalesCRM has timeline/contact history.\n   - EquipmentInfo handles image uploads via UploadThing.\n   - EquipmentDetailHeader includes breadcrumbs.\n\nLooking at the patterns across all these pages, I'm noticing some genuinely shared components worth extracting: a Breadcrumb component used throughout, a comment/notes system that spans ProductionHub, SupplierTracker, and SalesCRM, and pagination that appears in multiple tables. for recipes, Scheduled/Confirmed/Cancelled for runs, Operational/Maintenance for equipment, On Track/Material Shortage/Scheduled/In Progress/Pending Approval for calendar events). Confirmation dialogs appear across ProductionHub for destructive actions like deleting recipes or equipment, and other apps probably need these too.\n\nLet me think about what actually qualifies as shared. The requirement is that code should have identical or nearly identical needs across different apps. Comments and notes show up in ProductionHub's maintenance section, SupplierTracker would use them for supplier feedback, and SalesCRM has a timeline with notes—that's a genuine shared pattern. Pagination makes sense too since InventoryTracker will need it for accounts, materials, batches, and transactions once fully built. Breadcrumbs are consistently used across ProductionHub's detail pages and Accounting's navigation, so that's worth extracting. Status badges already have styles in common.css and are used extensively. Confirmation dialogs for delete and cancel operations appear in multiple places.\n\nBut I need to be careful here—the skill emphasizes extracting code that's truly identical across apps. Accounting already has a Breadcrumb component embedded in NavBar.tsx, so I should check if that's the right place to extract from. Let me look more closely at what the test spec actually expects for the comment system in EquipmentDetailsPage.\n\nThe MaintenanceNotes section needs author name, role, date/time, text, and reverse chronological ordering. SupplierTracker mentions comments for supplier notes, which seems similar enough that I could build a shared component. So my subtasks are: extract any app-wide shared code like the Breadcrumb if it makes sense, create a Pagination component that works across RecipesPage and EquipmentPage, build a reusable Confirmation Dialog, and handle the comment system that both EquipmentDetailsPage and SupplierTracker can use. CalendarPage and RunDetailsPage don't seem to need much beyond what's already shared. shared code**: Pagination component (used by both RecipesTable and EquipmentTable, plus other apps' list pages). Comments/Notes component (needed by EquipmentDetailsPage and potentially other detail pages).\n\nSo my subtasks should be: one for app-wide shared code covering breadcrumbs and confirmation dialogs, one for the pagination component, and one for the comments/notes component. I need to be more careful about what actually qualifies as a shared component—let me check if the patterns across these pages are truly identical or just similar enough to warrant extraction.\n\nThe Breadcrumb pattern is consistent across all the detail pages, so that's definitely worth extracting. For Pagination, the two tables have slightly different implementations—RecipesTable includes first and last buttons while EquipmentTable doesn't—but the core pagination logic is similar enough that I could create a flexible component to handle both cases.\n\nLooking at the Comments/Notes pattern, ProductionHub's MaintenanceNotes and SupplierTracker's Comments are essentially the same thing, just with different names. And ConfirmDialog is clearly needed across multiple apps for delete operations.\n\nSo I'm going to organize the shared components into two main groups: one for app-wide patterns like Breadcrumb and ConfirmDialog, and another for the table-related components like Pagination that the list pages will need. I'm realizing that Pagination shouldn't be app-wide since it's a UI component, not core infrastructure—it makes more sense to group it with the pages that actually use it. So I'll organize the subtasks around pages that have page-specific shared components: one for app-wide code like Breadcrumb and ConfirmDialog, one for RecipesPage with Pagination, and one for EquipmentDetailsPage with CommentsSection, while skipping pages like CalendarPage and RunDetailsPage that don't need their own subtasks since they either have unique components or only rely on app-wide shared code.\n\nNow I need to create these subtasks using the `add-task` command and make sure they all reference the same skill for writing shared code.

But Accounting has an inline Breadcrumb component in its NavBar that should be extracted since ProductionHub needs breadcrumbs on RunDetailsPage, RecipeDetailsPage, and EquipmentDetailsPage. Also, ConfirmDialog is needed across multiple apps (recipe deletion, equipment deletion, run cancellation).\n\n2. **RecipesPage / EquipmentPage** - Both need a Pagination component (RecipesTable uses <<, <, >, >> buttons; EquipmentTable uses <, > with \"Page X of Y\"). This pattern is needed by other apps' list pages too.\n\n3. **EquipmentDetailsPage** - MaintenanceNotes is a comment system (author, role, date, text, reverse chronological). SupplierTracker spec has \"Comments added for notes about the supplier\" - nearly identical pattern. SalesCRM has timeline with notes.
