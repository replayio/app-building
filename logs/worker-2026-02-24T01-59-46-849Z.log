Read `strategies/jobs/build/testing.md` to understand how to run tests and debug failures.\n\n## Updating revisions\n\nIf the bug fix changed the app's behavior relative to the original `AppSpec.md` — for example,\nadding new functionality, removing a feature, or changing how something works — update\n`AppRevisions.md` (create the file next to `AppSpec.md` if it doesn't exist).\n\n`AppRevisions.md` is NOT a changelog. It is organized by topic sections that describe either\nnew functionality added to the app or changes made to the app spec in particular areas. Each\nsection has a heading describing the area (e.g., \"## Attachment Uploads\", \"## Authentication\",\n\"## CSV Import\") and a description of the current state of that functionality.\n\nWhen updating revisions:\n- If an existing section covers the area you changed, update that section's description to\n  reflect the current behavior.\n- If the change introduces a new area of functionality, add a new section.\n- Keep descriptions focused on **what the app does now**, not a history of changes.\n\nIf the fix was purely a code bug that didn't change the intended behavior, skip this step.\n\n## Resolving bugs\n\nNow that the bug is fixed, move it from the top section of the file to an \"Unreviewed\" section lower down.\nLabel the bug with the git revision before / after the bug was fixed and tests updated.\n\nMove the report to the appropriate section in `docs/bugReports.md`.\n","numLines":80,"startLine":1,"totalLines":80}}}
