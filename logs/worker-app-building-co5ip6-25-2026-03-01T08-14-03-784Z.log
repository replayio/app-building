A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c4b5e05c-4270-4e33-8971-0485230ecf2b","uuid":"f54df044-451b-419b-960c-1d635b1a3e26","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

I need to:\n\n1. **AppHeader: Displays app description** - Test that navigating to AppPage shows the description\n2. **AppHeader: Displays metadata line with Created date, Model, and Deployment** - Test that the metadata line shows Created, Model, Deployment separated by pipes\n3. **AppHeader: Metadata line shows correct values from app data** - Test with two different apps that their metadata is correct\n4. **AppActions: Open Live App button visible for completed app** - Test that for a completed app, the Open Live App button is visible\n\nLooking at the existing test data:\n\n\n- `buildingApp` has `created_at: '2023-10-26T00:00:00Z'`, `model: 'gpt-4 Turbo'`, and no deployment URL\n- `completedApp` has `created_at: '2023-11-01T00:00:00Z'`, `model: 'Claude 3'`, and `deployment_url: 'https://deployed-platform.vercel.app'`\n- `queuedApp` has `created_at: '2023-12-05T00:00:00Z'`, `model: 'gpt-4o'`, and a deployment URL of null\n\nFor test 2, I need an app created on Oct 26, 2023 with gpt-4 Turbo that's deployed to Vercel, but buildingApp is missing the deployment URL. The completedApp has the right deployment URL but wrong date and model. I'm realizing the test expects \"deployed to Vercel\" but the component extracts the hostname from the URL, which would show `deployed-platform.vercel.app` rather than just \"Vercel\".\n\nFor test 3, I need to handle multiple apps with different creation dates, models, and deployment platforms like Netlify. I'm realizing the test spec descriptions are more about intent than exact values—what matters is that the component correctly displays whatever metadata the app object contains. Since the component extracts the hostname from the deployment URL, I should write tests that work with actual data the component will process, rather than trying to match the spec's descriptive text exactly. For test 2, I need a mock app with Oct 26, 2023, gpt-4 Turbo, and a deployment URL. For test 3, the existing mocks have the right dates and models but wrong deployment URLs, so I'll create new ones matching the spec. Now I'm ready to write out all four tests.\n\nWriting test code... Now I'm setting up the expected metadata string for that first test case, then creating a couple more mock app entries with different deployment platforms to cover additional scenarios.\n\nI need to add an AppActions test block since the current file only has AppHeader tests, so I'll structure the edits to include both the new mock data and the additional test suite.","signature":"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
