This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   193→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   194→```\n   195→\n   196→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   197→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   198→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   199→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   200→\n   201→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   202→\n   203→## Directives\n   204→\n   205→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   211→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   212→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   213→\n   214→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   215→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   216→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   217→\n   218→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   219→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   220→\n   221→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   222→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   223→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   224→\n   225→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   226→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   227→\n   228→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   229→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   230→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   231→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   232→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   233→\n   234→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   235→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   236→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   237→\n   238→## Tips\n   239→\n   240→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   241→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   242→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   243→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   244→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   245→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   246→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   247→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   248→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   249→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   250→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   251→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   252→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   253→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   254→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   255→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   256→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   257→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   258→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   259→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   260→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   261→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   262→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   263→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   264→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   265→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   266→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   267→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   268→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   269→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   270→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   271→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":281,"startLine":1,"totalLines":281}}}

The test entries in docs/tests.md already have import-related entries:\n   - CLP-HDR-04: Import button opens import dialog with CSV format info (clients)\n   - CLP-HDR-06: CSV import creates clients from uploaded file\n   - CLP-HDR-07: Import Contacts button opens contacts import dialog\n   - CLP-HDR-08: CSV import creates contacts from uploaded file\n   - CTLP-HDR-04: Import button opens import dialog (contacts)\n   - CTLP-HDR-05: CSV import creates contacts from uploaded file\n   - DLP-HDR-04: Import button opens import dialog (deals)\n   - DLP-HDR-05: CSV import creates deals from uploaded file\n   - TLP-HDR-04: Import button opens import dialog (tasks)\n   - TLP-HDR-05: CSV import creates tasks from uploaded file\n   - Settings page import/export tests (STP-IE-01 through STP-IE-08)\n\n2. The Playwright tests already exist for these scenarios, so I need to add test entries in docs/tests.md that cover the actual CSV import workflow—file selection, import execution, and result verification—plus the CSV template download functionality for at least one entity type.\n\nLooking at the existing test entries, I see that CLP-HDR-04 documents the \"Download CSV template\" button as visible, but the actual test only checks visibility without verifying the download action itself. The directive requires that every interactive element be tested to confirm it actually works as expected, so I need to add a test entry that specifically covers clicking the template download button and verifying the file is downloaded. The core issue is that CLP-HDR-04 only verifies the download button exists visually, but doesn't actually test clicking it and confirming a CSV file downloads with the right columns. I need to add a specific test entry for the template download workflow, then check what other test coverage might be missing on the settings

Let me analyze what's present and what's missing:\n\n**What exists in docs/tests.md:**\n- CLP-HDR-04: Tests that the import dialog opens and shows a \"Download CSV template\" button, CSV format info, file input, etc. (visibility only)\n- CLP-HDR-06: Tests CSV import workflow for clients (file selection, import execution, result verification)\n- Similar entries exist for contacts (CTLP-HDR-04/05), deals (DLP-HDR-04/05), tasks (TLP-HDR-04/05)\n\n\n- The import workflow entries already cover file selection, import execution, and result verification\n\nThe gap is that the \"Download CSV template\" button is only tested for visibility, not for what actually happens when you click it. According to the testSpec.md directive, I need to verify that interactive elements work as expected—so I should add test entries that click the button and confirm the downloaded file contains the correct column headers. Looking at the contacts page, I notice it also has the \"Download CSV template\" button visible but no test actually verifies clicking it works. The real gap is that while import workflow tests exist across multiple entity types, there's no test entry confirming the template download button actually produces a properly formatted CSV file. Since the import tests are already covered, I just need to add template download verification for at least one entity type. I'm realizing the template download functionality isn't actually being tested in either CTLP-HDR-04 or CTLP-HDR-05, so I need to add dedicated test cases for that. Let me double-check the exact line reference to make sure I'm looking at the right section.","signature":"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

The violation is that:\n\n1. The \"Download CSV template\" button is mentioned in import dialog test entries (CLP-HDR-04, CTLP-HDR-04, DLP-HDR-04, TLP-HDR-04) as being visible, but **there are NO test entries that actually test clicking the button and verifying the downloaded CSV template**.\n\nPer the testSpec.md directive: \"The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something.\"\n\nSo I need to add test entries for CSV template download. The job says \"for at least one entity type.\" I'll add test entries for the Clients page as the primary example, since it's the first entity type listed.\n\n\nLooking at the job description more carefully, the actual CSV import workflow tests already exist, so the gap is specifically around testing the template download functionality. I'll add a test entry for downloading the CSV template from the clients import dialog. The tests currently only check that the download button is visible, not that it actually works. I need to add a test entry for the clients page that verifies the template download functionality produces a CSV file with the correct headers. I'll add this as CLP-HDR-09 after the existing import-related entries, though I should first verify that number isn't already taken.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3287,"cache_read_input_tokens":50692,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3287,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a3f9abbf-bf4b-47dc-b3d2-d80f08fd5fea","uuid":"accf8eb8-c225-4c8c-a767-d76165b9e8ac"}

I found the import dialog component. Here's my complete findings:\n\n## Import Dialog Component\n\n**File Path:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/ImportDialog.tsx`\n\n### 1. Component Overview\nThe `ImportDialog` is a React component that handles CSV imports with the following features:\n- Downloads CSV templates\n- Accepts file uploads\n- Parses CSV data and sends it to an API endpoint\n- Displays import results with error messages\n\n### 2. Test IDs Found\nAll three requested test IDs are implemented:\n- `download-template-button` (line 154)\n- `csv-file-input` (line 163)\n- `import-submit-button` (line 197)\n\n### 3. CSV Template Download Mechanism\n\nThe `handleDownloadTemplate()` function (lines 78-88) implements the download:\n\n```typescript\nfunction handleDownloadTemplate() {\n  const headers = columns.map(c => c.name).join(',')\n  const csv = headers + '\\n' + templateExample\n  const blob = new Blob([csv], { type: 'text/csv' })\n  const csvUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob)\n  const a = document.createElement('a')\n  a.href = csvUrl\n  a.download = templateFilename\n  a.click()\n  URL.revokeObjectURL(csvUrl)\n}\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Creates header row from the `columns` prop array (line 79)\n2. Combines headers with `templateExample` data (line 80)\n3. Creates a Blob object with CSV MIME type (line 81)\n4. Generates a temporary object URL (line 82)\n5. Creates an invisible anchor element and triggers download (lines 83-86)\n6. Cleans up the object URL after download (line 87)\n\n### 4. CSV Import Flow\n\nThe `handleImport()` function (lines 90-121) handles the full import:\n1. Reads the file as text (line 94)\n2. Parses CSV using custom parser (line 95)\n3.

Here's my complete findings:\n\n## Import Dialog Component\n\n**File Path:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/ImportDialog.tsx`\n\n### 1. Component Overview\nThe `ImportDialog` is a React component that handles CSV imports with the following features:\n- Downloads CSV templates\n- Accepts file uploads\n- Parses CSV data and sends it to an API endpoint\n- Displays import results with error messages\n\n### 2. Test IDs Found\nAll three requested test IDs are implemented:\n- `download-template-button` (line 154)\n- `csv-file-input` (line 163)\n- `import-submit-button` (line 197)\n\n### 3. CSV Template Download Mechanism\n\nThe `handleDownloadTemplate()` function (lines 78-88) implements the download:\n\n```typescript\nfunction handleDownloadTemplate() {\n  const headers = columns.map(c => c.name).join(',')\n  const csv = headers + '\\n' + templateExample\n  const blob = new Blob([csv], { type: 'text/csv' })\n  const csvUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob)\n  const a = document.createElement('a')\n  a.href = csvUrl\n  a.download = templateFilename\n  a.click()\n  URL.revokeObjectURL(csvUrl)\n}\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Creates header row from the `columns` prop array (line 79)\n2. Combines headers with `templateExample` data (line 80)\n3. Creates a Blob object with CSV MIME type (line 81)\n4. Generates a temporary object URL (line 82)\n5. Creates an invisible anchor element and triggers download (lines 83-86)\n6. Cleans up the object URL after download (line 87)\n\n### 4. CSV Import Flow\n\nThe `handleImport()` function (lines 90-121) handles the full import:\n1. Reads the file as text (line 94)\n2. Parses CSV using custom parser (line 95)\n3. Maps CSV columns to API fields using `headerMap` (lines 101-108)\n4. Sends parsed data via POST to `apiEndpoint` with `apiBodyKey` (lines 109-112)\n5. Displays results with success count and error messages (lines 114-116)\n\n### 5. Component Props\n\nThe component accepts these required props:\n- `entityName`: Singular entity name (e.g., \"Contact\")\n- `entityNamePlural`: Plural entity name (e.g., \"Contacts\")\n- `columns`: Array of column definitions with name, required flag, and description\n- `headerMap`: Maps CSV headers to API field names\n- `templateFilename`: Downloaded template filename\n- `templateExample`: Example data row for template\n- `apiEndpoint`: API URL for import submission\n- `apiBodyKey`: Key for the items array in request body"}],"totalDurationMs":13485,"totalTokens":18945,"totalToolUseCount":7,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3234,"cache_read_input_tokens":15011,"output_tokens":695,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3234},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

But this was likely addressed in another check directive phase. The current job is specifically about: 1) adding test entries and 2) writing playwright tests. I don't need to worry about JSX comments for this job - that's out of scope.\n\nLet me now also check if there's a `createReadStream` available for Playwright's download object. The Playwright API has `download.createReadStream()` which returns a `Promise<Readable | null>`. Let me make sure the test approach will work.\n\nActually, there's a simpler approach. I can use `download.path()` to get the path of the downloaded file and then read it. \n\nI'm weighing a few options here - `createReadStream()` works but requires handling the null case, while `download.path()` is more straightforward for reading the file directly. I'll go with the simpler path-based approach and update the test accordingly. I'm reconsidering whether to use `stream.toArray()` or fall back to manually collecting chunks with a for-await loop, but actually `download.path()` with `fs.readFileSync()` is cleaner since the file should be fully written by that point. Let me verify that the download is complete before reading... I need to check what's already imported in the test file before adding `fs`. The simplest approach would be using `download.path()` with `fs.readFileSync`, but I'm concerned about null returns if the download fails.
