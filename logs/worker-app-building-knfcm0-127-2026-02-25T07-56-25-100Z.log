There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    69→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    70→\n    71→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    72→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"299884ae-edba-4bed-adde-4df863fce808","uuid":"38437d04-2c89-4120-8bf6-71ba254e0fbb","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"299884ae-edba-4bed-adde-4df863fce808","uuid":"6caf90a4-58a5-4db5-bf52-94cdd086b249","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

[2026-02-25T07:54:10.618Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01LDRWd4nVYuUZ95FC9yHziT","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the entire codebase. Let me now write all four components. Let me start with the TransactionHeader component.\n\nLooking at the tests, I need:\n\n**TransactionHeader:**\n- Transaction ID as large heading: \"Transaction ID: TXN-123456\"\n- Status badge: green for \"Completed\", yellow/amber for \"Pending\", red for \"Voided\" - but wait, the Transaction type has status as \"posted\", \"draft\", \"void\". But the tests say \"Completed\", \"Pending\", \"Voided\". The data model says `status: \"posted\" | \"draft\" | \"void\"`. \n\nSo I need to map the status values: \"posted\" displays as \"Completed\" in green, \"draft\" displays as \"Pending\" in yellow/amber, and \"void\" displays as \"Voided\" in red. The header also needs to show the date and time formatted as \"Oct 26, 2023, 10:30 AM PST\", include the creator's name, display a description, and render a breadcrumb navigation with Home and Transactions links that navigate to / and /transactions respectively, while the sidebar marks Transactions as the active section.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the transaction ID shown in the header is the `id` field or the `reference_id` — the test data shows \"TXN-123456\" as the main identifier, but I need to verify how the TransactionsHistoryTable displays transactions since it uses a fallback pattern with `reference_id` or a substring of `id`.\n\nFor the status display, I'm mapping the database values to user-facing labels: \"posted\" displays as \"Completed\" with green styling, \"draft\" as \"Pending\" with yellow, and \"void\" as \"Voided\" with red — the test descriptions are referring to these display labels rather than the raw status values. Looking at the existing CSS variables in index.css, I can see the color scheme is already defined for each status—posted uses green, draft uses yellow/amber, and void uses a muted tone. So I need to map the internal status values to user-facing labels that match the test expectations: \"posted\" displays as \"Completed\" in green, \"draft\" as \"Pending\" in yellow, and \"void\" as \"Voided\" in the muted color. I need to create a mapping function that translates the database status values to their display equivalents and corresponding badge classes, then build out the components using these mappings. Writing the component structure... Building the transaction details section... I'm closing out the component and now reconsidering what the test expects—it looks like the transaction ID displayed in the header should be \"TXN-123456\", which could be either the `id` field or the `reference_id` depending on how the test data is structured. Let me trace through what the test is actually checking to figure out which field to use. Looking at the page structure from the mockup, I need to build out the header, basic info section, and two tables. Checking my subtasks, I notice BasicInfoSection isn't listed as a separate component to write—it might already exist or be part of the page itself. Let me verify what I actually need to implement versus what's already available. I need to create BasicInfoSection as its own component file since the spec requires all JSX on a page to be abstracted into separate components. Now I'm starting with the TransactionHeader component and reviewing what the test expects for the heading text format.\n\nFor the status badge, there's a mismatch between the test expecting \"Completed\" with green styling and our Transaction type which only allows \"posted\", \"draft\", or \"void\" — I need to figure out whether the test data actually uses a different status value or if there's a mapping layer I'm missing. I'm confident the test seed data will use the actual database values—\"posted\", \"draft\", \"void\"—while the test descriptions use human-readable labels for clarity. So I need to map these: \"posted\" displays as \"Completed\" in green, \"draft\" as \"Pending\" in yellow, and \"void\" as \"Voided\" in red, using the corresponding badge CSS classes. Now I'm ready to start building the components, beginning with the TransactionHeader that should display the transaction ID in the format \"Transaction ID: TXN-123456\".\n\nLooking at the Transaction interface, I see the id field for the transaction ID, and I need to figure out which date field to use for the \"Date/Time\" display. The test expects \"Oct 26, 2023, 10:30 AM PST\", which is a full datetime, so I'll likely use the `created_at` timestamp field rather than just the `date` field.\n\nFor the description field, the test shows it should display the transaction description directly. Now I need to check how the NavigationHeader component handles the active state for the Transactions link on this detail page.\n\nLooking at the existing logic, the path `/transactions/:transactionId` starts with `/transactions`, so the nav link will automatically be marked as active. That test is already covered.\n\nNow I'm building the TransactionHeader component with a breadcrumb navigation, status label mapping, and formatted date display... Building the transaction header layout... Writing component markup... I'm reviewing the transfer row structure more carefully—the source amount should show as negative units with a down arrow for debits, and I need to make sure the source batch ID displays as a clickable link when present or \"N/A\" as plain text when missing, then the destination side mirrors this with the opposite direction indicator and positive amount. Now I'm looking at the QuantityTransfer interface to understand how the amounts map to the directional arrows. The amount field represents the transferred quantity, and in a double-entry system, the source account shows a negative amount with a down arrow (debit/outflow) while the destination account shows a positive amount with an up arrow (credit/inflow). So for a 500-unit transfer, the source displays -500 with ↓ and the destination displays +500 with ↑.\n\nBut I'm noticing something odd in the test case—the second transfer shows the expense account as the source with a positive amount and up arrow, while the destination asset account has a negative amount and down arrow. That seems inverted from what I'd expect, so I need to reconsider how the sign convention actually works here.\n\nLooking at the pattern, it appears the arrows are simply tied to the sign of the amount itself, not to whether it's a source or destination. And since each transfer only has a single `amount` field in the data model, I need to figure out how that one value maps to both the source and destination amounts shown in the UI. I'm realizing the amount field might be stored differently than I initially thought—maybe it's a single value that gets applied with opposite signs depending on whether an account is the source or destination. Let me trace through the actual data to understand how the test expects the amounts to be calculated from that single `amount` field. I think the display logic is:\n- Source Amount = -(amount) ... the source account loses the material\n- Destination Amount = +(amount) ... the destination account gains the material\n\nFor row 1: amount = 500 → Source: -500, Destination: +500 ✓\nFor row 2: amount = ??? → Source: +15, Destination: -15\n\nThis doesn't work with a single `amount` field if source_amount is always -amount.\n\nMaybe the `amount` field can be negative? If amount = -15:\n- Source Amount = -(-15) = +15 ✓\n- Destination Amount = +(-15) = -15 ✓\n\nOK so if the amount is negative, the signs flip. That makes sense. In the second case, the amount is negative (-15), which means the source gets credited to the expense account and the warehouse gets debited.\n\nSo the display logic is straightforward: Source display = -amount and Destination display = amount. This handles both positive and negative amounts naturally, flipping the direction of flow when needed.\n\nFor the arrows, I'll use the displayed amount to determine direction: negative amounts show a down arrow in red/orange (debit), positive amounts show an up arrow in green/blue (credit).\n\nNow for the totals, I need to sum all the debits and credits separately. Debits are the negative displayed amounts, credits are the positive ones.\n\nLooking at the test data: Row 1 has a -500 debit and +500 credit, Row 2 has a +15 credit and -15 debit, giving me totals of 515 for both. The key insight is that every transfer creates equal debits and credits—they always balance because each transaction moves the same amount from one account to another. I need to step back and compute this directly from the displayed values instead. I'm writing a function that iterates through each transfer, extracts the source and destination amounts as they'd be displayed, and accumulates any negative values as debits.\n\nWriting the credits calculation...\n\nThen I'm testing this logic with the sample amounts to verify the totals balance correctly—both debits and credits should equal 515.\n\nBut wait, the test case shows debits of 500 and credits of 515, which means they're not equal. That contradicts my assumption that they should always balance. Let me reconsider what the amount field actually represents and how the double-entry accounting is supposed to work here. I need to figure out how debits and credits are actually calculated. Looking at the data more carefully, it seems like debits might be the sum of absolute values from source amounts, and credits from destination amounts—which would normally balance but could diverge in error cases like the unbalanced test expecting 500 vs 515. I'm realizing the amount field is probably always positive, with the source and destination columns handling the sign direction—so debits and credits would naturally balance. The unbalanced test case might just be using artificial data to test the UI rendering when values don't match. I'll implement a straightforward calculation where total debits equals the sum of all transfer amounts.\n\nImplementing the calculation... I think the `amount` field might be signed—positive for normal transfers and negative for reversals. So if the amount is positive, the source gets debited and the destination credited, but if it's negative, those flip. Let me check this against the test data where one row shows source +15 and destination -15, which would match a negative amount value.\n\nNow I'm writing the logic to calculate totals by iterating through transfers and accumulating debits and credits...\n\nActually, I realize this simplifies nicely—the total debits and credits will always be equal since they're just the sum of absolute values of all amounts.\n\nThe \"unbalanced\" test case is probably just for UI rendering purposes, even though it shouldn't happen with real data. But I should still handle the case where they differ, which could occur if there are data errors or if transfers are somehow one-sided. Let me reconsider the accounting logic: in double-entry bookkeeping, debits and credits should always balance, but since each transfer only has a single amount field, maybe the system allows source and destination amounts to differ, which would represent an error condition.\n\nActually, since the model only stores one amount per transfer, debits and credits will always be equal—the \"unbalanced\" test is just checking how the UI behaves in that hypothetical scenario. I'll still implement the equality check by summing the absolute amounts from the source and destination columns.\n\nNow I'm ready to write the code. For the QuantityTransfersTable, I'll follow the existing section-card pattern. Then for BatchesCreatedTable, I need a simpler structure with columns for Batch ID (which should be clickable), Material, and Quantity.\n\nThe TransactionDetailPage will compose these tables along with a TransactionHeader and a new BasicInfoSection component. For BasicInfoSection, I need to display read-only fields for date, reference ID, description, and transaction type in a responsive grid layout, with the date formatted as MM/DD/YYYY.\n\nNow I'm checking how the existing TransactionsHistoryTable handles transaction display to ensure consistency with the new components I'm
