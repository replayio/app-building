This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify).

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}

I need to count the RequestPage entries. Let me count them:\n\n### WizardStepper (5 entries):\n1. WizardStepper: Displays three labeled steps\n2. WizardStepper: Step 1 active on initial load\n3. WizardStepper: Step 1 completed and Step 2 active during assessment\n4. WizardStepper: Steps 1 and 2 completed and Step 3 active on confirmation\n5. WizardStepper: Steps are not clickable for navigation\n\n### DescribeAppForm (9 entries):\n\n\nThe form displays input fields for app name, description, and requirements on the first step, with users able to type into each field. Validation requires both the app name and description to be filled, and successful submission advances to the assessment step while persisting the data in the request summary.\n\n### AssessmentScreen (5 entries):\n1. Assess\n\nDuring assessment, a loading state displays alongside the request summary, with a progress bar animating while the system evaluates the policy. The flow then branches to either rejection or acceptance based on the policy outcome.\n\n### RejectionResult (5 entries):\n1. RejectionResult: Displays rejection heading with warning icon\n2. RejectionResult: Displays rejection context message\n3. RejectionResult: Displays reason for rejection box\n4. RejectionResult: Edit Request button visible and styled\n5. RejectionResult: Edit Request button navigates back to step 1\n\n### AcceptanceResult (8 entries):\n1. AcceptanceResult: Displays success heading with checkmark icon\n2. AcceptanceResult: Displays success context message\n3. AcceptanceResult: Displays Next Steps section\n4.\n\nNow I'm looking at the remaining acceptance result entries. The Go to AppPage button should be visible and styled, then navigate to the new app's page. There's also a View all My Apps link that takes users back to the main page, and the accepted app should appear in the Queued tab. Let me recount the total entries across all components to verify against the 27-entry requirement. Looking at WizardStepper, it should display the three steps with proper state transitions as users progress through the flow. The RejectionResult button is styled and navigates back to step 1. For AcceptanceResult, I'm seeing the success state with a checkmark, context message, Next Steps section, and navigation buttons to both the new app's page and back to My Apps, where the accepted app should appear in the Queued tab.

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01QFQXZJZ4ERVvnwrDt46iE6","session_id":"025d2570-eac8-4445-af3e-8dd42e6350f9","uuid":"fef458f4-850f-493f-935b-e1df4b7a9e57"}

WRITETEST.MD SKILL FILE GUIDELINES\n\nKey directives from `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`:\n\n1. **Test Navigation Precisely**: Verify URL or page content after clicks, not just that handlers exist\n2. **Use data-testid Consistently**: All data-testid values must match across test files\n3. **Avoid getByText() Ambiguity**: Use getByTestId for precise targeting, especially for common words\n4. **Test Side Effects**: For actions producing side effects (API calls), verify both primary effect and side effect, assert side effect happens exactly once\n5. **Mock Setup Pattern**: Use `page.route()` to intercept network requests and return mock data\n6. **Timeouts**: Use generous timeouts (10000-30000ms) for assertions, especially with Replay browser\n7. **Assertion Best Practices**: \n   - Avoid nested auto-wait calls in `.toPass()` blocks\n   - Use locator chaining (`.filter()`) instead\n   - Prefer atomic assertions with built-in retry\n8. **Test Parallel Design**: Tests run in parallel with isolated databases; don't hardcode IDs or assume fixed counts\n9. **Avoid Unnecessary Cleanup**: Don't add redundant cleanup in beforeEach when fresh context per test is provided\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nYou now have everything needed to write the RequestPage test file:\n- Complete understanding of all 5 components (RequestPage, WizardStepper, DescribeAppForm, AssessmentScreen, RejectionResult, AcceptanceResult)\n- All data-testid values and their purposes\n- Complete test specifications with expected behavior\n- API endpoint details and validation logic\n- Redux state management flows\n- Playwright configuration and testing patterns from existing tests\n- Guidelines from the skill file for writing comprehensive, maintainable tests\n\nAll file paths are absolute paths as required."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a42a455f2c8f36b12 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 72323\ntool_uses: 28\nduration_ms: 60199</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"025d2570-eac8-4445-af3e-8dd42e6350f9","uuid":"63ed7a73-c564-47c2-913a-f9f446820b97","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the LoopBuilder app at /repo/apps/LoopBuilder to understand its structure for writing Playwright tests.

WRITETEST.MD SKILL FILE GUIDELINES\n\nKey directives from `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`:\n\n1. **Test Navigation Precisely**: Verify URL or page content after clicks, not just that handlers exist\n2. **Use data-testid Consistently**: All data-testid values must match across test files\n3. **Avoid getByText() Ambiguity**: Use getByTestId for precise targeting, especially for common words\n4. **Test Side Effects**: For actions producing side effects (API calls), verify both primary effect and side effect, assert side effect happens exactly once\n5. **Mock Setup Pattern**: Use `page.route()` to intercept network requests and return mock data\n6. **Timeouts**: Use generous timeouts (10000-30000ms) for assertions, especially with Replay browser\n7. **Assertion Best Practices**: \n   - Avoid nested auto-wait calls in `.toPass()` blocks\n   - Use locator chaining (`.filter()`) instead\n   - Prefer atomic assertions with built-in retry\n8. **Test Parallel Design**: Tests run in parallel with isolated databases; don't hardcode IDs or assume fixed counts\n9. **Avoid Unnecessary Cleanup**: Don't add redundant cleanup in beforeEach when fresh context per test is provided\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nYou now have everything needed to write the RequestPage test file:\n- Complete understanding of all 5 components (RequestPage, WizardStepper, DescribeAppForm, AssessmentScreen, RejectionResult, AcceptanceResult)\n- All data-testid values and their purposes\n- Complete test specifications with expected behavior\n- API endpoint details and validation logic\n- Redux state management flows\n- Playwright configuration and testing patterns from existing tests\n- Guidelines from the skill file for writing comprehensive, maintainable tests\n\nAll file paths are absolute paths as required."}],"totalDurationMs":60199,"totalTokens":72323,"totalToolUseCount":28,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1450,"cache_read_input_tokens":66623,"output_tokens":4249,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1450},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me write the request-page.spec.ts file.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The form submits to `/.netlify/functions/request` via POST\n2.

The assessment transitions happen through Redux thunk states (pending -> fulfilled)\n5. I need to mock the API endpoint for different scenarios\n\nLet me count the test spec entries for RequestPage again more carefully:\n\nWizardStepper:\n\n\n1. Displays three labeled steps\n2. Step 1 active on initial load\n3. Step 1 completed and Step 2 active during assessment\n4. Steps 1 and 2 completed and Step 3 active on confirmation\n5. Steps are not clickable for navigation\n= 5\n\nDescribeAppForm:\n1. Displays form fields on step 1\n2. User can type into App Name field\n3. User can type into Description field\n4. User can type into Requirements field\n5. Submit button visible and labeled\n6. Validation requires App Name\n7. Validation requires Description\n8. Successful submission advances to Assessment step\n= 8\n\nThe form data carries through to the assessment screen where the request summary stays visible. During assessment, I'm showing a loading state with an animated progress bar that either transitions to a rejection screen if the policy check fails or an acceptance screen if it passes. The rejection screen displays a warning icon with the rejection reason and an edit button to go back to the form. The acceptance screen shows a success state with a checkmark, next steps section, and buttons to navigate to the new app's page or view all apps.\n\nI'm counting 32 test entries total across all components, but the task mentions 27—I'll write tests for all of them anyway. Now I need to set up the mock for the request endpoint to handle both acceptance and rejection responses depending on which flow I'm testing.\n\nWriting the test file...","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2379,"cache_read_input_tokens":58985,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2379,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"025d2570-eac8-4445-af3e-8dd42e6350f9","uuid":"228dedea-5999-4ff3-b990-2694ed117127"}

This is the single entry point for running\ntests during development and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n   previous runs.\n\n2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n\n3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n\n4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n   test data.\n\n5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n   prior runs.\n\n6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n   `DATABASE_URL`. Pipe all Playwright output to a log file (see Outputs).\n\n7. **Parse results**: Count passed/failed/skipped tests from the Playwright JSON reporter output\n   at `test-results/results.json`.\n\n8. **On failure** (non-zero exit code):\n   a. Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n   b. Append full metadata for every recording that has test metadata to the log file in a\n      delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, append `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` to the\n      log file. On failure, log the exit code.\n\n9. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n10. **Print summary** to stdout: a single line like `10 passed` or\n    `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`. Include the uploaded recording ID\n    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n\n11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed).

Never verbose test output.\n- **`logs/test-run-N.log`**: Full Playwright output, recording metadata, and upload results.\n  `N` increments each run (find the highest existing number and add 1).\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion.
