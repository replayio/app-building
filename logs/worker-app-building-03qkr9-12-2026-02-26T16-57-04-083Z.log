The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports. Budget information is visible or accessible for each account, including an overall budget for the account and budgets for specific items (for example, big or notable expenses), potentially displayed as inline indicators or links to more detailed budget views.\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdjq4Pw1UektSnylW57BEZobPcKpDY4LHifIMz\n     9→\n    10→2.

Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3.

This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\\n\\nKey directories:\\n\\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\\n  the work currently being done.\\n\\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\\n\\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\\n\\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\\n   whose name matches the user's request.\\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\\n\\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\\n\\n## Worker Execution\\n\\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\\n\\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\\n\\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically.

The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports.

Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n    15→   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

Account Category Filter Pre-Configuration from AccountDetailPage\n\n**When the dialog opens from AccountDetailPage with a pre-selected report type:**\n\nThe account category filter is **NOT pre-configured with the relevant category**. Here's what actually happens:\n\n- In `ReportingLinks.tsx` (lines 16-19), when either \"Actual vs Budget Report\" or \"Transaction History Report\" is clicked on AccountDetailPage, the dialog opens with:\n  - `defaultType` set to either `\"budget_vs_actual\"` or `\"detailed\"`\n  - `defaultAccountName` set to the current account name (e.g., \"Checking Account\")\n\n- In `CreateReportDialog.tsx` (line 24), the category filter is **always initialized with ALL subcategories checked**:\n  ```typescript\n  const [subCategoryState, setSubCategoryState] = useState(buildDefaultCategoryState);\n  ```\n\n- The `buildDefaultCategoryState()` function in `categoryTree.ts` (lines 60-68) sets **all 12 subcategories to `true`** without any filtering:\n  - Assets: Current, Fixed, Other\n  - Liabilities: Current, Long-Term\n  - Equity: Owner's, Retained Earnings\n  - Revenue: Operating, Non-Operating\n  - Expenses: Operating, Cost of Goods Sold, Non-Operating\n\n**The account name IS used** - only in the report name generation (line 42-44), not for filtering. The generated report name becomes: `\"Budget vs Actual - Checking Account\"` (for example).\n\n### 2. Column Headers for Each Report Type\n\n**Budget vs. Actual (Comparison)** - 5 columns:\n1.

Let me understand the three fixes:\n\n1. **Line 608**: \"The account category filter may be pre-configured to include the relevant category for the Main Checking account.\" - This is ambiguous. Based on the code, the account category filter is NOT pre-configured; all categories remain checked. The account name is used only in the report name generation. I need to replace this with the exact behavior.\n\n2. **Line 881**: \"which may show different columns or aggregation levels than the budget vs. actual view\" - This is ambiguous. The Summary Overview report shows 4 columns: Category/Account, Budget, Actual, Variance (without Variance %). \n\nFor the third fix, I need to add a test that verifies the \"Detailed Transactions\" report gets pre-selected when navigating from AccountDetailPage, similar to the existing test for the \"Actual vs Budget Report\" link. I should also check the ReportPreview code to confirm the exact column differences between these views.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1322,"cache_read_input_tokens":31213,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1322,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8676e74e-a02e-43b9-9555-7a328da01ac0","uuid":"6d9d0af8-bd08-46fd-9239-cc1fadf82397"}

Let me confirm:\n\n1. **Line 608 fix**: The \"may be pre-configured\" part is wrong. The category filter is always initialized with all categories checked (line 24 shows `buildDefaultCategoryState` which checks all categories). The account name is only used in the report name generation. So the exact behavior is:\n   - Dialog opens with \"Budget vs. Actual (Comparison)\" pre-selected\n   - All account categories remain checked (default state)\n   - The generated report name includes the account name (e.g., \"Budget vs Actual - Main Checking\")\n   \n2. **Line 881 fix**: The column difference between report types is concrete—Summary Overview displays four columns (Category / Account, Budget, Actual, Variance) while Budget vs. Actual adds a fifth column for Variance %, so switching between them changes the visible columns.\n\n3. **Missing test**: I should add a test for the Detailed Transactions pre-selection when clicking the \"Transaction History Report\" link, mirroring the structure of the line 605-608 test.\n\nNow I'm checking the existing account detail page tests to verify how the Detailed Transactions pre-selection is currently being tested.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1213,"cache_read_input_tokens":34901,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1213,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8676e74e-a02e-43b9-9555-7a328da01ac0","uuid":"9d3e7e1b-bb1e-4433-985e-d243b3d65169"}
