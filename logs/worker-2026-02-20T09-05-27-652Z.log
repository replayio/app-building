Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it contains subsequent changes to the spec from bug reports and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

Let me systematically work through each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecUsersListPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in UsersListPage test entries\n\nI need to check the UsersListPage test entries (section 9 in docs/tests.md) against the testSpec.md directives.\n\nThe UsersListPage section is:\n\n```\n## 9. UsersListPage (/users)\n\n### Components\n- **UsersPageHeader**: \"Team Members\" title with Users icon\n- **User Cards**: Grid of user cards showing avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. \n\nClicking a card navigates to /users/:userId.\n\n### Test Entries\n\n#### UsersPageHeader\n\n**ULP-HDR-01: Users page displays header and team members**\n- Initial: User navigates to /users\n- Action: Observe the page\n- Expected: Page header (data-testid=\"users-page-header\") shows \"Team Members\" title. Users grid (data-testid=\"users-grid\") displays user cards with names, emails, deal counts, and task counts.\n\n**ULP-HDR-02: Clicking a user card navigates to user detail page**\n- Initial: User is on /users with team members listed\n- Action: Click on a user card\n```\n\nNow I'm looking at the test entries to identify which ones might violate the testSpec.md directives about test structure and naming conventions. a user card\n- Expected: App navigates to /users/:userId. The user detail page displays the selected user's name, email, and activity sections.\n\nNow I'm checking the test specifications against the mockup directives. The component shows avatars, names, emails, deal counts, and task counts on each card, and ULP-HDR-02 correctly specifies the navigation target. I should verify whether individual elements like the avatar need their own test entries, and I'm noting that the header's \"Team Members\" title with the Users icon should be tested for appearance as well.\n\nLooking at the component structure, ULP-HDR-02 is really testing the User Cards component behavior rather than the header itself, so it might belong under a different component grouping.\n\nI should also verify that the JSX files have comments linking each interactive element to its corresponding test entries, as the directive requires. The page is straightforward enough—just a header and card grid—so the existing tests seem adequate. Now I need to examine the actual component code to check for any writeApp.md violations, then review the test file against writeTests.md

The testSpec.md directive says: \"Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\"\n\nLet me now systematically check all three jobs.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecUsersListPage\n\nLooking at the testSpec.md directives against the UsersListPage test entries in docs/tests.md (section 9):\n\n**UsersListPage Test Entries:**\n- ULP-HDR-01: Users page displays header and team members\n\n\n- ULP-HDR-02: Clicking a user card navigates to user detail page\n\nNow checking the testSpec.md directives. The first one about inconsistent styling across pages doesn't apply here. For the second directive about inventorying every visible element, the UsersListPage is fairly straightforward — I need to account for the Users icon, \"Team Members\" title, and the user cards themselves which contain avatars, names, emails, active deals counts, and open tasks counts.\n\nThe coverage looks reasonable for such a simple page. I'm noticing that while the tests do capture the header and card contents, there's a gap in explicitly verifying the Users icon appearance that's mentioned in the component description but not actually tested in ULP-HDR-01. The other directives check out — no data mutations to worry about, and the navigation target is properly specified.\n\nThere's also a structural issue where ULP-HDR-02 tests the User Cards component but it's filed under the UsersPageHeader section rather than having its own dedicated test entry area. And I should verify that every interactive element on the page actually has corresponding test coverage. I'm realizing the core issue: ULP-HDR-02 tests the User Cards component but is organized under UsersPageHeader instead of having its own section—that's a structural violation of the testSpec requirements. And while ULP-HDR-01 covers the main card elements like names and emails, it doesn't explicitly verify the avatar, which is a visible element that should be inventoried.\n\nNow I'm checking the actual component implementation to see if the test coverage matches what's claimed. The card has testids for the card itself and the name, but not for email, deal counts, or task counts. The test only verifies cards are present and there are at least 5 of them, but doesn't validate the individual content that the expected behavior says should be there—names, emails, deal counts, and task counts.\n\nMoving on to check the UsersListPage component against the writeApp.md directives...\n\nthe components appear to follow the spec, the visual layout matches the mockup, and I'm verifying that all interactive elements and containers have proper testids for E2E testing—the page container, header, grid, and individual cards all have them, though I'm still checking if every field within each card is properly tagged. - Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links ✅\n- Native HTML select elements should be avoided ✅\n- Attachment displays need file-type-specific icons ✅\n- File uploads must be fully functional ✅\n- There's a requirement about JSX comments next to interactive elements documenting which tests exercise them, and I need to figure out who's responsible for adding these comments and whether they should already exist in the component code.\n\nLooking at the actual components, UsersListPage.tsx has an interactive card element with an onClick handler but no JSX comment referencing the relevant test. That's a violation I need to address.\n\nFor the layout-agnostic components rule, UsersListPage.tsx has padding on its root div, though I'm checking whether this applies since it's a page-level component rather than a reusable component. reusable component. The UsersPageHeader has `className=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-6\"` - the `mb-6` is margin which the directive says should not be in the component. But is a page header within a page really violating this? It's a bit borderline. Let me look at how other page headers handle this...\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully, the directive says \"Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (px-*) or margin in component root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing.\" UsersPageHeader has `mb-6` on its root element. This IS a violation of the directive - the parent (UsersListPage) should control the spacing between the header and the grid.\n\nNow checking the test file against the writeTests.md directives. The playwright test titles match their entries exactly. For navigation assertions, I'm seeing proper URL verification across the tests - ULP-HDR-02 checks for the user detail URL pattern, UDP-HDR-02 checks the users list URL, and both UDP-DL-01 and UDP-TSK-01 verify both URL and content after navigation. There aren't any side-effect-producing actions in these tests to worry about. Looking at the getByText usage now... Looking at the record count assertion in ULP-HDR-01, it's using a relative check with `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(5)` rather than a fixed count, which is the right approach. The `.count()` call gets a snapshot at that moment, and since it's not wrapped in a `.toPass()` retry block, it avoids the timing issues that would come with auto-waiting semantics.\n\nThere's a coverage gap though—the test spec says cards should display names, emails, deal counts, and task counts, but the test only verifies that cards exist without checking their actual content. The file also mixes UsersListPage and UserDetailPage tests together, which is fine since they're related, and the tests consistently use data-testid for element identification throughout.\n\nLooking at the actual violations, I found two issues in testSpec.md and writeApp.md: ULP-HDR-02 is filed under the wrong section—it tests clicking a User Card but lives under UsersPageHeader instead of having its own User Cards section. In the implementation, the clickable user card divs lack JSX comments referencing the test, and UsersPageHeader's root element has a margin class that violates the layout-agnostic component principle.\n\nFor writeTests.md, ULP-HDR-01 expects verification of card content like names, emails, deal counts, and task counts, but the test only checks that cards exist and there are at least five of them—it should actually inspect at least one card's content to match the requirement.\n\nNow I'm identifying which violations warrant fix jobs. The testSpec organizational issue and missing JSX comments both stem from testSpec and component alignment, so they could be grouped together. The margin issue and the test content verification are separate problems with different root causes, so they should be their own fix jobs.\n\nActually, since these are all relatively small fixes
