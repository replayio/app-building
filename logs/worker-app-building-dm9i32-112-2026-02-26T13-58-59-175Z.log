This is the quality gate that must\n     6→pass before every commit.\n     7→\n     8→## Usage\n     9→\n    10→- `package.json` entry: `\"check\": \"tsx scripts/check.ts\"`\n    11→- No command-line arguments.\n    12→- No environment variables.\n    13→- **Run from the app directory** (e.g., `cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`), not from the\n    14→  repo root with standalone `npx tsc --noEmit`. Running from the app directory ensures the correct\n    15→  `tsconfig.json` is used and avoids resolution issues.\n    16→- Example: `cd /repo/apps/SalesCRM && npm run check`\n    17→\n    18→## Behavior\n    19→\n    20→1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to typecheck. Capture output to a log file.\n    21→2. Run `npx eslint . --fix` to lint with autofix. Capture output to the same log file.\n    22→3.

Overwritten each run.\n    35→- **Exit code 0**: both typecheck and lint passed.\n    36→- **Exit code 1**: typecheck or lint failed.\n    37→- Lint autofix may modify source files in place.\n    38→\n    39→## ESLint Configuration\n    40→\n    41→Before running lint, verify that the app has an ESLint configuration file (`.eslintrc.*` or\n    42→`eslint.config.*`). If no configuration exists:\n    43→- Either create a minimal ESLint config for the app before running lint, or\n    44→- Skip the lint step entirely.\n    45→\n    46→Do NOT retry `npx eslint` expecting different results when the underlying issue is a missing\n    47→configuration file. The \"no config found\" error will not resolve on its own.\n    48→\n    49→## Implementation Tips\n    50→\n    51→- Use `child_process.execSync` for each step.

This is the quality gate that must\npass before every commit.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"check\": \"tsx scripts/check.ts\"`\n- No command-line arguments.\n- No environment variables.\n- **Run from the app directory** (e.g., `cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`), not from the\n  repo root with standalone `npx tsc --noEmit`. Running from the app directory ensures the correct\n  `tsconfig.json` is used and avoids resolution issues.\n- Example: `cd /repo/apps/SalesCRM && npm run check`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to typecheck. Capture output to a log file.\n2. Run `npx eslint . --fix` to lint with autofix. Capture output to the same log file.\n3. Print a one-line summary to stdout:\n   - Success: `check passed`\n   - Failure: `check failed (typecheck|lint) — see logs/check.log`\n4. Exit with code 0 if both pass, 1 otherwise.\n\n## Inputs\n\nNone.\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: One-line summary only.\n- **`logs/check.log`**: Full typecheck and lint output. Overwritten each run.\n- **Exit code 0**: both typecheck and lint passed.\n- **Exit code 1**: typecheck or lint failed.\n- Lint autofix may modify source files in place.\n\n## ESLint Configuration\n\nBefore running lint, verify that the app has an ESLint configuration file (`.eslintrc.*` or\n`eslint.config.*`). If no configuration exists:\n- Either create a minimal ESLint config for the app before running lint, or\n- Skip the lint step entirely.\n\nDo NOT retry `npx eslint` expecting different results when the underlying issue is a missing\nconfiguration file. The \"no config found\" error will not resolve on its own.\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Use `child_process.execSync` for each step. Do NOT inherit stdio — pipe output to the log file.\n- Run typecheck first — no point linting if types are broken.\n- Overwrite `logs/check.log` each run (not append).\n","numLines":54,"startLine":1,"totalLines":54}}}
