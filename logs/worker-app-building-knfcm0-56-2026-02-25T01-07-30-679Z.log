Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    97→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    98→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    99→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   100→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   101→\n   102→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   103→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   104→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   105→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   106→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   107→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   108→\n   109→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   110→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   111→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   112→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   113→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   114→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   115→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   116→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   117→\n   118→## Parallel Test Design\n   119→\n   120→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   121→Write tests with this in mind:\n   122→\n   123→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   124→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   125→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   126→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   127→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   128→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   129→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   130→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   131→  being unmodified.\n   132→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   133→  you need to interact with.\n   134→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   135→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   136→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   137→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   138→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   139→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   140→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   141→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   142→\n   143→## Tips\n   144→\n   145→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   146→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   147→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   148→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   149→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   150→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   151→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   152→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   153→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   154→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c176e880-674f-4413-839f-45b4da28615e","uuid":"efc260f2-2544-499b-853b-b2f02cae8aa3","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":154,"startLine":1,"totalLines":154}}}

[2026-02-25T00:53:52.510Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_0165Qs4HybKBYp7ohYPYXsi7","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. Let me also check the seed data more carefully. The test specs reference different recipe names than what's in the seed data:\n\nTest specs reference:\n- \"Standard Widget Assembly\" with Product \"Widget X-100\", Version \"1.2\", Status \"Active\"\n- \"Deluxe Gadget Build\" with Product \"Gadget Pro\"\n- \"Eco-Pack Material Mix\" with Product \"Packaging Type C\"\n\nBut the seed data has:\n- 'Organic Granola Mix', 'Granola', '2.1', 'Active'\n\n\n- 'Protein Energy Bar', 'Energy Bar', '1.3', 'Active'\n- 'Fruit Preserve - Strawberry', 'Strawberry Jam', '3.0', 'Active'\n- 'Trail Mix Classic', 'Trail Mix', '1.0', 'Draft'\n- 'Almond Butter Smooth', 'Almond Butter', '1.5', 'Archived'\n\nThere's a clear mismatch here—the test specs are written for manufacturing and assembly recipes while the seed data contains food product recipes. The tests were probably written generically without accounting for what's actually in the database, so I'll need to either update the test data to match the seed data or vice versa.\n\nI'm going to align the tests with the actual seed data instead. For the search tests, I'll use names and products that actually exist—like searching for \"Energy Bar\" or \"Strawberry Jam\". For the table row verification tests, I'll reference real entries like \"Protein Energy Bar\" with its actual version and status. The badge tests can use \"Trail Mix Classic\" for the Draft status and any of the Active entries for the Active badge verification.\n\nFor the edit test, I'll modify \"Protein Energy Bar\" by changing its version number, and for the delete test, I'll use an Archived item that's less critical. The version display test will verify that \"Trail Mix Classic\" shows \"1.0 (Draft)\" correctly. Looking at the materials panel for \"Organic Granola Mix\", the seed data includes Rolled Oats at 50 kg, Honey at 10 kg, and Sunflower Oil at 5 kg.\n\nI'm realizing the test specs reference items like \"Standard Widget Assembly\" that don't actually exist in the seed data, so I need to align my test assertions with what's really there. The spec titles should match exactly, but the actual test logic needs to work with the real materials and products available. Let me review the spec again to understand what behaviors I'm actually testing versus what specific data I'm using. The spec explicitly names specific recipes like \"Standard Widget Assembly\", but since the actual seed data is different, I need to write tests that work with whatever recipes actually exist in the database rather than trying to force the spec's example data. Let me identify what recipes are actually seeded so I can write assertions against real data. I see the mismatch—the instructions in REC-PNL-9 are for widget assembly, not granola, so I need to use the actual recipe steps for Organic Granola Mix instead. The key insight is that tests should validate the data structure and behavior patterns rather than being tied to specific example values. For the pagination tests, I'm working with a page size of 5 and need to account for how many total records exist.\n\nSince the pagination component only renders when there's more than one page, and the current seed data has exactly 5 recipes with a PAGE_SIZE of 5, I need to generate additional recipes during test setup to actually trigger pagination visibility. I could either create these recipes as part of a beforeAll hook or dynamically within the test flow itself.\n\nFor the test file structure, I'm organizing everything under a single file at `apps/ProductionHub/tests/recipes-page.spec.ts` since all the components—RecipesHeader, RecipesTable, and RecipeDetailsPanel—live on the same /recipes page. I'll need to set up the Playwright config first, then organize the tests into describe blocks for each component with their respective test cases.\n\nSetting up test file structure... I'm reviewing the ingredient lists for each recipe—the granola mix needs several components like sunflower oil and almonds, the energy bars require protein powder and oat flour, the strawberry preserve uses fresh fruit and sugar, and the trail mix combines nuts, dried fruit, and chocolate chips.\n\nNow I'm checking the recipe instructions and materials across the seed data. All five recipes have instructions defined, but I notice that Almond Butter Smooth has no materials listed in the seed data, which is what I need for the empty materials test case.\n\nFor the empty instructions test, I could create a new recipe through the add form since it doesn't include an instructions field—any recipe created that way would have empty instructions. Looking at how the RecipeDetailsPanel displays these fields, a recipe without instructions would show \"No notes or instructions available\" in the Materials tab and \"No instructions available for this recipe\" in the Instructions tab.\n\nThe challenge is that all the seeded recipes with materials also have instructions, so for REC-PNL-10 I'd need to either create a test recipe with materials but no instructions through the API, or find another approach to handle this scenario. the create recipe flow: when you create a recipe via the Add Recipe modal, the API creates a recipe with just name, product, version, status - no instructions, no materials. If I then check that new recipe's Materials Breakdown tab, it would show the empty state (no materials), not the notes placeholder. That's REC-PNL-14, not REC-PNL-10.\n\nFor REC-PNL-10, the spec says \"a recipe that has no notes or instructions on the Materials Breakdown tab\" - this means a recipe with materials but no instructions. None of the seeded recipes fit this.\n\nThe issue is that REC-PNL-10 requires a recipe with materials but no instructions, which doesn't exist in the seed data. I could create one via the API by adding materials to a recipe without instructions, or I could reuse a recipe from another test like REC-HDR-13. But that recipe also won't have materials, so it would show the empty state instead of the notes section. I need to figure out how to actually test the scenario the spec describes. I'm seeing that the Notes & Instructions section only displays when there are materials but no instructions defined. Since none of the seeded recipes match this exact scenario, I could either modify the seed data or create a recipe through the test itself, but modifying seed data seems like the more pragmatic approach here rather than trying to work around the app's current implementation. Actually, I think the cleanest solution is to just add a recipe to the seed data that has materials but no instructions—that way I can properly test the placeholder behavior for REC-PNL-10 without relying on edge cases in the existing data. I need to find a recipe that has materials but no instructions to properly test the spec. Almond Butter Smooth already has full instructions, so modifying it would break other tests. Let me just create a new recipe in the seed data with materials but empty instructions—that way I can test the placeholder behavior without affecting existing test cases. I need to verify how the backend handles empty instruction strings—if it returns an empty string, the falsy check in the component will correctly trigger the placeholder. So I'll update the seed data to give Almond Butter Smooth empty instructions and add some materials to it. For the pagination tests, I realize that with only 5 recipes and a page size of 5, I can't test multiple pages, so I'll need to either expand the seed data or have the tests themselves create additional recipes to reach the threshold for pagination. the seed for a total of 11, which gives 3 pages with PAGE_SIZE=5. But wait—the spec says I should finish implementing the app if needed, though I shouldn't rely on modifying seed data for tests that should be self-contained. Let me instead keep the existing 5 seed recipes and have the pagination tests create their own records to avoid affecting other tests.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the specific recipe states I need: one with materials but no instructions for REC-PNL-10, and another with no instructions at all for REC-PNL-12, plus a recipe with no materials for REC-PNL-14's empty state test. I'm realizing I need to handle REC-PNL-10 and REC-PNL-12 differently—one needs materials without instructions, the other needs no instructions at all. Rather than juggling modifications, I'll add a new recipe with materials but empty instructions, which cleanly satisfies both requirements without breaking what already works for REC-PNL-14.\n\nAdding more recipes to hit 11+ total will also give me proper pagination across 3 pages with PAGE_SIZE=5. I'll seed a few food-related recipes like \"Basic Flour Blend\" and \"Cashew Butter\" to keep things consistent.\n\nActually, I'm overthinking this. The tests can just create recipes on the fly using the UI, and I only need to modify the seed data for the specific edge cases like materials without instructions. That's the minimal change approach. For REC-PNL-14, I need a recipe with no materials, but if I modify Almond Butter Smooth to have materials for REC-PNL-10, I'll lose that. I could create a new recipe through the Add Recipe form for REC-PNL-14, but then I'd have test dependencies which isn't ideal. Let me think about whether I can create a standalone recipe in the seed data that has no materials but does have instructions.\n\nActually, I've got a better approach: I'll keep the existing five recipes and modify Almond Butter Smooth by clearing its instructions and adding materials (Almonds and Salt). Then I'll add six new recipes for pagination testing—Honey Roasted Peanuts, Cashew Butter Creamy, Yogurt Bark Bites, Coconut Chips Toasted, Dried Mango Slices, and one more—each with simple materials and instructions, with one marked as Draft status.\n\nFor the final recipe, Mixed Seed Brittle will have no materials and no instructions, which covers the empty state scenarios I need to test across the Materials and Instructions tabs.\n\nNow I'm moving on to the REC-PNL-8 test case, which requires checking the Materials Breakdown tab with specific ingredient data. I'll swap in Organic Granola Mix and verify its actual materials list instead of using the Standard Widget Assembly example.\n\nFor REC-PNL-9, I need to confirm the Notes & Instructions text for Organic Granola Mix rather than relying on the spec's placeholder text about heating and safety protocols.\n\nI'm also thinking through which recipe to use for the delete tests—something like Almond Butter Smooth would work fine since the tests run in isolated database branches anyway.\n\nBefore I start writing the tests and updating the seed data, I should double-check whether I actually need to modify the seed data to handle pagination or if the existing setup is sufficient.\n\nLooking at this more practically, I can create records on-the-fly for pagination tests, but I do need the right recipes in place for REC-PNL-10, 12, and 14. So I'll update the seed to clear the instructions for Almond Butter Smooth, add materials to it, and include six more basic recipes—that should cover everything I need.\n\nNow I'm checking what the

[2026-02-25T00:55:07.495Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_0192jZVQt8PXYs2DHzY9p95v","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me plan:\n\n1. The seed data has 5 recipes - not enough for pagination tests (need > 5 with PAGE_SIZE=5)\n2. Need recipes with no instructions for REC-PNL-10, REC-PNL-12\n3. Need a recipe with no materials for REC-PNL-14 (Almond Butter Smooth already has no materials)\n\nMy plan:\n1. Update seed data to add more recipes (for pagination) and adjust one for empty instructions\n2. Create playwright.config.ts\n3. Create the test file\n\n\n4. I need to be careful with the seed data structure - I need two separate recipes with different missing fields: one with materials but no instructions, and another with no materials and no instructions. I'll add 6 more recipes to reach 11 total for proper pagination testing across 3 pages. I'm finishing out the recipe list with the remaining items—Dried Mango Slices, Mixed Seed Brittle (which has materials but no instructions, perfect for testing that edge case), and Pumpkin Spice Blend. That gives me 12 recipes total across 3 pages, and I need to make sure the active/draft/archived statuses are properly distributed for the filter tests. Now I'm verifying the filter functionality works correctly—8 active recipes, 2 drafts, and 2 archived items. The recipes are sorted alphabetically by name in the API, and I'm checking the pagination to ensure the list displays properly across pages.\n\nFor the search tests, I'm planning to validate that searching by recipe name finds \"Organic Granola Mix,\" searching by product name locates \"Protein Energy Bar,\" and clearing the search restores the full list.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the table tests—checking that each status badge displays correctly for active, draft, and archived recipes, verifying the edit functionality works by modifying a recipe's version, and for the delete tests, I'll create a dedicated test recipe rather than relying on one from the fixture data since tests run in parallel. a recipe first via the API, then delete it. But actually, since tests run against a seeded database with ephemeral branches per worker, I should leverage the existing seed data where possible. For the delete test, I'll create a recipe through the Add Recipe form at the start, then verify it gets removed. The edit test can use an existing recipe like \"Organic Granola Mix\" and change its version, though I'll need to decide whether to restore it afterward or accept the data modification.\n\nSince each worker gets its own database branch, modifying test data is fine. Now I'm ready to write the code—I need to update the seed data to add more recipes and set some instructions to empty strings, configure Playwright, and write the test file. The seed data changes involve clearing instructions for one recipe and adding several new ones with their materials. Path aliases won't be an issue since the tests interact with the browser directly rather than importing app code.\n\nLet me clarify the test data setup: Almond Butter Smooth needs empty instructions and no materials to cover two test cases, while Mixed Seed Brittle needs empty instructions but should have materials. I'll update the seed carefully to match these requirements.\n\nThe current seed uses a pattern where recipe inserts return IDs that get mapped to a lookup object for cross-referencing materials and equipment. I need to extend this same pattern to add the new recipes alongside the existing five, then draft the updated insert statement with all the recipe rows.\n\nExtending the seed insert... Generating the product data... I see there's a version display function that formats Draft recipes with their status appended. I need to find a recipe with version \"2.0.1\" and Draft status to match the spec—Yogurt Bark Bites would work for this, so I'll update it to have version \"2.0.1\" and status \"Draft\" instead.\n\nFor the test, I'll verify that Trail Mix Classic (which is Draft with version \"1.0\") displays as \"1.0 (Draft)\" in the Version column, which demonstrates the behavior works correctly. Now I need to add material entries for these recipes to complete the setup. Continuing with the ingredient lists...\n\nI'm noting that Almond Butter Smooth has no materials listed, and Mixed Seed Brittle is missing instructions despite having its ingredients defined. Now I'm moving into the product mappings for the new recipes, starting with items like Honey Roasted Peanuts and Cashew Butter Creamy.\n\nFinishing up the product entries...\n\nReady to generate all the files now.\n\nLet me review the router structure first to make sure everything connects

The default route is \"/\" which redirects to \"/recipes\". Now I have everything I need. Let me start writing.\n\nLet me now plan the full implementation:\n\n1. Update seed-db.ts - add 7 more recipes, materials for new ones, change Almond Butter Smooth instructions to ''\n2. Create playwright.config.ts\n3. Create tests/recipes-page.spec.ts\n\nLet me now write the test file. I'll structure it as:\n\n```typescript\nimport { test, expect } from \"@playwright/test\";\n\ntest.describe(\"RecipesHeader\", () => {\n  test(\"REC-HDR-1: Page title displays 'Recipes'\", ...);\n  test(\"REC-HDR-2: Search bar is displayed with placeholder text\", ...);\n  ...\n});\n\ntest.describe(\"RecipesTable\", () => {\n  test(\"REC-TBL-1: Table displays Recipe Name, Product, Version, Status, and Actions column headers\", ...);\n  ...\n});\n\ntest.describe(\"RecipeDetailsPanel\", () => {\n  test(\"REC-PNL-1: Side panel displays with recipe title\", ...);\n  ...\n});\n```\n\nNow I'm writing out each test case, making sure to use consistent data-testid attributes and reference the actual recipe names from the seed data.\n\nI need to be careful about avoiding hardcoded counts, using generous timeouts for reliability, and ensuring each test can run independently. For the header tests, I'll verify the page title and route using their test IDs, then check the search input has the right placeholder. For the search functionality, I'm testing that filtering by recipe name \"Granola\" shows only \"Organic Granola Mix\", and filtering by product \"Energy\" displays only the \"Protein Energy Bar\" recipe.\n\nActually, wait—I'm realizing the search logic matches both name and product fields, so \"Energy\" would match \"Protein Energy Bar\" by name too. I need to pick a search term that uniquely identifies a recipe by product only. Looking at the product names available, I should find one that doesn't appear in any recipe names to avoid ambiguity. I see the spec is specifically about searching by product name, not recipe name. So if I search for \"Jam\", it should only match the product \"Strawberry Jam\" and display just the \"Fruit Preserve - Strawberry\" recipe. Let me verify this is the right test case for the search functionality.\n\nNow I'm moving on to test the status filter dropdown, which should default to showing all recipes. I need to check that the filter button displays the correct label, then verify I can click it to see the available options like Active, Draft, and Archived, and that selecting each one properly filters the recipe list accordingly.\n\nI'm also testing that the Add Recipe button works end-to-end—filling out the form, submitting it, and confirming the new recipe persists when I navigate away and return. Then I'll verify that search and filter work together, like filtering for Active recipes while searching for \"Granola\" to get only the matching result.\n\nFinally, I'm checking the table itself—verifying the column headers display correctly, that each row shows the right data, and that the status badges render with the appropriate colors (green for active, yellow for draft, gray for archived), plus the edit icon and its associated form functionality.\n\nNow I'm moving through the delete functionality—testing the trash icon, the confirmation dialog, and the cancel option—then checking that clicking a row opens a detail panel and highlights the selected row. I'm also validating the pagination controls work properly, including the page number display, first/previous/next/last buttons, and that the navigation buttons disable appropriately at the boundaries.\n\nFor the panel itself, I need to verify the title updates when selecting different recipes, and that all three tabs—General Info, Materials Breakdown, and Instructions—display their respective content correctly, including the recipe details, materials table with headers and data, and the notes and instructions sections with proper empty states.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the test data structure: the recipes are alphabetically sorted by the API with pagination at five items per page, so I need to account for which recipes appear on which pages when writing tests that target specific ones like \"Organic Granola Mix\" on page 2 or \"Trail Mix Classic\" on page 3. Mix Classic\" (Draft, page 3) → need to navigate to page 3\n- \"Almond Butter Smooth\" (Archived, page 1)\n\nThis complicates some tests since the recipe I want to interact with may not be on page 1. Options:\n1. Search for the specific recipe before interacting\n2. Navigate to the right page\n3. Use recipes on page 1\n\nFor simplicity, many tests can use recipes on page 1. Let me reconsider which recipes go where.\n\nLooking at the full alphabetical list across all three pages, I see that most of the recipes I need for testing are actually scattered across pages 2 and 3, which isn't ideal. I could either have tests search for recipes first, or I could rename some recipes to get the important ones onto page 1. Actually, using search is probably the cleaner approach here. For REC-TBL-4, the spec describes navigating to /recipes and finding a Draft recipe without mentioning filtering first, so I need the Draft recipe visible on the initial page load. Since Draft recipes are on page 3 with pagination, searching by name is the cleanest approach—I'll search for \"Trail Mix\" to surface Trail Mix Classic, and similarly search for \"Almond Butter\" to find the Archived recipe for REC-TBL-5.\n\nActually, I'm reconsidering—maybe I should adjust the test data instead so the key recipes appear on page 1 without needing search. If I keep the total recipes small enough, I can avoid pagination entirely or ensure the important ones are visible immediately. I'm thinking through the realistic approach here—most tests should just search for the recipe they need rather than relying on pagination to find it. That's how users would actually behave anyway. So I'll create 12 recipes total to have enough for meaningful pagination testing, keeping the original 5 and adding 7 new ones. Now I need to carefully update the seed data, starting with the recipes I'm keeping. Continuing through the product list, I see items 8 through 12 with their versions and statuses. Most have both instructions and materials, though Mixed Seed Brittle is missing instructions. I'm tallying up the active products to get a complete count across all statuses.\n\nNow I'm setting up test cases to verify the search and filtering functionality works correctly—checking that searching by recipe name or product name returns only the matching results, and validating that row data displays properly. Looking at the page 1 recipes in alphabetical order, I can see Cashew Butter Creamy is the first Active recipe I can use. Now I'm verifying the row data for each test case: Cashew Butter Creamy for the Active badge test, filtering to find Trail Mix Classic for the Draft badge test, and Almond Butter Smooth for the Archived badge test.\n\nFor the edit and delete operations, I'll use Cashew Butter Creamy from page 1, and for the delete test I'll need to create a new recipe first. For the panel tests, I'm searching for specific recipes like Organic Granola Mix and Mixed Seed Brittle to verify their content and note fields.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the test execution strategy—since tests run sequentially within a spec file but in parallel across workers with separate DB branches, I need to be careful about how I handle deletions. Rather than removing seeded recipes that might affect subsequent tests, I'll create temporary recipes specifically for the delete operations.\n\nFor the edit test, I'm going to use \"Coconut Chips Toasted\" since no other tests depend on its specific version, and I'll update it from \"1.0\" to \"1.1\". For the delete test, I'll create a unique recipe through the Add Recipe form and then delete that instead.\n\nLooking at the spec more carefully, REC-TBL-9 specifically mentions \"Eco-Pack Material Mix\" which doesn't exist in the seed data, so I'll need to create it at the start of that test before deleting it. The test implementation should match what the spec describes rather than relying on pre-existing data. For REC-TBL-10, I'll verify that cancelling the delete confirmation keeps the recipe intact.\n\nSince both tests involve deletion workflows, the cleanest approach is to have each test create its own temporary recipe—this keeps them independent and avoids any ordering dependencies. REC-TBL-10 can create a recipe, attempt to delete it, cancel the confirmation, and verify it still exists, while REC-TBL-9 creates a separate recipe and completes the deletion.\n\nActually, using seeded recipes would reduce overhead, but I need to be careful about test dependencies—if one test deletes a seeded recipe that another test in the same file needs, that could cause issues since tests run sequentially.\n\nLooking at which tests depend on \"Almond Butter Smooth\", I see it's needed for the archived badge test, instructions empty test, and materials empty test. So I can't use it for the delete tests. Instead, I'll use \"Pumpkin Spice Blend\" for deletion since it's archived and on page 2, and no other test specifically requires it. The archived filter test would still have \"Almond Butter Smooth\" to verify the filter works correctly.\n\nActually, I'm overthinking the test ordering and dependencies. Let me just create a temporary recipe specifically for deletion testing—that's the cleanest approach and avoids any fragile assumptions about test execution order.\n\nNow I'm ready to write out the full test file. I need to be careful with the test IDs and make sure my assertions are precise. One thing I'm noticing: the quantity field in the materials table comes back from the database as a number, so when React renders it, \"50.00\" becomes \"50\". I should account for that in my assertions rather than expecting the formatted decimal display. I think using `toContainText` for the quantity assertions would work well since I don't need to match the exact format.

The `quantity` column is `NUMERIC(15, 2)` which means neon might return it as a string like \"50.00\". When rendered in React as `{m.quantity}`, it would show \"50.00\" (if it's a string) or \"50\" (if it's a number). Let me assume the neon driver returns it as a string \"50.00\" since NUMERIC types are typically returned as strings for precision.\n\nActually, looking at the neon driver, by default it returns NUMERIC/DECIMAL as strings. So in JavaScript it would be the string \"50.00\". \n\nThere's a type mismatch here—the TypeScript definition says `quantity: number`, but the neon driver actually returns NUMERIC columns as strings, so the user would see \"50.00\" displayed in the browser regardless of what the type annotation claims.\n\nFor the tests, I'll use flexible text assertions that match both \"50\" and \"50.00\" to handle either case. Now I'm ready to write out the implementation files: I need to update the seed data to modify the Almond Butter Smooth recipe and add seven new recipes with their associated materials and products, then set up the Playwright configuration and test file. I'm looking at the scope here—I need to update the Almond Butter recipe's instructions and add seven new recipes with all their corresponding materials, products, and equipment entries across multiple INSERT statements. This is getting substantial, so let me think through whether it's worth adding that much seed data or if I should keep it simpler.\n\nActually, I realize the RecipesPage tests don't check products or equipment associations—those are only tested on the RecipeDetailsPage. So I can skip adding recipe_products and recipe_equipment for the new recipes and just focus on getting the recipes and their materials in place.\n\nLet me now write out the exact changes needed for the seed file. I need to clear the instructions for Almond Butter Smooth, add seven new recipes for pagination testing, and include materials for all of them.\n\nWriting seed file updates... Continuing with the product recipes, I'm seeing honey roasted peanuts that need blanching and a honey glaze before roasting, cashew butter that requires staged grinding with coconut oil, and yogurt bark bites that layer yogurt with fruit toppings on trays. Finishing up the dried mango recipe steps and moving through the remaining product entries to add their material requirements to the database. Defining the ingredient quantities for the remaining recipes... Adding product entries for the remaining recipes... Writing the test file... Writing test cases... I'm realizing the search might match both the recipe name and product field, so I need to verify the count is correct after the fill triggers the React onChange. Let me add a timeout to the count assertion to ensure the table has time to update before checking that only one result appears. Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Finishing the test assertions...\n\nI realize the Active filter will paginate with 8 active recipes across multiple pages, so I need to be careful about checking that specific draft and archived recipes don't appear—they might just be on a different page rather than filtered out.\n\nActually, since filtering happens before pagination, page 1 will show the first 5 active recipes alphabetically, and I can verify none of the known draft or archived recipe names appear on that page to confirm the filter is working correctly.\n\nNow I'm writing test cases for the Draft filter to ensure it shows only the 2 draft recipes... I'm realizing there's a potential issue with test isolation—earlier tests in the RecipesHeader describe block might create draft recipes that would show up in this filter test, throwing off my count assertions. Since describe blocks run sequentially in file order, if HDR-13 creates a \"Test Recipe\" with draft status before this test runs, I'd see more than the two recipes I'm expecting. I need to reconsider whether asserting exact counts is reliable here, or if I should adjust my approach to account for recipes created by previous tests. I think using relative assertions is the cleanest approach—I'll check for specific recipes and pagination behavior rather than exact counts. For tests like the all-recipes display, I can verify that the page shows the correct number of rows per page instead of worrying about total recipe counts. Let me map out the test ordering in the RecipesHeader block to see which tests actually modify data and which ones don't, so I can plan around the HDR-13 recipe creation.\n\nLooking at the sequence, HDR-13 is the first test that creates data—a Draft recipe called \"Test Recipe\"—which means from that point forward there are 13 recipes in the system instead of 12. This affects downstream tests like HDR-14, where the search and filter combination still works correctly because it's looking for \"Granola\" in the Active filter, which won't include the new Draft recipe. The RecipesTable tests will also see this extra Draft recipe, but I need to account for that in my assertions.\n\nWith 13 recipes total and 5 per page, pagination breaks down to 3 pages with 5, 5, and 3 recipes respectively. The \"Test Recipe\" starts with T, so it lands on page 3. For the pagination tests, I should use relative assertions to handle the dynamic count—checking that the page indicator shows the correct total pages rather than hardcoding specific numbers.\n\nI'm also noticing that some later tests like TBL-9 create and then delete recipes, so their net effect is zero. I need to track which tests actually leave data behind versus which ones clean up after themselves. ...so I'll use \"Almond Butter Smooth\" for TBL-10 since it's readily available on page 1, though I need to make sure I'm not interfering with the PNL tests that depend on it later.\n\nFor the delete test, I'll create a temporary recipe specifically for this purpose—something like \"TestDeleteRecipe_TBL9\"—then walk through the full deletion flow: adding it, searching for it, clicking delete, confirming, and verifying it's gone both immediately and after navigating away.\n\nFor TBL-10, I'll use one of the existing recipes already on the page and test that canceling the delete dialog leaves it untouched.\n\nNow I'm ready to write out the complete test file.\n\nFor locating recipe rows without knowing the database ID, I can use a filter on the data-testid attribute to find rows by their visible text content, then access the edit and delete buttons from that row using similar attribute selectors. The same approach works for finding status and version cells within a row.\n\nNow I'm structuring the test file with three main test suites for RecipesHeader, RecipesTable, and RecipeDetailsPanel. For the panel tests specifically, I need to navigate to the recipes page, search for a recipe to ensure it's visible, click the row to open the panel on the right side, wait for it to appear, and then test the tab interactions.\n\nFor the panel content tests, I'm deciding between using recipes from page 1 like \"Fruit Preserve - Strawberry\" which has materials data, or going to page 2 for \"Organic Granola Mix\" — but since \"Fruit Preserve - Strawberry\" already has the materials I need, I can stick with that for most tests and avoid the extra search and pagination steps. I'm mapping out the test cases using the Fruit Preserve - Strawberry recipe since it's readily available on page 1 with three materials, and I'll verify the panel heading updates correctly when switching between recipes like Cashew Butter Creamy to confirm the dynamic behavior works as expected. Almond Butter Smooth works for both the empty instructions test and the empty materials test since it has neither. For the notes empty scenario where materials exist but instructions don't, I need to search for Mixed Seed Brittle on page 2. Now I'm ready to start writing the test code, though I'm realizing I should verify what happens when a recipe is searched and clicked to ensure the panel loads correctly.\n\nThe panel uses `data-testid=\"recipe-details-panel\"` and the title uses `recipe-panel-title`, so I can wait for those to appear.

[2026-02-25T01:03:46.654Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Apyysg13EgQqosfSDkXrid","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a complete understanding. Let me write all the files now. I'll:\n\n1. Update seed-db.ts to add more recipes\n2. Create playwright.config.ts\n3. Create tests/recipes-page.spec.ts\n\nLet me start writing. First the seed data update, then config, then tests.\n\nFor the seed-db.ts, I need to carefully edit the existing file. The main changes:\n1. Change Almond Butter Smooth instructions from the long string to ''\n2. Add 7 new recipes to the recipes INSERT\n3. Add materials for the new recipes to the recipe_materials INSERT\n\n\n4. Add products for new recipes to recipe_products INSERT \n5. Add equipment associations for new recipes to recipe_equipment INSERT\n\nI'll need to use the Edit tool carefully since it requires exact string matching. Let me start with the recipes INSERT section, updating the Almond Butter Smooth entry and adding the seven new recipes after it.\n\nUpdating seed-db.ts... I'm replacing the Almond Butter Smooth recipe instructions with an empty string and adding seven new recipes including Honey Roasted Peanuts, Cashew Butter, and others with their respective details and preparation steps. Generating product database entries... Continuing to add the material entries for the remaining recipes... Finishing up the ingredient quantities for the spice blend and moving into the product output table... I'm continuing to populate the product inventory and recipe equipment mappings, adding entries for the remaining items like pumpkin spice blend and linking recipes to their required equipment like industrial mixers and packaging lines. I'm verifying that each edit target is unique across the file—the Almond Butter Smooth recipe, Trail Mix Classic Sunflower Seeds material, Almond Butter 250g Jar product, and Trail Mix Classic Packaging Line equipment all appear only once, so I can batch these changes together. Now I'm moving on to write the test file, being careful to avoid generic selectors like `getByText` with common words and instead relying on test IDs.\n\nWriting test file... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Continuing the test assertions...\n\nAfter clicking submit, I'm verifying the modal closes and the version updates to \"1.1\" in the table. Then I'm checking that the changes persist by navigating away and back to the recipes page, confirming the updated version is still there.\n\nNow I'm writing test cases for the delete functionality—first checking that the delete button appears in the Actions column, then testing that clicking it removes the recipe after confirmation. Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing pagination tests... Writing pagination tests... Writing test cases... Writing test cases... Writing test cases... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Finishing up the materials panel test by clicking the materials tab and verifying the empty state displays correctly with the appropriate message. Now I'm thinking through the test ordering—specifically whether the row selection test will still find \"Cashew Butter Creamy\" in the expected position after the previous edit and delete operations, but the sort order shouldn't be affected by those changes. order. TBL-9 creates and deletes \"TempDeleteRecipe\" so net zero. But wait, TBL-7 runs before TBL-12 in the file. After TBL-7 changes Coconut Chips Toasted version to \"1.1\", the recipe still exists with same name, so alphabetical order is unchanged. Good.\n\n2. For REC-TBL-11 (click opens panel), I use \"Fruit Preserve - Strawberry\" which is on page 1 (5th alphabetically). Good.\n\n3. For pagination tests (TBL-13 through 19), after HDR-13 creates \"Test Recipe\" (Draft), we have 13 recipes. 13/5 = 3 pages (5, 5, 3). The pagination tests should still work. Let me verify the page navigation: page 1 displays correctly, navigating between pages works, first/prev buttons disable on page 1, and next/last buttons disable on the final page which contains \"Trail Mix Classic\", \"Yogurt Bark Bites\", and \"Test Recipe\". All checks pass. Actually, I need to reconsider the database state after TBL-9 since it creates and deletes a recipe. Page 3 has 3 recipes, which checks out. For the empty field tests, \"Almond Butter Smooth\" works well since it has no instructions or materials in the seed data, and I'm not adding any. I need to verify whether the API returns `instructions` as an empty string or something else.\n\nLooking at the database schema, `instructions` is defined as `TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`, and the seed explicitly inserts empty strings. So when the API returns the recipe data, `instructions` will be an empty string, which JavaScript treats as falsy—meaning the placeholder text will display correctly. The RecipeDetailsPanel pulls the recipe from Redux via `fetchRecipeById`, which includes all the materials, products, and equipment. For \"Almond Butter Smooth\" with empty instructions and no materials, the Materials Breakdown tab shows an empty state and the Instructions tab shows the placeholder. \"Mixed Seed Brittle\" should behave similarly with its empty instructions.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the test flow for REC-TBL-12. After TBL-7 edits \"Coconut Chips Toasted\" and saves, the modal closes and the row name stays the same with only the version updated. But I need to verify that clicking a row to select it still works properly after the panel was opened in TBL-11, which opened the panel for \"Fruit Preserve - Straw\"...\n\nActually, each Playwright test gets a fresh browser context, so TBL-12 starts completely fresh when it navigates to /recipes. The database state persists between tests though, so the \"Test Recipe\" created earlier and the version change from TBL-7 are still there. That's what matters for the test flow.\n\nNow I'm checking whether pagination is properly handled for the filter tests—when the Active filter is applied with 8 Active recipes, I need to account for whether the \"Test Recipe\" counts as Draft or Active. Looking at the test cases, HDR-9 with the Draft filter should show 2 recipes before the new test recipe is created, and after HDR-13 adds \"Test Recipe\" in Draft status, the total count jumps to 13 recipes. For REC-TBL-17, I need to verify that \"Trail Mix Classic\" appears on the last page when all 13 recipes are sorted alphabetically. I'm verifying that the version change from TBL-7 persists in the database, so when TBL-12 loads fresh, it sees the updated \"1.1\" version for Coconut Chips Toasted—though that test doesn't actually validate the version number, just the row highlighting. Now I'm checking the row data assertions in TBL-2 to make sure they align with the pagination layout.\n\nFor TBL-9, I'm tracing through the create-and-delete flow: after submitting the new recipe, it appears in the Redux store and the table shows one row when filtered by the temp name, then deletion removes it from both the database and store, leaving zero rows. When navigating away and back, the recipes reload fresh from the API with the deletion reflected.\n\nNow I'm realizing that `toBeHidden` might not work reliably for elements that no longer exist in the DOM, so I should switch to checking that the filtered row count is zero instead.\n\nFor the persistence check after deletion, I'll navigate away to /calendar and back to /recipes, then search for \"TempDeleteRecipe\" and verify the count stays at zero.\n\nLooking at the edit test again, I need to make sure that after editing and navigating back, the edited recipe with version \"1.1\" appears correctly in the table, and I should also verify that \"Coconut Chips Toasted\" is still visible on page 1 given the 13 recipes in the system.\n\nSince all the HDR tests run before the TBL tests, \"Test Recipe\" will already exist in the database when TBL-7 executes, so the alphabetical ordering should place \"Coconut Chips Toasted\" as the third item on page 1. The search filter will correctly match \"Test Recipe\" when I fill that value, and no other recipe names should contain that substring, so the filtering should work as expected. Everything looks consistent, so I can proceed with writing out the complete test files. I need to make sure the tests directory exists and check for any conflicting test files before proceeding. Since the glob search already confirmed no test files exist for ProductionHub, I can move forward with writing the code. I'll batch the seed-db.ts edits and playwright config together, then write the test file, since they're all independent and can be done in parallel.\n\nActually, I should be careful about running multiple edits on the same file concurrently—they might interfere with each other. Let me chain the four seed-db.ts edits sequentially instead, then run the other writes in parallel.\n\nWait, that's still a lot of operations. Let me think smarter about this. Since I've already read the seed-db.ts file, I can reconstruct the entire updated version in one Write operation instead of doing four separate edits. That's much cleaner and avoids any concurrency issues.\n\nSo my plan is: write the complete updated seed-db.ts file with all the changes (clearing the Almond Butter Smooth instructions, adding the seven new recipes, adding the new materials, and adding the new products), then write playwright.config.ts and the test file in parallel.\n\nLet me construct the full content for seed-db.ts with all the necessary modifications. I'm realizing the Edit tool can handle multiple edits to the same file in parallel since each targets a unique string match, so I can batch all four seed-db.ts changes together without worrying about line shifts affecting the other
