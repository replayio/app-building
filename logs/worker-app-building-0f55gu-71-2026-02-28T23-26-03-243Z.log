Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n7. Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\n8. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.\n9. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions visible in UI.\n10. State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update appropriately.\n11.

Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n7. Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\n8. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.\n9.
