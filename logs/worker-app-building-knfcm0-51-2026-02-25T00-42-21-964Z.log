The package.json already has entries for all scripts (`check`, `schema`, `deploy`, `seed-db`, `test`), but only `check.ts` and `schema.ts` actually exist. I need to implement `deploy.ts`, `seed-db.ts`, and `test.ts`.\n\nSince this is an \"Unpack\" task, I should create sub-tasks for implementing each script and add them to the queue, NOT implement them myself.\n\nWait, let me re-read the task description more carefully: \"Unpack: Implement package scripts for ProductionHub\". \n\nLooking at the AGENTS.md again: \"When a skill needs to 'unpack' into sub-tasks, use add-task to insert them at the front of the queue.\"\n\n\nSo I need to create tasks for the three missing scripts. I notice that `seed-db.ts` is referenced in the test design doc but doesn't have its own design doc yet, which means it should probably be implemented before `test.ts` since the test script depends on it. Looking at the package.json scripts more carefully, I need to figure out which ones require custom implementations versus those that just invoke existing tools directly. The seed-db script is tricky since there's no corresponding design doc, but it's listed as a dependency for the test script, so it probably needs to be implemented as part of that work. unpack, I should create tasks for each missing script. For deploy and test, there are design docs. For seed-db, it doesn't have a specific design doc, but it's needed and referenced in test.md.\n\nLet me create tasks for:\n1. Implement deploy script\n2. Implement seed-db script (may need to be done before test, since test depends on it)\n3. Implement test script\n\nI'll use the writeScript skill for deploy and test (since they have design docs). For seed-db, it doesn't have a design doc in skills/scripts/ so I may need to handle it differently. But the writeScript skill says to read `skills/scripts/<script-name>.md`, and there's no `seed-db.md`.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, maybe seed-db should just be created as part of the test script implementation since the test design doc mentions it. Or perhaps I should check other apps to see if they have seed-db scripts I can reference as a

The deploy.md references \"migration logic from scripts/migrate-db.ts\" but that doesn't exist. The runMigrations function in schema.ts currently does nothing.\n\nLet me look at how the other apps handle this to understand the patterns. Let me read the existing deploy.ts and test.ts from one of the other apps.\n\nActually, for the unpack task, I think I need to create sub-tasks for:\n1. Implement seed-db script (needed by test)\n2. Implement deploy script\n\n\n3. Implement test script\n\nThe seed-db doesn't have a design doc, but the test design doc implies its existence. I should probably look at one of the existing apps to understand how to implement it. Looking at the package.json, deploy.ts has a design doc at skills/scripts/deploy.md, but seed-db doesn't, so I might need to use a different approach for that one rather than the writeScript skill.\n\nFor deploy and test, which have design docs, I'll create writeScript tasks. For seed-db, I should either implement it directly or look at an existing example to understand what it needs to do.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":400,"cache_read_input_tokens":37647,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":400,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1b34dfca-7f55-490e-a8aa-6bc346d05434","uuid":"5a6ec669-54c7-4f76-a3c9-1ac78b047557"}

The task \"Unpack: Implement package scripts for ProductionHub\" means I need to break this down into individual script implementation tasks. Looking at the package.json, the missing scripts are:\n\n1. `deploy.ts` - has design doc at `skills/scripts/deploy.md`\n2. `seed-db.ts` - no design doc, but needed by test and in package.json\n3. `test.ts` - has design doc at `skills/scripts/test.md`\n\nSince this is an \"Unpack\" task, I should:\n1. Add sub-tasks for each missing script using `add-task`\n\n\n2. Signal `<DONE>`\n\nFor seed-db, there's no design doc in `skills/scripts/`, but the test.md design doc references it: \"Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\" This means seed-db needs to be implemented first before test.ts can work. I'll create the tasks in dependency order: seed-db first, then test, then deploy.\n\nThe writeScript skill expects a design doc at `skills/scripts/<script-name>.md`, but there's no seed-db.md. I could either implement seed-db directly as part of this unpack task since it doesn't require a separate design doc, or queue it as a task and let the worker figure out the approach. Since this is an \"Unpack\" task meant to break work into sub-tasks, I should queue the tasks rather than implement them myself.\n\nLooking at the test design doc more carefully, it references seed-db.ts as a separate script that needs to exist first, and package.json lists seed-db as its own entry point. So I need to create seed-db as a standalone task before the test script task, but without a design doc to reference, I'll need to either create one or describe the task clearly enough that the worker can implement it.\n\nI think the simplest approach is to just add three tasks to the queue in dependency order: seed-db first (the worker can reference other apps' patterns and the ProductionHub schema), then deploy, then test. The future worker will have enough context to figure out the details.\n\nBut I need to be careful about the order since the add-task script prepends to the front by default. If I add them sequentially, they'll end up reversed, so I should add test first, then deploy, then seed-db to get the right execution order.","signature":"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
