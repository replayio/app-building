Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

[2026-02-26T03:53:25.723Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01J2uW72YQD5AxSyMW2dfSPE","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup clearly. Let me analyze what's shown:\n\n1. **Navigation bar**: \"Acme Ledger\" with tabs: Dashboard, Transactions, Accounts, Reports. Admin user icon on right.\n2. **Breadcrumb**: \"Home / Transactions\"\n3. **\"New Transaction\" button** - top right, blue/primary button\n4. **Filters section** with \"Clear Filters\" link:\n   - Date Range: calendar icon, \"Oct 1, 2023 - Oct 31, 2023\"\n   - Involved Account(s): multi-select dropdown showing \"Raw Materials Inventory (1200), Accounts Payable (2100) (2 selected)\"\n   - Material: multi-select dropdown showing \"Steel Plates (M001), Plastic Pellets (M002) (2 selected)\"\n   - Transaction Type: dropdown showing \"All Types (Purchase, Consumption, Transfer...)\"\n5. **Search bar**: magnifying glass icon, \"Search by ID or description...\"\n6. **Sort dropdown**: \"Sort by: Date (Newest First)\"\n7. **Result count**: \"Showing 1-10 of 145 results\"\n8. **Table** with sortable columns for Date, Transaction ID, Description, Accounts affected, and Materials with amounts, followed by transaction data rows and pagination controls.\n\nNow I'm checking the test coverage against the mockup components. The NewTransactionButton, DateRangeFilter, AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, and TransactionTypeFilter all have solid test suites covering display, interaction, filtering, and clearing behaviors. The SearchBar tests cover ID and description searches, case-insensitivity, and combined filtering scenarios.\n\nLooking at the TransactionsTable and Pagination tests, they're comprehensive—covering sorting, navigation, row interactions, empty states, and pagination controls. But I'm noticing a discrepancy: the mockup shows a top navigation bar with Dashboard, Transactions, Accounts, and Reports tabs plus an Admin user icon, yet the existing tests only verify that the sidebar shows the Transactions link as active.\n\nChecking against the mockup more carefully, I see the app name \"Acme Ledger\" isn't tested, the navigation links beyond Transactions aren't covered, and the Admin icon in the top right corner is missing from the test suite. The sort indicators on Date and Transaction ID columns are tested, and the mockup correctly shows these columns have sort arrows while Description, Accounts affected, and Materials don't—which the tests do verify.\n\nLooking at what might be gaps: the navigation tabs could be part of a shared component, same with the Admin user icon, but the page title \"Transactions\" itself isn't explicitly tested even though the breadcrumb \"Home / Transactions\" is. The filters are arranged with Date Range, Involved Account(s), Material, and Transaction Type in a row with \"Clear Filters\" positioned to the right of the \"Filters\" label, and I need to verify if this layout is actually covered by the existing tests.\n\nGoing through the directives again, I'm realizing I need to be more thorough about button appearance, exact navigation targets, and interactive states. The sort indicators on the Date and Transaction ID columns could be more explicit in the tests, and I should check whether row hover states are actually being verified since the mockup suggests they're interactive. Looking at the existing test entries more carefully, they're actually quite comprehensive, but I should verify they align with the mockup and spec directives. The main gaps I'm noticing are the page heading \"Transactions\" after the breadcrumb, the \"Filters\" section label itself, and the positioning of the \"Clear Filters\" link to the right of that label. I should also check if there are enough tests for multiple filter combinations beyond just the search + account filter case, and whether the table rows properly indicate they're clickable with visual feedback.\n\nScanning through the spec requirements, the core functionality seems covered—filtering by date range, account, material, and transaction type; sorting by date or ID; searching by ID or description; creating new transactions; and clicking rows for details. The remaining question is whether additional tests would meaningfully validate the UI beyond what's already there.\n\nThe key gaps I'm seeing are tests for the page heading itself, the \"Filters\" section label, combinations of multiple filters working together, and ensuring pagination resets when filters change. I should also verify that every interactive element has corresponding test coverage as the directive requires. Looking at the directive about state-changing actions and data mutations, I realize the TransactionsPage is essentially read-only except for navigation, so most of those requirements don't apply here. I should add a few more test cases though—like verifying the page heading displays correctly, checking that pagination resets when filters change, and testing some combined filter scenarios to ensure they work together properly. I'm realizing the task might be asking me to write new test entries rather than review existing ones. Let me look at how other PlanPage tasks were structured to understand what's actually expected here—it seems like there should be a pattern for how component test entries get added across different pages. the entries already exist, so I need to review them against the testSpec.md directives and fill in any gaps. Looking through each component, most have solid coverage, but I notice the TransactionsTable is missing tests for the page heading and the filters section itself—I should add those to ensure complete compliance with the spec. Filters\" label** should be tested\n- Test for pagination resetting to page 1 when filters/sort change\n- Test for combined filters (date + account + material + type all at once)\n\n**Missing from Pagination:**\n- Test that applying a new filter resets pagination to page 1 (partially covered by \"Pagination updates when filters reduce the number of results\" but could be more explicit)\n\nLooking at the mockup more carefully, I notice a few gaps: the page heading \"Transactions\" isn't tested separately from the breadcrumb, the \"Filters\" label visibility should be verified, and there's a potential inconsistency between the sidebar shown in tests versus the top navigation in the mockup. But the directive prioritizes consistent navigation patterns over exact image adherence, so I should focus on testing the active state without being prescriptive about sidebar versus top nav. I'll add three targeted tests: one for the page heading, one for the \"Filters\" label, and one explicitly confirming pagination resets when filters change. I'm identifying the specific test cases that are still missing from the suite—a test for the page heading display, one that verifies filters reset pagination to page 1, and another checking that sort order persists when navigating between pages. Let me add these to fill out the coverage. I've verified the test entries against the directives and they're quite comprehensive—all interactive elements are covered with proper titles, grouping, component references, and action verification. The main gap I notice is that the mockup includes a \"Reports\" navigation link that isn't mentioned in the spec's listed pages, so I should clarify whether that needs testing or if it's extraneous to the current scope.\n\nTo round out the test suite, I'll add entries for the page heading, the Filters section label, a multi-filter combination test, a test ensuring pagination resets when filters change, and one verifying that sort selections carry over during page

So there are 61 tests for TransactionsPage (63 minus 2 from the next page). Let me verify.\n\nActually wait, it said 63 in the count but I see 63 lines in the output. Let me check - the last two (\"Transaction header displays Transaction ID...\" and \"Transaction header displays status badge...\") are from TransactionDetailPage. So 61 tests for TransactionsPage.\n\nActually, looking at the `sed -n '1821,2260p'` - line 2260 might be including the start of TransactionDetailPage. \n\nI'm not going to worry about the exact line numbers shifting - what matters is that all the tests are accounted for. Let me break down the component structure to verify everything's there: NewTransactionButton has 4 tests covering the page heading, filters section, new transaction button display, and navigation behavior.\n\nDateRangeFilter, AccountFilter, and MaterialFilter each have their own test suites covering display, interaction, filtering functionality, and state management. The MaterialFilter tests continue with deselection behavior and filter reset functionality.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the remaining test suites for TransactionTypeFilter, which handles type-based filtering and a master clear filters action, SearchBar with its text-based search capabilities across transaction IDs and descriptions, case-insensitive matching, and combined filtering scenarios, and TransactionsTable which appears to be starting its own test coverage. 16 tests):\n1. Breadcrumb displays Home / Transactions\n2. Sidebar shows Transactions link as active\n3. Sort dropdown displays with \"Sort by: Date (Newest First)\" as default\n4. Opening the sort dropdown shows available sort options\n5. Selecting \"Date (Oldest First)\" sorts the table by date ascending\n6. Result count displays total number of matching results\n7. Transactions table displays correct column headers\n8. Transactions table shows transaction rows with correct data\n9. Accounts affected column displays double-entry Dr/Cr notation with account numbers\n10. Materials and amounts column displays material codes, quantities, units, and pricing\n11. Materials and amounts column displays multiple materials separated by semicolons\n12. Materials and amounts column shows N/A with amount for non-material transactions\n13. Clicking the Date column header sorts transactions by date\n14. Clicking the Transaction ID column header sorts by ID, and clicking a transaction row opens the detail page\n15. The table shows an empty state when no results match the applied filters\n\nNow I'm looking at the pagination tests—there are 14 of them covering the navigation controls, rows per page selection,
