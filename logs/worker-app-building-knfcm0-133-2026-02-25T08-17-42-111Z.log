You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bc700892-7a52-4da8-bd27-1cc291247e37","uuid":"9e38146c-ee4b-4b73-b872-e74aa00c1ee3","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

[2026-02-25T08:15:15.211Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_0173JLkXyccb2x9tsWov9gPm","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup clearly. Let me analyze what's in it:\n\n**Header Area:**\n- Breadcrumb: \"/deals\"\n- Page title: \"Deals List\"\n- \"Create New Deal\" button (top right, blue)\n\n**Summary Cards (4 cards):**\n1. Total Active Deals: 124 (with clipboard/document icon)\n2. Pipeline Value: $4.5M (with document/briefcase icon)\n3. Won (Q3): 32 ($1.2M) (with trophy/award icon)\n4. Lost (Q3): 18 ($0.6M) (with X/loss icon)\n\n\nBelow the summary cards, there's a toggle between Table View and Pipeline View, with Table View currently selected. The interface includes a filter section with dropdowns for stage, client, and status, plus a date range picker and sort options, along with a search bar. The main table displays deal information across columns like deal name, client, stage, owner, value, close date, and status with color-coded badges indicating whether deals are on track, need attention, or are at risk. I'm seeing the rest of the sample data and pagination setup. Now I need to organize the component structure—the scaffold already has all the pieces listed, so I'll add section headers for each component under DealsListPage and then fill in test entries across the subtasks, starting with the summary cards and view toggle in subtask 2, followed by the filters in subtask 3.\n\nLooking at subtask 4, I notice it covers the table, pipeline view, and modals, but DealsListHeader and DealsPagination aren't explicitly assigned yet—I should figure out where those fit best in the existing subtask breakdown. subtask 1 since it's straightforward, and fold DealsPagination into subtask 4 with the table components.\n\nFor the first subtask, I need to set up section headers in the docs and write out the test entries for DealsListHeader. Looking at the mockup, the header includes a page title with breadcrumb navigation and buttons for creating deals, importing, and exporting. I'll follow the same pattern I see in ClientsListPage to ensure consistency across the app. I need to include an Import button alongside the Create New Deal button to match the existing component scaffold and AppRevisions structure, even though the mockup only shows Create New Deal. Now I'm structuring the test entries by setting up section headers for all components, writing the DealsListHeader tests first, and saving DealsPagination for the table section. Let me start replacing the DealsListPage placeholder with proper component sections and draft the DealsListHeader based on what's visible in the mockup. deals\"\n- Page title \"Deals List\" \n- \"Create New Deal\" button (blue, top right)\n\nWait - I see the sidebar in the mockup shows \"DealsListPage\" at top, then Dashboard, Clients, Deals (highlighted), Reports, Settings. But from AppRevisions, sidebar should have Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, Settings. Dashboard and Reports were removed. So I should follow the AppRevisions for sidebar consistency. But for the deals page test spec, I'm focused on the page content not the sidebar.\n\nLet me write the tests now.\n\nFor the mockup, the summary cards show:\n- Total Active Deals: 124\n- Pipeline Value: $4.5M\n- Won (Q3): 32 ($1.2M)\n- Lost (Q3): 18 ($0.6M)\n\nThe filter bar has Stage and Client dropdowns that are searchable, along with Status and Date Range filters, plus a Sort by Close Date dropdown with directional arrows and a search field. The table displays Deal Name, Client, Stage, Owner, Value, Close Date with sort indicators, Status badges, and an Actions menu, with pagination showing page 1 of 9. The pipeline view also supports drag and drop functionality for updating deals.\n\nNow I'm looking at the CSV import format which includes Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, and Status fields. I should plan out the full test specification covering all these

An actions column (no header text) is present as the last column.\n\n**Deal Name column displays deal names**\nGiven the user is on /deals with deal data, each row shows the deal's name in the Deal Name column (e.g., \"Project Alpha Expansion\", \"Q4 Marketing Campaign\").\n\n**Client column displays associated client name**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the associated client's name in the Client column (e.g., \"Acme Corp.\", \"Beta Industries\").\n\n**Stage column displays current deal stage**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal's current stage in the Stage column (e.g., \"Proposal Sent\", \"Qualification\", \"Negotiation\", \"Discovery\", \"Closed Won\").\n\n**Owner column displays deal owner name**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal owner's name in the Owner column (e.g., \"Sarah K.\", \"Mike R.\", \"Emily L.\", \"Chris B.\").\n\n**Value column displays monetary value**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal's monetary value formatted as currency in the Value column (e.g., \"$250,000\", \"$75,000\", \"$450,000\").\n\n**Close Date column displays date with sort arrow**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal's expected close date in the Close Date column (e.g., \"2023-11-15\", \"2023-12-01\"). The column header displays a directional arrow icon reflecting the current sort direction.\n\n**Clicking Close Date header toggles sort direction**\nGiven the user is on /deals with Close Date sorted descending (newest first, ArrowDown icon), when they click the Close Date column header, the sort direction toggles to ascending (oldest first, ArrowUp icon) and the table rows reorder accordingly. Clicking again toggles back to descending.\n\n**Close Date header has data-sort-direction attribute**\nGiven the user is on /deals, the Close Date column header's sort button exposes a `data-sort-direction` attribute with value \"desc\" when sorted descending, \"asc\" when sorted ascending, and \"none\" when not sorted by close date.\n\n**Status column displays color-coded badges**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row shows the deal's status as a color-coded badge in the Status column: \"On Track\" in green, \"Needs Attention\" in yellow/amber, \"At Risk\" in red, \"Won\" in green (distinct from On Track).\n\n**Actions menu button visible on each row**\nGiven the user is on /deals, each row has a three-dot actions menu button (\"...\") in the last column.\n\n**Actions menu opens on click**\nGiven the user is on /deals, when they click the three-dot actions menu on a deal row, a dropdown menu appears with action options (e.g., Edit, Delete, View Details).\n\n**Actions menu Edit option opens edit deal modal**\nGiven the user is on /deals and clicks the actions menu on a deal row, when they select \"Edit\", an edit modal opens pre-populated with the deal's current data allowing the user to modify deal fields.\n\n**Actions menu Delete option removes deal after confirmation**\nGiven the user is on /deals and clicks the actions menu on a deal row, when they select \"Delete\", a confirmation dialog appears. When the user confirms, the deal is deleted from the database and the row is removed from the table. If the user cancels, the deal remains.\n\n**Row click navigates to DealDetailPage**\nGiven the user is on /deals, when they click on a deal row (anywhere except the actions menu), the app navigates to /deals/:dealId for that deal and the DealDetailPage is displayed.\n\n**Table displays empty state when no deals match filters**\nGiven the user is on /deals and applies filters that match no deals, the table displays an empty state message indicating no deals were found.\n\n**New deal appears in table after creation**\nGiven the user is on /deals and creates a new deal via the CreateDealModal, when the modal closes, the newly created deal appears in the table without requiring a page refresh.\n\n**Deleted deal is removed from table**\nGiven the user is on /deals and deletes a deal via the actions menu, when the deletion is confirmed, the deal row is removed from the table without requiring a page refresh.\n\n#### PipelineView\n\n**Pipeline displays columns for each deal stage**\nGiven the user is on /deals with Pipeline View active, the pipeline view displays kanban-style columns for each deal stage (e.g., Discovery, Qualification, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost). Each column has a header showing the stage name.\n\n**Deal cards are displayed in their respective stage columns**\nGiven deals exist at various stages, each deal card is displayed in the column corresponding to its current stage. A deal at \"Proposal Sent\" appears in the Proposal Sent column.\n\n**Deal cards display deal name**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card shows the deal's name (e.g., \"Project Alpha Expansion\").\n\n**Deal cards display client name**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card shows the associated client's name (e.g., \"Acme Corp.\").\n\n**Deal cards display value**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card shows the deal's monetary value (e.g., \"$250,000\").\n\n**Deal cards display owner**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card shows the deal owner's name.\n\n**Deal cards are draggable**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, the card is draggable — the user can click and hold the card to initiate a drag operation. The card visually indicates it is being dragged.\n\n**Dropping a deal card on a different stage column updates the deal stage**\nGiven the user drags a deal card from the \"Discovery\" column and drops it on the \"Qualification\" column, the deal's stage is updated to \"Qualification\" via the API, the card moves to the Qualification column, and the change is persisted to the database.\n\n**Drag-and-drop stage change creates a timeline entry on the deal's client**\nGiven the user drops a deal card to a new stage column, a \"Deal Stage Changed\" timeline entry is created on the associated client recording the old stage and new stage, attributed to the current user (or \"System\" if unauthenticated). Exactly one timeline entry is created.\n\n**Drag-and-drop stage change triggers follower notifications**\nGiven the user drops a deal card to a new stage on a deal whose associated client has followers, email notifications are sent to followers who have \"deal stage changed\" notifications enabled (excluding the actor).\n\n**Deal card click navigates to DealDetailPage**\nGiven a deal card is displayed in the pipeline view, when the user clicks on the card (not during a drag), the app navigates to /deals/:dealId for that deal and the DealDetailPage is displayed.\n\n**Pipeline columns show deal count**\nGiven the pipeline view is active, each stage column header displays the count of deals in that column (e.g., \"Discovery (3)\").\n\n**Empty columns display empty state**\nGiven no deals exist at a particular stage, that stage column in the pipeline view displays an empty state (e.g., empty area or \"No deals\" message) but the column remains visible as a drop target.\n\n#### DealsPagination\n\n**Pagination shows current page and total pages**\nGiven the user is on /deals with Table View active and more deals than fit on one page, the pagination area displays text like \"Page 1 of 9\" indicating the current page and total pages.\n\n**Clicking next page navigates to the next page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 1 with multiple pages, when they click the next page control, the table updates to show page 2 data and the pagination text updates to \"Page 2 of 9\".\n\n**Clicking previous page navigates to the prior page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 2, when they click the previous page control, the table updates to show page 1 data.\n\n**Previous control is disabled on first page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing page 1, the previous page control is disabled or visually inactive, indicating there is no previous page.\n\n**Next control is disabled on last page**\nGiven the user is on /deals viewing the last page, the next page control is disabled or visually inactive, indicating there is no next page.\n\n**Pagination updates when filters reduce results**\nGiven the user is on /deals with pagination showing multiple pages, when they apply a filter that reduces the results to fit within one page, the pagination updates accordingly.\n\n#### CreateDealModal\n\n**Modal opens when Create New Deal is clicked**\nGiven the user is on /deals, when they click \"Create New Deal\", a modal dialog appears with a form title (e.g., \"Create New Deal\").\n\n**Modal contains deal name input field (required)**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Deal Name\" or \"Name\" text input field that is required.\n\n**Modal contains client dropdown populated from clients**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Client\" FilterSelect dropdown populated with existing clients from the API, with searchable functionality. It is not a free-form text field.\n\n**Modal contains value input field**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Value\" numeric input field for the deal's monetary value.\n\n**Modal contains stage selector**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Stage\" selector with deal pipeline stage options (e.g., Discovery, Qualification, Proposal Sent, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost).\n\n**Modal contains owner dropdown populated from users API**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains an \"Owner\" FilterSelect dropdown populated with team members from the users API, instead of a free-form text field.\n\n**Modal contains probability field**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Probability\" field for the deal's win probability (e.g., percentage input).\n\n**Modal contains expected close date picker**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains an \"Expected Close Date\" date picker field.\n\n**Modal contains status selector**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open, the form contains a \"Status\" selector with options such as On Track, Needs Attention, At Risk.\n\n**Submit creates a new deal**\nGiven the CreateDealModal is open and the user fills in deal name \"New Service Package\", selects client \"Acme Corp.\", enters value \"$50,000\", stage \"Qualification\", selects an owner, and clicks submit, the deal is created in the database, the modal closes, and the new deal appears in the deals table.\n\n**Deal creation generates a timeline entry on the client**\nGiven the user creates a new deal via CreateDealModal associated with a client, a \"Deal Created\" timeline entry is added to the client's TimelineSection attributed to the current user (or \"System\" if unauthenticated). Exactly one timeline entry is created.","numLines":300,"startLine":876,"totalLines":1285}}}
