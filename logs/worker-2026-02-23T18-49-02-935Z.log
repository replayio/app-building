Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    83→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n    84→- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n    85→\n    86→## Tech Stack\n    87→\n    88→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    89→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    90→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    91→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    92→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    93→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    94→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions.

It launches a headed browser\n    78→  which will crash in this headless container (`Missing X server or $DISPLAY`). Always use the\n    79→  Playwright deployment test config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) which runs headless with\n    80→  `@replayio/playwright` and handles browser setup correctly.\n    81→- Do NOT install or start Xvfb. All browsers must run headless. If a browser complains about\n    82→  a missing display, the fix is to ensure it runs headless, not to add a virtual display.\n    83→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n    84→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for verifying the deployment. If the\n    85→  upload is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT decide you have \"enough information\"\n    86→  and proceed without the recording — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis cycle.\n    87→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01AGKFNkxXcJ6DnyUXSq7Adn","session_id":"43e5740d-520f-43b8-8281-b08f938db847","uuid":"0ed278ba-5956-4612-a99f-a572baa79f5a"}

Deployment Script** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/deploy.ts`):\n- Lines 23-42: `readEnvFile()` and `writeEnvValue()` functions manage `.env`\n- Lines 97-132: `ensureNetlifySite()` checks for `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` in `.env`\n- Creates new site via Netlify API if ID not found\n- Line 171: Writes URL to `deployment.txt` after each deployment\n\n**2. Environment Requirements** (lines 134-137):\nRequired environment variables:\n- `NEON_API_KEY` - For Neon database\n- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - For Netlify authentication\n- `NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG` - For Netlify site creation\n\n**3.

Root Configuration** (`/repo/fly.toml`):\n- Minimal config - just specifies Dockerfile path\n- Primary deployment infrastructure is Netlify, not Fly.io\n\n**7. Vite Config** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/vite.config.ts`):\n- Production builds: `sourcemap: true, minify: false` (for debugging)\n- NODE_ENV hardcoded to `\"development\"` even in production builds\n\n### Deployment Flow\n\n1. **Deploy script triggers** (`npm run deploy`)\n2. **Database setup**: Creates/uses existing Neon project\n3. **Schema sync**: Initializes database schema\n4. **Site creation**: Checks `.env` for `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`\n   - If missing → creates NEW Netlify site with `Date.now()` in name\n   - If found → reuses existing site\n5. **Build**: `vite build` → creates `/dist` directory\n6. **Deploy**: `netlify deploy --prod --dir dist --functions ./netlify/functions`\n7. **Record**: Writes URL and metadata to `deployment.txt`\n\n### Testing Configuration\n\n- **Deployment test**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/playwright.deployment.config.ts`\n- Uses Replay browser for recording: `@replayio/playwright`\n- Test file: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deployment.spec.ts`\n- Excluded from regular test runs via `playwright.config.ts`\n\n### Related Strategies\n\n- `/repo/strategies/messages/findLastDeployment.md` - Strategy for reading deployment info\n- `/repo/strategies/jobs/deployment.md` - Complete deployment job strategy\n- `/repo/strategies/scripts/deploy.md` - Script specification and requirements\n\n### Summary\n\n**Why URLs keep changing:**\n1. `.env` file (containing `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`) is not persisted between deployments\n2. Script creates new Netlify site on each run when `.env` is missing\n3. Each new site gets a unique URL with a timestamp\n\n**Solution approaches:**\n- Persist `.env` between deployments in your CI/CD system or deployment environment\n- Or manually set `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` in the deployment environment each time\n- Or update the script to accept `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` as an environment variable that takes precedence"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: aed619fd8d1d4881c (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 37107\ntool_uses: 39\nduration_ms: 49813</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"43e5740d-520f-43b8-8281-b08f938db847","uuid":"51b16b04-0503-4e2c-86ba-47633a9cc04c","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand how deployment settings are managed in this sales CRM project.

Deployment Info** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/deployment.txt`):\nCurrent state (Feb 23, 2026):\n```\nurl=https://sales-crm-1771869000486.netlify.app\nsite_id=3f44f0c3-61b5-4ecf-9f7b-877c304f57a7\ndeployed_at=2026-02-23T17:51:41.307Z\n```\n\n**6. Root Configuration** (`/repo/fly.toml`):\n- Minimal config - just specifies Dockerfile path\n- Primary deployment infrastructure is Netlify, not Fly.io\n\n**7. Vite Config** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/vite.config.ts`):\n- Production builds: `sourcemap: true, minify: false` (for debugging)\n- NODE_ENV hardcoded to `\"development\"` even in production builds\n\n### Deployment Flow\n\n1. **Deploy script triggers** (`npm run deploy`)\n2. **Database setup**: Creates/uses existing Neon project\n3. **Schema sync**: Initializes database schema\n4. **Site creation**: Checks `.env` for `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`\n   - If missing → creates NEW Netlify site with `Date.now()` in name\n   - If found → reuses existing site\n5. **Build**: `vite build` → creates `/dist` directory\n6. **Deploy**: `netlify deploy --prod --dir dist --functions ./netlify/functions`\n7. **Record**: Writes URL and metadata to `deployment.txt`\n\n### Testing Configuration\n\n- **Deployment test**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/playwright.deployment.config.ts`\n- Uses Replay browser for recording: `@replayio/playwright`\n- Test file: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/deployment.spec.ts`\n- Excluded from regular test runs via `playwright.config.ts`\n\n### Related Strategies\n\n- `/repo/strategies/messages/findLastDeployment.md` - Strategy for reading deployment info\n- `/repo/strategies/jobs/deployment.md` - Complete deployment job strategy\n- `/repo/strategies/scripts/deploy.md` - Script specification and requirements\n\n### Summary\n\n**Why URLs keep changing:**\n1. `.env` file (containing `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`) is not persisted between deployments\n2. Script creates new Netlify site on each run when `.env` is missing\n3. Each new site gets a unique URL with a timestamp\n\n**Solution approaches:**\n- Persist `.env` between deployments in your CI/CD system or deployment environment\n- Or manually set `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` in the deployment environment each time\n- Or update the script to accept `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` as an environment variable that takes precedence"}],"totalDurationMs":49813,"totalTokens":37107,"totalToolUseCount":39,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":341,"cache_read_input_tokens":35221,"output_tokens":1541,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":341},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}
