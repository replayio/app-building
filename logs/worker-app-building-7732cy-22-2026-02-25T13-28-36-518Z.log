I need to queue build tasks for each one. Per the `buildInitialApp.md` skill, each app needs 7 stages queued with `--trailing` to append them in order.\n[TodoWrite]\nNow let me check the skill files to see if they expect app-specific subtask descriptions.\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\nGood. The skill files handle the unpacking themselves. Now I need to understand if the subtask descriptions need to reference the specific app. Let me check the `add-task.ts` script to see if there's an `--app` flag or similar.\n[read] /repo/scripts/add-task.ts\nI see there's no `--app` flag. Let me check how the worker knows which app to work on. Let me look at the worker script.\n$ ls /repo/scripts/\nadd-task.ts\n$ ls /repo/skills/tasks/build/\ntestSpec.md\ntesting.md\nwriteApp.md\nwriteShared.md\nwriteTests.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\nI see the skills reference `AppSpec.md` relatively — this suggests the worker runs with a working directory set to the app's directory. Let me check the `buildInitialApp.md` skill more carefully to see if there's a way to specify which app.\n\nLooking at the buildInitialApp.md skill again, the template commands don't include any app-specific parameter. The subtask descriptions themselves should identify the app. Let me check if there's a convention for this by looking at any existing patterns.\n[grep] APP_DIR|appDir|app.dir|--app|appName|APP_NAME\n[grep] app.*subtask|subtask.*app|Unpack.*Write|Unpack.*Build\nThe subtask descriptions don't include the app name. Let me check how the worker determines which app to work on. Let me look for worker-related files.\n[glob] **/worker*\n[read] /repo/src/worker.ts\n[grep] APP_DIR|APP_NAME|CURRENT_APP|currentApp|appName\n[grep] CLAUDE\\.md|claude\\.md|CLAUDE_MD\n[grep] extraArgs|--allowedTools|AGENTS\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/deployment.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/writeScript.md\nNow I understand the structure. The skills reference things like `AppSpec.md` relative to the app directory. The subtask descriptions should include the app name so the agent knows which app's directory to work in. Let me look at how the subtask format encodes the app name.\n\nLooking at the `buildInitialApp.md` skill, the template subtasks don't explicitly include the app name, but the skill itself references `AppSpec.md` - the agent will need to figure out which app from context. Since we're queuing tasks for multiple apps, the subtask descriptions should include the ap... (truncated)\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern where the subtask names encode the app:\n[grep] SalesCRM|Accounting|InventoryTracker|ProductionHub|SupplierTracker\n[grep] Unpack.*app|app.*Unpack\nNow I understand the system. I need to queue 7 build stages per app using `--trailing` to append them in order.

Per the `buildInitialApp.md` skill, each app needs 7 stages queued with `--trailing` to append them in order.\n[TodoWrite]\nNow let me check the skill files to see if they expect app-specific subtask descriptions.\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\nGood. The skill files handle the unpacking themselves. Now I need to understand if the subtask descriptions need to reference the specific app. Let me check the `add-task.ts` script to see if there's an `--app` flag or similar.\n[read] /repo/scripts/add-task.ts\nI see there's no `--app` flag. Let me check how the worker knows which app to work on. Let me look at the worker script.\n$ ls /repo/scripts/\nadd-task.ts\n$ ls /repo/skills/tasks/build/\ntestSpec.md\ntesting.md\nwriteApp.md\nwriteShared.md\nwriteTests.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\nI see the skills reference `AppSpec.md` relatively — this suggests the worker runs with a working directory set to the app's directory. Let me check the `buildInitialApp.md` skill more carefully to see if there's a way to specify which app.\n\nLooking at the buildInitialApp.md skill again, the template commands don't include any app-specific parameter. The subtask descriptions themselves should identify the app. Let me check if there's a convention for this by looking at any existing patterns.\n[grep] APP_DIR|appDir|app.dir|--app|appName|APP_NAME\n[grep] app.*subtask|subtask.*app|Unpack.*Write|Unpack.*Build\nThe subtask descriptions don't include the app name. Let me check how the worker determines which app to work on. Let me look for worker-related files.\n[glob] **/worker*\n[read] /repo/src/worker.ts\n[grep] APP_DIR|APP_NAME|CURRENT_APP|currentApp|appName\n[grep] CLAUDE\\.md|claude\\.md|CLAUDE_MD\n[grep] extraArgs|--allowedTools|AGENTS\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/deployment.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/writeScript.md\nNow I understand the structure. The skills reference things like `AppSpec.md` relative to the app directory. The subtask descriptions should include the app name so the agent knows which app's directory to work in. Let me look at how the subtask format encodes the app name.\n\nLooking at the `buildInitialApp.md` skill, the template subtasks don't explicitly include the app name, but the skill itself references `AppSpec.md` - the agent will need to figure out which app from context. Since we're queuing tasks for multiple apps, the subtask descriptions should include the ap... (truncated)\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern where the subtask names encode the app:\n[grep] SalesCRM|Accounting|InventoryTracker|ProductionHub|SupplierTracker\n[grep] Unpack.*app|app.*Unpack\nNow I understand the system. I need to queue 7 build stages per app using `--trailing` to append them in order. I'll include the app name in each subtask so the agent knows which app to work on.\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --subtask \"Unpack: Write test specification for Accounting\" --trailing && npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md\" --subtask \"Unpack: Write app shared code for Accounting\" --trailing && ...
