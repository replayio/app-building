Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}
