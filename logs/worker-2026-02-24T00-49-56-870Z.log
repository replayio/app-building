The test must create a new account,\n   102→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   103→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   104→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   105→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   106→\n   107→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   108→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   109→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   110→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   111→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   112→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   113→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   126→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   127→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   128→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   129→  being unmodified.\n   130→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests.

Since this is all for ContactsListPage, I'll add one group with all the test entries.\n\nLet me construct the add-group command with all the test entries.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":780,"cache_read_input_tokens":27678,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":780,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7f74c5b9-bbe0-4735-a30b-fc958510290d","uuid":"c8f71f85-53c2-4419-bd8c-225565ee0476"}
