Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root.

Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\n     4→web apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n     5→\n     6→Key directories:\n     7→\n     8→* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n     9→* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n    10→* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n    24→3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    25→   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    26→\n    27→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    28→matching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    29→\n    30→## Worker Execution\n    31→\n    32→The worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    39→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    40→\n    41→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    42→\n    43→## Task System\n    44→\n    45→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    67→\n    68→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n    69→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    98→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    99→\n   100→## Database\n   101→\n   102→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   103→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   104→frontend components.\n   105→\n   106→## Quality Gates\n   107→\n   108→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   109→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   110→\n   111→## Commits\n   112→\n   113→The worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\n   114→explicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n   115→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01PyTgTFghsWrk9SbfkNjJRu","session_id":"bad320f7-4e89-4421-a971-627ae1337f0d","uuid":"ae8e0e5c-4c2c-47b6-bac9-b3e97fd4d64b"}

May also show probability and expected close date.\n    64→\n    65→Writeups section: free-form or structured notes describing the deal context, needs, strategy, and updates. Supports multiple entries, editing, and possibly versioning.\n    66→\n    67→Linked Tasks section: shows tasks specifically associated with this deal (which are also tied to the client). Allows adding/editing tasks and marking them complete.\n    68→\n    69→Attachments section: lists attachments specifically linked to this deal (also visible in the client’s attachments section) with upload/download/delete actions.\n    70→\n    71→Contacts/Individuals section: lists key individuals involved in the deal (decision makers, influencers), with links to their Individual Detail pages.\n    72→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd0kqIkMnxTNlqb6OFiuMyICRwo9VUXgPnsJfA\n    73→\n    74→6.

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01PyTgTFghsWrk9SbfkNjJRu","session_id":"bad320f7-4e89-4421-a971-627ae1337f0d","uuid":"1810d437-5e8f-4b52-b036-873cd231bd6d"}

Implemented:**\n1. **ClientsListPage** (`/clients`) — Tabular/card-based listing with search, filtering (status, tags, source), sorting, pagination\n2. **ClientDetailPage** (`/clients/:clientId`) — Multi-section layout: header, source info, tasks, deals, attachments, people, timeline\n3. **PersonDetailPage** (`/individuals/:individualId`) — Individual contact detail with relationships and contact history\n4. **DealsListPage** (`/deals`) — Table or pipeline/board view with filtering by stage, client, status\n5. **DealDetailPage** (`/deals/:dealId`) — Header with deal metrics, stage/history, writeups, linked tasks, attachments, contacts\n6. **TasksListPage** (`/tasks`) — List of upcoming tasks with assignees\n7. **TaskDetailPage** (`/tasks/:taskId`) — Task detail with notes section\n8. **ContactsListPage** (`/contacts`) — Searchable table of individuals with CSV import/export\n9. **UsersListPage** (`/users`) — Team member grid with stats\n10. **UserDetailPage**

by stage\n- Optional authentication with email/password signup and confirmation\n- Email notifications for followed clients\n- CSV import/export for clients, deals, tasks, contacts\n- Searchable FilterSelect dropdowns\n- Webhook configuration for external services\n- Client following system\n- User-based deal ownership and task assignment\n\n---\n\n### Test Specification\n\n**Source File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (40,000+ lines)\n\n**Key Test Sections:**\n- **Sidebar Navigation** — 6 nav links (Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, Settings) with active state highlighting\n- **SidebarAuth** — Sign in/up forms, forgot password, sign out, auth state persistence\n- **ClientsListPage** — Search, filters (status, tags, source, sort), table columns, pagination\n- **ClientsTable** — Row navigation, actions menu, empty states, real-time updates\n- **AddClientModal** — Form validation, type/status/tags selectors\n- **Pagination** — Range display, page navigation, button states\n- Plus comprehensive tests for all other pages and components\n\n---\n\n### Design System\n\n**Source Files:**\n- `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md` — Global design reference\n- `/repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css` — CSS custom properties\n- `/repo/apps/shared/styles/layout.css` — Layout components\n- `/repo/apps/shared/styles/common.css` — Common styles\n\n**Key Design Tokens:**\n- **Sidebar Width:** 240px\n- **Colors:** Forest green palette (`#4d7c5e` primary) with warm gray accents\n- **Typography:** Inter Variable font family; 16px body base\n- **Button

components\n\n**State Management Pattern:**\n- Page components dispatch async thunks from Redux slices\n- Child components receive data via props and dispatch actions via hooks\n- Modals manage local state for form inputs; submit triggers async thunk\n\n**Authentication:**\n- Optional auth middleware on Netlify Functions\n- Auth state stored in Redux\n- Sidebar shows \"Sign In\" button when not authenticated\n- Inline auth form in sidebar toggles between sign in/up modes\n\n---\n\nThis is a fully-featured SPA with comprehensive CRM functionality, built with modern React patterns, Redux for state management, and Netlify serverless backend services with Postgres database."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a0f4ef4db85d5cc50 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if

highlighting\n- **SidebarAuth** — Sign in/up forms, forgot password, sign out, auth state persistence\n- **ClientsListPage** — Search, filters (status, tags, source, sort), table columns, pagination\n- **ClientsTable** — Row navigation, actions menu, empty states, real-time updates\n- **AddClientModal** — Form validation, type/status/tags selectors\n- **Pagination** — Range display, page navigation, button states\n- Plus comprehensive tests for all other pages and components\n\n---\n\n### Design System\n\n**Source Files:**\n- `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md` — Global design reference\n- `/repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css` — CSS custom properties\n- `/repo/apps/shared/styles/layout.css` — Layout components\n- `/repo/apps/shared/styles/common.css` — Common styles\n\n**Key Design Tokens:**\n- **Sidebar Width:** 240px\n- **Colors:** Forest green palette (`#4d7c5e` primary) with warm gray accents\n- **Typography:** Inter Variable font family; 16px body base\n- **Button

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bad320f7-4e89-4421-a971-627ae1337f0d","uuid":"868a93c0-bd30-4581-86c5-8d0ddce0e375","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bad320f7-4e89-4421-a971-627ae1337f0d","uuid":"ea42974d-464c-44f6-a556-a0ae7165ea8e","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-size: 14px;\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex / Value         |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —                   |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.05)` | ~5% warm black     |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(234, 231, 226)`     | `#eae7e2`          |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(242, 240, 236)`     | `#f2f0ec`          |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(230, 237, 232)`     | `#e6ede8`          |\n\nSelected row uses a very faint green tint to reinforce the accent color without being loud.\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: 4px;\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px 8px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(55, 52, 46);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background           | Description                  |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| Default | transparent          | No background                |\n| Hover   | rgb(235, 233, 228)   | `#ebe9e4` — warm subtle gray |\n| Active  | rgb(226, 224, 218)   | `#e2e0da` — slightly deeper  |\n\n### Active Nav Item (current page)\n\n```css\nbackground: rgb(226, 234, 229);  /* very faint green tint */\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#ddd9d3` — a warm gray rather than cool.\nHover border darkens to approximately `#c5c0b8`.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value | Usage                     |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| 4px   | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px   | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px   | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%   | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                    |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.15) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows use a warm-tinted black rather than pure black, keeping the overall palette cohesive.\n\n---\n\n## Transitions\n\n| Property         | Duration | Easing   | Usage                    |\n|------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|\n| background-color | 0.1s     | ease     | Fast hover interactions  |\n| opacity          | 0.2s     | ease-out | Standard fade-in/out     |\n| color            | 0.15s    | ease     | Text color shifts        |\n| fill             | 0.4s     | ease     | Icon color transitions   |\n\n---\n\n## CSS Custom Properties\n\n### Backgrounds & Colors\n`--bg-color`, `--bg-sidebar-color`, `--bg-base-color`, `--bg-border-color`, `--content-color-light`, `--content-highlight-color-light`\n\n### Interactive States\n`--normal-bg`, `--normal-border`, `--normal-border-hover`, `--normal-text`\n\n### Accent\n`--accent-primary: #4d7c5e`, `--accent-light: #5a8f6a`, `--accent-dark: #3e694e`, `--accent-muted: #6b8f7a`, `--accent-subtle-bg: #e6ede8`\n\n### Sizing\n`--sidebar-width` (240px), `--scrollbar-width` (12px), `--control-border-radius` (4px)\n\n---\n\n## Status Colors\n\nFor data-driven UIs that need status indicators (e.g., pipeline stages, priority levels):\n\n| Status     | Color     | Hex       | Notes                     |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Success    | Forest    | `#4d7c5e` | Matches primary accent    |\n| Warning    | Amber     | `#b08a3e` | Warm gold, not bright yellow |\n| Error      | Brick     | `#b05050` | Muted red, not alarming   |\n| Info       | Slate     | `#5a7a8a` | Cool blue-gray            |\n| Neutral    | Stone     | `#8a8580` | Warm gray                 |\n\nAll status colors are desaturated to fit the subdued palette. Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

Let me plan the implementation:\n\n1. **Backend**: The current tasks endpoint only supports `GET` by `clientId` or `dealId`. I need to add a route to get ALL tasks (for the tasks list page), plus a `DELETE` endpoint.\n\n2. **Redux Slice**: Create `tasksSlice.ts` for the tasks list page with:\n   - `fetchAllTasks()` - GET all tasks\n   - `fetchTaskClients()` - GET clients for dropdown\n   - `fetchTaskUsers()` - GET users for dropdown\n   - `createTask()` - POST new task\n   - `updateTaskStatus()` - PUT update task status\n   - `deleteTask()` - DELETE task\n   - `fetchClientDeals()` - GET deals for a client (for the modal)\n\n3. **Components**:\n   - `TasksListHeader` - Page title \"Upcoming Tasks\" + \"New Task\" button\n   - `TasksFilter` - Filter control with dropdown (Priority, Status, Assignee, Client) + search input\n   - `TaskCardList` - Task cards with priority badge, title, due date, assignee info, actions menu\n   - `CreateTaskModal` - Modal form to create a new task\n\n4. **Page**: Build the main tasks list page that ties everything together.\n\n5. **Store**: Add `tasksReducer` to store.ts\n\nNow I'm ready to start implementing. I'll begin by updating the backend to support fetching all tasks and deleting them, then create the Redux slice, build out each component, write the page, update the store, and add the styling.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3780,"cache_read_input_tokens":89407,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3780,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":12,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bad320f7-4e89-4421-a971-627ae1337f0d","uuid":"5c3a22d2-a7cb-4b51-b788-7bae0f7793e0"}
