My job is to unpack the \"Implement package scripts\" subtask into individual items for each script and queue them up, then I'm done—I shouldn't implement them myself.\n\nLet me check if `migrate-db.ts` and `seed-db.ts` exist, since `deploy.md` references them.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7193,"cache_read_input_tokens":27494,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7193,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"eaa4ac2f-1587-405b-bc5d-2091d4e9eaca","uuid":"f41512f8-9b9e-45ea-9680-e710bd4d6d64"}
