Let me analyze each one and write the analysis files. Let me summarize what I found in each log:\n\n**Log 20**: Task was testSpec.md - PlanPageTransactions (writing test entries for TransactionsPage). Shell commands used:\n1. `ls -la /repo` - exploring directories\n2. `ls -la /repo/apps` - exploring directories\n3. `ls -la /repo/tasks` - exploring directories\n4. `find /repo/apps/InventoryTracker -name \"AppSpec.md\" -o -name \"AppRevisions.md\" -o -name \"tests.md\" | head -20` - finding files\n\n\n5. Then continued searching for specification and revision files using various grep and find commands to locate the right documentation files in the InventoryTracker app directory.\n6. Checking what apps exist in the repo and examining the file structure, then verifying the actual file types to make sure I'm looking at the right documents.\n7. Downloaded a mockup image and started analyzing the test documentation by counting and categorizing test entries across different sections.\n8. Ran into repeated API errors when trying to process the test specifications and check various page directives - the system failed multiple times on tasks related to PlanPageTransactions and BatchDetailPage before giving up. Looking more carefully at the logs, I need to identify which ones actually executed shell commands versus just using the read/glob/grep tools. Log 20 through 27 show a pattern of repeated API errors, but I should verify which tasks actually ran shell commands by checking for the `$` prefix markers in the output. I'm running through a series of shell commands to locate and examine the AppSpec, AppRevisions, and test files across the repository structure, then downloading a specific image file and parsing test data from a large file to count and sort test entries.\n\nNow I'm checking for task configuration files and examining the app directory structure before reading in a specific task configuration to prepare for writing out the analysis files in
