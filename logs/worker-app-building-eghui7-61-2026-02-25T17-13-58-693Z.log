If the bug is about existing functionality, the test entries are\n   underspecified and the problem stage is `testSpec.md` (`skills/tasks/build/`) which covers generation of the spec.\n\n## Updating directives\n\nIf no problem stage was identified for the bug report, skip this subtask.\n\nRead the skill file for the stage which breaks down how to perform the stage into\nincreasingly small and well defined subtasks. These skill files have directives for things to watch\nfor when performing a subtask, which are reviewed afterwards and while maintaining the app to make sure\nthey are all being followed.\n\nCheck to see if the directives already prohibit the bad behavior. If so, add a note on the entry in\nbugReports.md but make no other changes.\n\nIf there is no directive against the bad behavior, add one or update any similar / conflicting directive.\nAdd a note on the entry in bugReports.md about the update made.\n\nDirectives should be general purpose and not include details or examples specific to the app being built.\n\n## Finishing bugs\n\nUpdate `docs/bugReports.md` to move the report from the \"Unreviewed\" section to the \"Finished\" section,\ncreating it at the end if necessary.\n\nMove the report from \"Unreviewed\" to \"Finished\" in `docs/bugReports.md`.\n","numLines":73,"startLine":1,"totalLines":73}}}
