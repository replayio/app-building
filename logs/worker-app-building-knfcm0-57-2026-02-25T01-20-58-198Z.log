Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    97→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    98→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    99→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   100→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   101→\n   102→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   103→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   104→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   105→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   106→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   107→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   108→\n   109→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   110→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   111→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   112→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   113→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   114→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   115→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   116→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   117→\n   118→## Parallel Test Design\n   119→\n   120→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   121→Write tests with this in mind:\n   122→\n   123→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   124→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   125→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   126→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   127→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   128→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   129→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   130→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   131→  being unmodified.\n   132→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   133→  you need to interact with.\n   134→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   135→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   136→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   137→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   138→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   139→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   140→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   141→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   142→\n   143→## Tips\n   144→\n   145→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   146→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   147→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   148→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   149→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   150→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   151→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   152→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   153→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   154→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"df852bbf-dea6-4a14-9d4a-64c1c633d656","uuid":"c7fa7858-b28d-4438-b5b7-df1a43658508","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":154,"startLine":1,"totalLines":154}}}

({ page }) => {\n    // Test implementation\n  });\n});\n```\n\n2. **Navigation & Waiting:**\n```typescript\nawait page.goto(\"/calendar\");  // Navigate to route\nawait expect(page.getByTestId(\"calendar-page\")).toBeVisible({ timeout: 30000 });\n```\n\n3. **Test ID Queries (Primary Method):**\n```typescript\npage.getByTestId(\"calendar-header\")           // Direct element\npage.getByTestId(\"calendar-page-title\")       // Component elements\npage.locator('[data-testid^=\"event-card-\"]')  // Dynamic prefixed IDs\npage.getByTestId(\"calendar-status-filter-btn\") // Button elements\n```\n\n4. **Assertions:**\n```typescript\nawait expect(element).toBeVisible();\nawait expect(element).toHaveText(\"text\");\nawait expect(element).toHaveAttribute(\"attr\", \"value\");\nawait expect(element).toHaveClass(/class-pattern/);\nawait expect(element).toContainText(\"text\");\nawait expect(element).toHaveValue(\"value\");\nawait expect(locator).toHaveCount(n);\n```\n\n5. **User Interactions:**\n```typescript\nawait element.click();\nawait element.fill(\"text\");\nawait element.clear();\n```\n\n6. **Persistence Testing Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Create something\n// Verify it appears\n// Navigate away and back\nawait page.goto(\"/calendar\");\nawait page.goto(\"/recipes\");\n// Verify it still exists\n```\n\n7. **Slow Tests:**\n```typescript\ntest.slow();  // Marks test as slow for extended timeout\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Routing**\n**File:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/App.tsx`\n\n```typescript\nRoute path=\"/\"                  → Redirects to /recipes\nRoute path=\"/recipes\"           → RecipesPage\nRoute path=\"/recipe/:recipeId\"  → RecipeDetailsPage\nRoute path=\"/calendar\"          → CalendarPage (WHERE CAL TESTS GO)\nRoute path=\"/runs/:runId\"       → RunDetailsPage\nRoute path=\"/equipment\"         → EquipmentPage\nRoute path=\"/equipment/:id\"     → EquipmentDetailsPage\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Calendar Page Architecture**\n\n**CalendarPage Component** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/pages/CalendarPage.tsx`):\n- Manages state: currentDate, view (Daily/Weekly/Monthly), statusFilter, selectedRun\n- Handles navigation: prev/next (view-aware), today button\n- Handles reschedule via drag-drop\n- Contains 3 child components:\n  1. `CalendarHeader` - Controls and filters\n  2. `CalendarGrid` - Grid/calendar display\n  3. `RunDetailsPopup` - Modal when event is clicked\n\n**CalendarHeader Component** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx`):\n- Page title: \"Production Calendar\"\n- Navigation buttons: Prev, Today, Next (with month/year label)\n- View toggle: Daily, Weekly, Monthly (Monthly default)\n- Status filter dropdown (All, On Track, Material Shortage, Scheduled, In Progress, Pending Approval)\n- Legend (color coding)\n- \"New Production Run\" button\n- Test IDs: `calendar-header`, `calendar-page-title`, `calendar-view-{daily|weekly|monthly}`, `calendar-status-filter-btn`\n\n**CalendarGrid Component** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarGrid.tsx`):\n- Displays calendar based on view\n- Monthly: 7-column grid (Sun-Sat) with day cells\n- Weekly: 7-day columns with time slots\n- Daily: Single day with time slots\n- Event cards with status colors\n- Supports multi-day events (spanning)\n- Drag-and-drop reschedule with confirmation\n- Click to open RunDetailsPopup\n\n**RunDetailsPopup Component** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/RunDetailsPopup.tsx`):\n- Modal showing production run details\n- Displays: Title (Recipe), Start/End dates, Quantity, Status, Materials list, Notes\n- Edit Run button (navigates to /runs/:runId)\n- Close button\n- Click outside to close\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Key Test Data & Patterns**\n\nFrom existing recipes-page.spec.ts, you'll see test data includes:\n- **Recipes:** \"Organic Granola Mix\", \"Cashew Butter Creamy\", \"Fruit Preserve\", \"Trail Mix Classic\", \"Almond Butter Smooth\", etc.\n- **Status values:** Active, Draft, Archived\n- **Test pattern:** CAL-PREFIX-# (e.g., CAL-HDR-1)\n- **Page interactions:** Click, fill, select, drag, navigate\n- **Verification:** Visibility, text content, CSS classes, persistence\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Required Test IDs for Calendar Tests**\n\nBased on component structure, you'll need these data-testids in components:\n\n**CalendarHeader:**\n- `calendar-header`\n- `calendar-page-title` \n- `calendar-prev-btn`\n- `calendar-today-btn`\n- `calendar-next-btn`\n- `calendar-period-label`\n- `calendar-view-daily`, `calendar-view-weekly`, `calendar-view-monthly`\n- `new-production-run-btn`\n- `calendar-status-filter-btn`\n- `calendar-status-dropdown`\n- `calendar-status-option-{all|on-track|material-shortage|scheduled|in-progress|pending-approval}`\n- `calendar-legend`\n\n**CalendarGrid:**\n- `calendar-grid`\n- `calendar-day-headers` (for day-of-week column headers)\n- `calendar-day-cell-{date}` or `calendar-cell-{dayNumber}`\n- `event-card-{runId}` or similar for event cards\n- `event-status-{status}` for status indicators\n\n**RunDetailsPopup:**\n- `run-details-popup`\n- `run-details-title`\n- `run-details-start-date`\n- `run-details-end-date`\n- `run-details-quantity`\n- `run-details-status`\n- `run-details-materials`\n- `run-details-notes`\n- `run-details-edit-btn`\n- `run-details-close-btn`\n\n---\n\n### 11.

I need to create three test files:\n1. `calendar-header.spec.ts` - for CAL-HDR tests\n2. `calendar-grid.spec.ts` - for CAL-GRID tests  \n3. `calendar-popup.spec.ts` - for CAL-POP tests\n\nActually, looking at the existing test structure, there's one file `recipes-page.spec.ts` for the entire RecipesPage. I could follow the same pattern and create `calendar-page.spec.ts` for all calendar tests, but the skill says \"Add one task per page, containing all test entries for that page\". \n\nThe subtasks are already defined for me, so I just need to write the tests. With 51 subtasks total, splitting them across separate spec files for each component makes sense, even though it diverges from the single-file pattern used for recipes. The parallel execution with separate workers might actually help with database isolation.\n\nBut looking at the existing pattern more carefully, everything for RecipesPage stays in one file despite having multiple describe blocks. I should probably follow that same convention and put all the calendar tests in a single `calendar-page.spec.ts` file with three describe blocks for the different components.\n\nActually, the parallel execution guidance suggests splitting into separate files would be better for performance. Let me go with that approach instead.\n\nNow I need to understand what test data is available. I should check the seed data and Netlify functions to see what production runs exist in the database, since the calendar tests will depend on that real data.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3422,"cache_read_input_tokens":87922,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3422,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"df852bbf-dea6-4a14-9d4a-64c1c633d656","uuid":"4ebedee8-a8f8-42e0-9c2a-caab513c9134"}

Ready to proceed.\"\n\n\n4. **Organic Granola Mix run 2** - Mar 3, 2026 08:00-16:00, 600 kg, Status: Scheduled, Notes: \"Increased quantity for spring demand.\"\n5. **Protein Energy Bar run 2** - Mar 10, 2026 07:00-15:00, 250 kg, Status: Material Shortage, Notes: \"Waiting on whey protein delivery. Expected March 7.\"\n6. **Trail Mix Classic run** - Mar 15, 2026 08:00-14:00, 200 kg, Status: Pending Approval, Notes: \"First production run for new product line.\"\n\nNow I'm reviewing the calendar header test specifications to understand what needs to be validated. The tests cover the title display, navigation buttons, and month/year formatting—since we're in February 2026, the header should reflect that current date rather than the example July 2024 shown in the spec.\n\nBeyond the header, there are tests for the view toggle between daily, weekly, and monthly modes with monthly as the default, plus the new production run button and its form modal. The filter by status dropdown needs to work correctly, showing and hiding runs based on the selected status or displaying all when \"All\" is chosen, and there's a legend that displays the color coding system.\n\nI'm also starting to look at the grid tests section to see what validation is needed for the calendar grid itself. L-GRID-1: Monthly grid shows day-of-week headers\n- CAL-GRID-2: Monthly grid shows day cells with numbers\n- CAL-GRID-3: Event cards on correct dates\n- CAL-GRID-4: Event cards show product, recipe, quantity, status\n- CAL-GRID-5: On Track events green with checkmark\n- CAL-GRID-6: Material Shortage events red/pink with warning\n- CAL-GRID-7: Scheduled events yellow\n- CAL-GRID-8: In Progress events teal/cyan\n- CAL-GRID-9: Pending Approval events amber/orange\n- CAL-GRID-10: Multi-day events span cells\n- CAL-GRID-11: Clicking event opens popup\n- CAL-GRID-12: Multiple events stacked\n- CAL-GRID-13: Empty day cells\n- CAL-GRID-14: Drag-drop to reschedule\n- CAL-GRID-15: Drag-drop cancel\n- CAL-GRID-16: Weekly view layout\n- CAL-GRID-17: Daily view layout\n\nNow I'm checking the popup behavior—it should display the recipe name as the title, along with start and end times, quantity, status, and material stock levels. The popup also needs to show notes and provide an Edit Run button that navigates to the run details page.\n\nI'm finishing the remaining popup tests: close button functionality, handling empty notes, material shortage indicators, and closing when clicking outside. Now I need to adapt these test specs to match the actual seed data we're using. Since the specs reference July 2024 but we're working with February-March 2026 data, I'll update the dates accordingly and use the real recipes and products from our seed data. I'm planning to organize the tests into three separate spec files covering the calendar header, grid, and popup functionality.\n\nLooking at the available runs in the seed data, I can see we have production runs scheduled across late February 2026: an Organic Granola Mix completed on the 24th, a Protein Energy Bar scheduled for the 26th, and a Strawberry Preserve confirmed for the 27th.\n\nContinuing into March, there's another Granola Mix run on the 3rd that's scheduled, an Energy Bar run on the 10th facing a material shortage, and a Trail Mix run on the 15th pending approval. The issue is that none of these runs have \"On Track\" or \"In Progress\" statuses, which some test specs expect, so I'll need to either create those statuses in the test setup or find existing runs with the right CSS classes to verify against.\n\nLooking at how the event cards format the data, they display the product name, recipe, quantity, unit, and status all together. Now I'm noticing the test specs reference July 2024 dates, but our seed data is from February and March 2026. I need to adjust the test expectations to match what's actually in the system. For the header test, instead of checking for \"July 2024\", I should verify it shows \"February 2026\" since that's the current date. Similarly, when testing the navigation buttons, clicking Prev from February should take us to January 2026, not June 2024.\n\nFor the grid tests, the specs mention a Widget-A production run on July 1, 2024, but our actual seed data has runs scattered across late February and mid-March 2026. I'm also realizing there are some gaps in the test coverage—the seed data doesn't include any \"On Track\" or \"In Progress\" status runs, and all the existing runs are single-day events rather than spanning multiple days. I'll need to either create additional test data or find a way to work with what's available.\n\nLooking at the timestamps more carefully, every run starts and ends on the same calendar day, so I'll need to either modify one of the existing runs to span multiple days or add a new one to properly test that scenario.\n\nFor the other test cases, I'm missing runs with \"On Track\" and \"In Progress\" statuses entirely, so I'll need to create those in the test setup. And for the stacked events scenario, the current seed data doesn't have multiple runs on the same day, so I'll need to either adjust the dates or add additional runs to create that overlap.\n\nFor the drag-drop tests, I can work with an existing run. But for the notes-related tests, I'm noticing mismatches—the \"Priority order\" note doesn't exist in the seed data, and there's no run without notes, so I'll need to either adapt the test expectations or create the missing data.\n\nRun 5 has the Material Shortage status I need, and I can see it has two forecasts showing shortages in Whey Protein Powder and Chocolate Coating, which should trigger the shortage indicators the test is looking for.\n\nNow I'm ready to write out all three test files, making sure each test title matches exactly as specified while adapting the

Let me create the todo list and start writing tests.\n\nLet me plan:\n\n1. Write `tests/calendar-header.spec.ts` - 20 tests for CAL-HDR-1 through CAL-HDR-20\n2. Write `tests/calendar-grid.spec.ts` - 17 tests for CAL-GRID-1 through CAL-GRID-17\n3. Write `tests/calendar-popup.spec.ts` - 14 tests for CAL-POP-1 through CAL-POP-14\n\nKey seed data to reference:\n\n\n- Today: Feb 25, 2026 → default calendar shows \"February 2026\"\n- Feb 2026 runs: Granola (24th, Completed), Energy Bar (26th, Scheduled), Strawberry Jam (27th, Confirmed)\n- Mar 2026 runs: Granola (3rd, Scheduled), Energy Bar (10th, Material Shortage), Trail Mix (15th, Pending Approval)\n\nStatuses available: Completed, Scheduled, Confirmed, Material Shortage, Pending Approval. I notice I'm missing On Track and In Progress statuses, which I'll need to add for tests like CAL-GRID-5.\n\nFor the remaining test coverage, I need to create multi-day runs for CAL-GRID-10, add a second event on an existing date for CAL-GRID-12, find or create a run without notes for CAL-POP-12, and I can leverage the Material Shortage run on March 10th for CAL-POP-13. Now I'm writing the three test files, being careful to match test titles exactly, use the correct data-testids from components, adapt dates to the seed data, apply generous timeouts, and avoid hardcoded values.\n\nI'm deciding between parallelizing with agents versus writing them myself—given the need for consistent data-testid values across all files, I'll write them directly. Let me structure the calendar-header, calendar-grid, and calendar-popover test files...\n\nWriting test files... Writing test cases... Writing test cases...\n\nI'm realizing the actual current date is February 25, 2026, not July 2024 as mentioned in the spec, so the calendar will display February 2026 by default. This means the navigation tests need to account for the correct month transitions: clicking Prev should show January 2026, and clicking Next should show March 2026.\n\nThe bigger issue is that I can't hardcode these dates since the tests need to work whenever they're run. I should compute the expected month values dynamically from the actual current date at test runtime, and for tests that reference specific events in the seed data, I'll need to navigate to the correct months in February and March 2026 where those events actually exist. I need to adapt the tests to work with the actual seed data rather than the placeholder examples in the spec. Since the calendar shows whatever month is current when tests run, I'll navigate to February or March 2026 to ensure the seeded runs are visible, then write the test files to interact with real event data.\n\nWriting the three test files now... label shows current month/year → dynamic\nCAL-HDR-6: Prev → shows previous month → click prev, check label changed\nCAL-HDR-7: Next → shows next month → click next, check label changed\nCAL-HDR-8: Today → goes back to current month → navigate away, click today, check\nCAL-HDR-9: View toggle buttons visible\nCAL-HDR-10: Monthly is default selected\nCAL-HDR-11: Daily toggle → single day view + period label changes + prev/next by day\nCAL-HDR-12: Weekly toggle → week view + period label changes + prev/next by week\nCAL-HDR-13: Monthly toggle → back to monthly view\nCAL-HDR-14: New Production Run button visible\nCAL-HDR-15: New Production Run button opens form and creates run\nCAL-HDR-16: Filter by Status dropdown visible and functional with options that hide non-matching runs\nCAL-HDR-17: \"All\" option shows everything again\nCAL-HDR-18: Legend displays the color coding for different statuses\nCAL-GRID-1: Day-of-week headers Sun-Sat\nCAL-GRID-2: Day cells with numbers (navigate to known month)\nCAL-GRID-3: Event cards on correct dates\nCAL-GRID-4: Event cards show correct format\nCAL-GRID-5: On Track → green (need to create On Track run)\nCAL-GRID-6: Material Shortage → red/pink (navigate to Mar 2\n\n026, check run 5)\nCAL-GRID-7: Scheduled → yellow (Feb 2026 has Scheduled run on 26th)\nCAL-GRID-8: In Progress → teal (need to create In Progress run)\nCAL-GRID-9: Pending Approval → amber (navigate to Mar 2026, run 6 on 15th)\nCAL-GRID-10: Multi-day events span correctly (need to create multi-day run)\nCAL-GRID-11: Clicking event opens popup\nCAL-GRID-12: Multiple events stacked on same day (need to create 2 runs on same day)\nCAL-GRID-13: Empty day cell displays properly\nCAL-GRID-14: Drag-drop reschedule (slow test)\nCAL-GRID-15: Drag-drop cancel\nCAL-GRID-16: Weekly view layout\nCAL-GRID-17: Daily view layout\n\nNow I'm looking at the popup test cases, covering the event details modal with recipe name, timing, quantity, status, materials with stock levels, notes, and edit functionality, plus interactions like closing and detecting material shortages.\n\nFor tests that need specific statuses like \"On Track\" or \"In Progress\" that aren't in the seed data, I can create a run through the API and then update its status. The create endpoint defaults to \"Scheduled\", but the update endpoint lets me change it. Since the CalendarGrid already supports all statuses with the right CSS classes and the getEventClass function handles the different states, runs with those statuses should render correctly in the grid.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the createRun thunk actually passes a status parameter to the API...\n\nExamining the thunk definition...\n\nLooking at the server-side destructuring, status is indeed extracted from the request body, so if I include it in the POST payload, it'll be used instead of defaulting to \"Scheduled\". The frontend thunk doesn't currently support passing status, but I can work around this by making direct API calls in tests that need specific statuses, or I could modify the thunk to accept an optional status field.\n\nSince the seed data doesn't include On Track or In Progress runs, I'll need to create them during the tests. I could either use direct API calls via `page.request.post()` or update the seed data itself to include these statuses from the start.\n\nThe cleanest approach is to create the necessary data within each test using API calls—this keeps tests isolated and follows the parallel design pattern. For navigation tests, I'll either click through months or rely on the default February 2026 data that's already seeded.\n\nOne thing I need to account for: the test runner could execute at any time, but the seed data is fixed to February-March 2026, so I should avoid hardcoding date assumptions that might break if tests run in different months.\n\nI'll take a pragmatic approach—for tests that just need some event to exist, I'll create runs dynamically via API with dates relative to the current date, and for UI-only checks, I'll work with whatever month is currently displayed. For the grid and popup specs, I'll need to create test data with various statuses via the API, though I can lean on existing seed data when it's sufficient. The key insight is that I should create runs with dates in the current month so the tests work regardless of when they're executed—that way the events will already be visible in the default calendar view without needing to navigate elsewhere.\n\nI'm checking whether the POST endpoint accepts a status field directly, and looking at how the Netlify function handles the request body...\n\nStill writing test setup... I need to be careful about cleanup since runs are stored server-side and will persist across tests in the same worker. I'll delete each run via the API after the test completes to keep the dataset clean, and I'll structure each test to create its data upfront and tear it down afterward. I'll take a pragmatic approach: create test data at the start of each test, capture the ID from the response, run assertions, then delete it at the end. Now I'm ready to write all three spec files sequentially—calendar-header, calendar-grid, and calendar-popup—since they need consistent data-testid naming. The seed data has runs in February and March 2026, so I'll use those months for navigation testing.\n\nFor tests that need visible events, I could navigate to find seed data, but that's fragile if tests run at different times. Instead, I'll create fresh test data in the current month via API for each test that needs it—this keeps tests independent and robust, even if it's slightly slower. For tests specifically checking seed data features like material shortage indicators, I'll navigate to the appropriate month where that data exists.\n\nActually, since the worker system runs tests close to the seed time and we're already in late February 2026 with seed data in Feb-Mar, the default calendar view should show events. I'll keep it simple and just navigate to February 2026 when needed using a helper that checks the period label and clicks prev/next accordingly. Looking at how the existing recipe tests work, they don't do any date navigation—they just load the page and interact with what's there, so I should follow that same pattern.\n\nNow I'm ready to start writing the actual tests. Let me work through the specific test cases systematically.\n\nFor CAL-GRID-3, I need to adapt the placeholder data to match what's actually in the seed data—there's a Granola production run completed on February 24th that I can use instead.\n\nCAL-GRID-5 requires an \"On Track\" event with a green background, but the seed data doesn't have any runs with that status, so I'll need to create one. CAL-GRID-6 is testing for \"Material Shortage\" events in red/pink, which corresponds to run 5 in March—I'll need to navigate forward to verify that. CAL-GRID-7 should be straightforward since run 2 on February 26th is already marked as Scheduled with a yellow background. CAL-GRID-8 needs an \"In Progress\" event, which also isn't in the seed data, so I'll need to create that as well.\n\nFor CAL-GRID-9, there's a \"Pending Approval\" event (run 6 in March) that I'll need to navigate to. CAL-GRID-10 requires a multi-day event spanning multiple days, which doesn't exist in the seed data, so I'll create one. CAL-GRID-11 is just clicking an event to open the popup—I can use any visible event for that. CAL-GRID-12 tests stacking multiple events on the same day; since February 24th only has one run, I could either create another run on that date via API or find a month where this naturally occurs. CAL-GRID-14 will test drag-and-drop rescheduling by moving an event from one date to another.\n\nNow I'm ready to write the test files. I initially thought about using Task agents to parallelize the work, but there's too much shared context and consistency needed across the tests, so I'll write them myself to ensure everything aligns properly.\n\nI'm starting with the header tests and need to be careful about date formatting. The formatPeriodLabel function handles three formats: monthly shows \"February 2026\", daily shows \"February 25, 2026\", and weekly shows a range like \"Feb 23 - Mar 1, 2026\" for the week containing that date. Let me verify the week calculation for February 25, 2026—that's a Wednesday, so the week should run from Sunday February 22 through Saturday February 28.\n\nChecking the getWeekDates function...\n\nStill verifying date logic...\n\nActually, I should make the tests more robust by dynamically computing the period labels rather than hardcoding them. I can navigate through the calendar and verify the labels change without needing to know the exact dates in advance. Let me also check that all the necessary test IDs are present in the components before writing the test files.\n\nVerifying test IDs... Continuing through the CalendarGrid component, I'm verifying the remaining test IDs for the legend items, day cells, event elements, and the reschedule tooltip with its action buttons. Continuing through the RunDetailsPopup component, I'm verifying all the class names for the quantity, status, materials section, and action buttons. Moving into NewRunModal now, checking the modal wrapper and close button, then the recipe input field.\n\nFinished verifying all the testids in NewRunModal—the recipe options, date fields, quantity and unit inputs, notes, and action buttons are all accounted for. Now I'm spot-checking the calendar page testid to make sure that's in place too.\n\nNow I need to write out the three test files. But first, let me double-check the date formatting expectations against what CalendarHeader actually produces. For a single-day view, it should show the full date like \"February 25, 2026\", and for weekly it'll be a range like \"Feb 22 - Feb 28, 2026\". I want to make sure my tests align with those exact formats.\n\nFor testing the navigation behavior, I'll keep it straightforward: switch to Daily view, verify the period label format, click Prev, and confirm the label changed to reflect the previous day. I don't need to compute exact dates—just checking that the format is correct and the value changed is enough to validate the navigation is working.\n\nNow I'm ready to write out all 51 tests efficiently. For the drag-and-drop test, I'll use Playwright's drag functionality to move an event from one day cell to another.\n\nWriting drag-and-drop test... I'm deciding whether to parallelize the test writing across multiple agents or just write them myself to maintain consistency with the data-testid values and test structure. Given that the tests need to be cohesive and reference the same selectors, I'll write them directly using the write tool rather than delegating to separate agents.\n\nNow I'm working through the specific test cases—for the production run creation test, I'll model it after the existing recipe header test since they follow similar patterns. For the filter tests, I need to account for the different event statuses visible in February 2026 to properly verify the filtering behavior. I see that \"Completed\" and \"Confirmed\" aren't even in the filter dropdown—only \"Scheduled\" matches what's available in February. For the filter tests, I should navigate to March where all the relevant statuses exist: \"Scheduled\" on the 3rd, \"Material Shortage\" on the 10th, and \"Pending Approval\" on the 15th. That way I can properly test filtering by each status without dealing with the mismatch between the seed data and available filter options.\n\nFor the grid status tests, I've identified which runs to use: \"Scheduled\" and \"Material Shortage\" are already in February and March respectively, and \"Pending Approval\" is in March. But I still need to create test data for \"On Track\" and \"In Progress\" statuses since they don't exist in the current seed data. After clicking Next to reach March, I'll verify the period label updates correctly before running the filter tests.\n\nTo set up the missing runs, I'm making API calls to create them with the appropriate status values, then reloading the page so the calendar picks up the newly created data. navigate to /calendar\n\nActually, looking at the calendar page, it dispatches `fetchRuns()` in useEffect on mount. So if I navigate to /calendar after creating the run, it should fetch the new data.\n\nLet me plan out the test flow: I'll create a run via the API, navigate to the calendar page, wait for it to load, assert the new run appears, then clean it up by deleting it through the API.\n\nThe baseURL in the Playwright config is \"http://localhost:8888\", so I can use relative URLs with `page.request` instead of the full path.\n\nNow I need to write the test for the New Production Run modal. This involves opening the modal, selecting a recipe from a search dropdown (which requires clicking to focus, typing to search, then clicking the result), filling in dates and quantity, submitting, and verifying the event appears on the calendar and persists.\n\nWriting the recipe selection logic... I need to adapt the test to work with actual seed data and dates. The datetime-local inputs need the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm, so I'll use \"2026-02-15T08:00\" for the start date and \"2026-02-15T17:00\" for the end time on February 15th. The quantity field is a number input, so I can fill it with \"500\". Now I'll write out all three test files with these concrete values.\n\nI'm estimating the file sizes—roughly 20 tests for the header, 17 for the grid, and 14 for the popup, with each test running 10-30 lines, so I'm looking at 200-600 lines per file, which is manageable. I need to handle the multi-day event case for CAL-GRID-10, so I'll create one spanning from February 9th (Monday) through February 13th (Friday) in the seed data. the spec says \"a production run for 'Super-Widget (Recipe v3.5)' is scheduled from Monday July 8 to Friday July 12\". I'll adapt to create a multi-day event spanning Mon-Fri in the current month.\n\nActually, for the current month (February 2026):\n- Feb 1: Sunday\n- Feb 2: Monday\n- Feb 9: Monday\n- Feb 13: Friday\n- Feb 16: Monday\n- Feb 20: Friday\n\nSo a multi-day event from Feb 9 to Feb 13 would span Mon-Fri (5 days).\n\nBut I need to consider the date format: the calendar grid uses `calendar-day-YYYY-MM-DD` testids. So I need to know which cells to check.\n\nFor a multi-day event from Feb 9 to Feb 13:\n- It should span 5 cells: Feb 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n\nNow I'm looking at how the CalendarGrid handles multi-day events. It calculates the visible span within each week row, determining how many days to display based on the day of the week and remaining days in that week. The event only renders on the start day for multi-day events, with logic to handle week row continuations.\n\nFor testing, I need to verify the event appears on the start date with the correct spanning width style applied. I'm verifying the spanning behavior by checking that the event card has the span class and appears on the start date with a calculated width that accounts for multiple cells. Rather than testing computed CSS values which is tricky in Playwright, I'll just confirm the class is applied and the element is visible. Now I'll write out all three test files directly instead of delegating to

Let me fix this and the similar pattern in CAL-POP-13.\n\nFor CAL-POP-6, the issue is that we're waiting for material items to load. I can instead use a simpler approach: wait for either material items OR the no-materials message to be visible. Since at least one will appear, I can use `expect().toBeVisible()` on one or the other.\n\nActually, the simplest fix: since the popup will show materials (because it fetches by run ID), and any event we click will be from seed data that has recipe materials, I can just wait for material items to appear.\n\n\nThe first event on the calendar in Feb 2026 is on the 24th (Completed - Organic Granola Mix), which definitely has recipe materials, so the popup should load them. Since materials are fetched asynchronously, I'll just verify the materials section has content without using the problematic `.toPass()` with `count()` pattern.\n\nI'm using Playwright's `.or()` method to check that either material items or the \"No materials\" message appears, which avoids the nested auto-wait issue.

The `count()` calls are not inside a retry block. However, the approach could be fragile - the DOM might not have finished updating when we get `filteredCount`. But since we're using `await` with Playwright and the filter dropdown closes synchronously, this should be OK.\n\nActually, there's a subtle issue: after clicking the \"Material Shortage\" filter option, the filter applies synchronously (it's client-side state). But the events might not have finished re-rendering. Let me add a small wait/assertion before counting.\n \nLooking at the flow more carefully, the filter state updates synchronously when we click the option, triggering a re-render of the CalendarGrid with only the filtered events. The `toHaveCount` assertion has built-in retry logic, so even though we're calling `count()` directly on line 375, the subsequent assertion will keep retrying until the count actually changes when we reset the filter back to \"all\".\n\nFor CAL-GRID-2, each `expect` statement checking visibility is a standalone assertion rather than being wrapped in `.toPass()`, so that should work fine. But I'm concerned about CAL-POP-14 — when we click the overlay at position `{ x: 10, y: 10 }` to close the popup, we might actually be clicking on the popup itself rather than the overlay background.\n\nLooking at the component structure, the overlay is the outer container with the `onClick` handler that calls `onClose`, and the popup content sits inside with `stopPropagation` to prevent clicks from bubbling up. Since the popup is typically centered, clicking at the top-left corner should hit the overlay background and work correctly. Though I'm realizing there might be some nuance to how Playwright's `click()` method resolves the target element when the overlay contains the popup.\n\nFor the drag-and-drop tests, I need to verify that the CalendarGrid component properly handles the drag lifecycle—setting transfer data on drag start, allowing drops with the drag-over state, and then processing the drop event itself. I'm realizing there's a timing issue with the test—it assumes the current month is February 2026, but if tests run at a different time, clicking Next once won't reliably land on March 2026. The test spec doesn't actually require March 2026 specifically, just a month with multiple status events visible, so I should make the navigation more flexible to handle whenever the tests run. The recipe tests rely on seed data without creating dynamic test data, so the calendar tests can do the same—they'll work fine when run during the expected timeframe in February-March 2026. I'm already verifying the period label after navigation in CAL-HDR-18, which makes the test more robust than just assuming the click lands in the right month.\n\nVerifying the period label...\n\nActually, I realize this approach breaks if the test runs outside that window—if it's March when the test runs, clicking Next goes to April instead, and the assertion fails. The better fix is to create events dynamically in the current month rather than relying on seed data timing, so the tests work consistently regardless of when they're executed.","signature":"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

This test relies on:\n1. The current month being February 2026 (so clicking Next goes to March 2026)\n2. The seed data having the Protein Energy Bar Material Shortage run on March 10\n\nWhile not perfectly robust (if run in a different month), this test references actual seed data with forecasts that have shortage indicators. The forecasts are the key - without them, we can't test shortage indicators. Creating a new run wouldn't include forecasts.\n\nI could create forecasts via API too, but there's no API endpoint for that. \n\nThe forecasts only exist in seed data, so I need to use them. But I'm realizing the month assertion is fragile - it assumes the test runs in February 2026, otherwise clicking Next won't land on March. I should make this more robust by navigating directly to the period containing March 10, 2026 instead of relying on the current month. clicking Next once should work. If the test fails due to date drift, it would need to be updated anyway. I'll add a helper that loops through the calendar navigation, checking the period label against the target month and clicking either Next or Previous depending on how far off we are, with a safety limit of 24 iterations.\n\nWriting test helper... Finishing the loop logic to handle backward navigation, then verifying the calendar lands on March 2026. This approach calculates the exact month difference from today and clicks the appropriate button that many times, making the test reliable regardless of when it runs. I'll add this solution to the CAL-POP-13 test

[2026-02-25T01:20:21.343Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_013d4939azeWzAWUFyjpwRLa","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The popup tests (CAL-POP-1 through CAL-POP-11, and CAL-POP-14) all click the first visible event on the calendar. If the default month (current month) has no events, these would fail.\n\nThe seed data has events in Feb 2026 (on 24th, 26th, 27th). Since today is Feb 25, 2026, the default month view will show events from Feb 2026. So the tests should work.\n\nBut to be more robust, I could navigate to February 2026 specifically. Or I could create a test event for each of these tests. \n\nCreating events for 12 tests would be slow and repetitive, so I'll stick with relying on the seed data. The existing recipe tests don't add their own setup either—they just expect the data to be there. Since the seed data guarantees events in Feb 2026 and that's the current month during test runs, the tests should be stable. I'm starting to wonder though if there's an issue with how the first event is selected from the DOM when events are rendered across the monthly grid.\n\nThe grid includes cells from the previous month that are dimmed out, so any events on those dates wouldn't be current month events. Let me trace through the grid generation logic to understand how dates are laid out...\n\nExamining the grid generation...\n\nSince February 2026 starts on a Sunday, the grid begins right at February 1st with no overflow from January. So when I query for the first event card in the grid, it should be the earliest event in February, which is the Completed Organic Granola Mix on Feb 24. However, I need to verify that the calendar is actually filtering events by the selected status filter rather than showing all events at once. I'm checking the forecast logic for the first run—since it has no forecasts in the seed data, the popup will fall through to display the recipe materials instead, showing ingredients like Rolled Oats and Honey.\n\nFor the notes test, an empty string is falsy in the conditional, so it correctly renders the \"No notes\" placeholder text that the test is looking for.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the timezone handling. The seed data uses UTC timestamps with the Z suffix, and JavaScript's Date constructor interprets those as UTC. When the formatting function calls getHours() and other methods, they return values in the local timezone. Since the test environment is likely running in UTC, the timestamps should format consistently—for example, `2026-02-24T08:00:00Z` becomes \"Feb 24, 2026 08:00 AM\" and `2026-02-24T16:00:00Z` becomes \"Feb 24, 2026 04:00 PM\".\n\nMy regex pattern should match this format, and I'm checking the formatPopupDateTime function to see exactly how it constructs the output string with month abbreviations, day, year, hours in 12-hour format, minutes, and AM/PM designation.
