The modal has \"Cancel\" and \"Create\" (or \"Save\") buttons at the bottom.\n\n#### CreateTaskModal form validates required fields\n- **Initial state:** CreateTaskModal is open with all fields empty.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Create\" submit button without filling in any fields.\n- **Expected:** The form displays a validation error for the Title field indicating it is required. The task is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### CreateTaskModal successfully creates a task\n- **Initial state:** CreateTaskModal is open.\n- **Action:** User fills in: Title = \"Follow up with Acme Corp\", Description = \"Discuss renewal terms\", Due Date = tomorrow at 2:00 PM, Priority = \"High\", Client = \"Acme Corp\" (selected from dropdown), Assignee = \"Sarah J.\" (selected from users dropdown). User clicks the \"Create\" button.\n- **Expected:** The task is created via the API. The modal closes. The new task appears in the task list with a \"High\" priority badge, the title \"Follow up with Acme Corp\", the due date showing \"Due: Tomorrow, 2:00 PM\", and \"Sarah J.\" as the assignee. A timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline for the new task creation. If any user is following the client \"Acme Corp\", they receive a notification (if notification preferences allow).\n\n#### CreateTaskModal assignee dropdown shows team members\n- **Initial state:** CreateTaskModal is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the Assignee dropdown.\n- **Expected:** A searchable FilterSelect dropdown appears listing team members fetched from the users API.

No task is created. The task list remains unchanged.\n\n#### CreateTaskModal closes on overlay click\n- **Initial state:** CreateTaskModal is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the modal overlay (area outside the modal dialog).\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No task is created.\n\n### TasksListContent\n\n#### Page displays heading and New Task button\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /tasks.\n- **Expected:** The page displays a heading \"Upcoming Tasks\" at the top. A blue \"New Task\" button is displayed in the top-right corner of the page header. The sidebar \"Tasks\" link is highlighted as active.\n\n#### Loading state shows while tasks are being fetched\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /tasks and the API request for tasks is in progress.\n- **Expected:** A loading indicator (spinner or skeleton) is displayed in the task list area while data is being fetched. The filter bar and page header are still visible.\n\n#### Empty state shown when no tasks match filters\n- **Initial state:** TasksListPage is loaded. User applies filters that match no tasks (e.g., search for \"xyznonexistent\").\n- **Expected:** The task list area displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No tasks found\" or \"No matching tasks\") instead of task cards. The filter bar remains visible so the user can adjust filters.\n\n#### Empty state shown when no tasks exist\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /tasks and there are no tasks in the system.\n- **Expected:** The task list area displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No tasks yet\") with a prompt or button to create the first task. The \"New Task\" button remains visible in the header.\n\n#### Pagination controls appear when tasks exceed page size\n- **Initial state:** The system has more tasks than fit on a single page (e.g., more than 20 tasks).\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are displayed below the task list (e.g., \"Previous\" / \"Next\" buttons or page numbers).

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes.

It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019hroZBA6p9HiwGjER189LA","session_id":"c642117d-239b-4985-bf57-8f79a745abff","uuid":"dbbbbbde-4569-42ca-a7e2-12a2dcae4f96"}

Let me now systematically go through each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecTaskDetail\n\nThe testSpec.md directives require:\n- Test entries for every visible element\n- Test entries for every interactive element \n- BDD format (initial state, action, expected)\n- All entries must have titles\n- Grouped by page\n- Indicate components they exercise\n- Every interactive element must be tested\n\nThe TaskDetailPage section in docs/tests.md is completely **empty** - just `## TaskDetailPage (/tasks/:taskId)` with no content. According to the AppRevisions.md, the page should have:\n\n\n- Core task info display\n- Notes section\n- Task actions (mark complete, cancel)\n- Navigation from other pages\n\nThis is a clear violation - the TaskDetailPage has NO test entries at all.\n\n## Job 2: CheckComponentsTaskDetail\n\nThe writeApp.md directives require:\n- All JSX abstracted into React components\n- data-testid attributes on interactive elements\n- Must satisfy test entry requirements\n- Match visual appearance to mockups\n- p-6 max-sm:p-3 padding on root\n- And more...\n\nThe TaskDetailPage is just a stub with a heading, so it's clearly incomplete. Since there are no test entries to validate against, I need to check if the component structure itself meets the requirements.\n\n## Job 3: CheckTestsTaskDetail\n\nThe writeTests.md directives require:\n- Tests match test entry requirements\n- Test titles match test entry titles\n- Use data-testid\n- Verify navigation targets precisely\n- etc.\n\nThere are NO TaskDetail test files. Only `tasks-list.spec.ts` exists.\n\nSince there are no test entries in tests.md AND no test files AND the page is a stub, all three jobs essentially find the same core issue: TaskDetailPage hasn't been built yet.\n\nLooking at the violations more carefully, I'm seeing three distinct issues: TaskDetailPage lacks test entries in the docs, the component itself is just a stub, and there's no test file at all. But they all point to the same root problem—the page was never actually implemented. The strategy asks me to check for directive violations in existing work, not flag missing work, so I need to think about whether these count as violations or just incomplete features. The tips mention grouping related fix tasks together, which suggests I should organize these as connected issues stemming from the same unfinished work. so I need to create fix groups that follow the standard build pipeline—starting with test spec entries, then building the components, then writing the tests. The first group handles writing the test spec, and the second group will handle writing the components themselves. the TaskDetailPage components (follows writeApp.md strategy)\n3. Third group: Write tests for TaskDetailPage (follows writeTests.md strategy)\n\nLooking at the strategy more carefully, it says to use `add-group` with the checkDirectives strategy for fix groups, but since the entire page needs to be built from scratch rather than just fixed, I should use the proper build strategies instead—creating groups for test specs, app components, and tests in sequence. I need to figure out the right approach here. The checkDirectives strategy uses `add-group` with fix groups, but I'm realizing there's a dependency chain: test specs need to be written first, then the page components built from those specs, then the actual tests written. Let me just use the checkDirectives strategy as intended and let the fix groups handle the sequencing—the worker will understand what needs to happen in order. I realize the build strategies have unpacking sections that would create additional jobs, which might be overcomplicating things. Instead, I should use the checkDirectives strategy for these fix groups with clear descriptions of what needs to be built. I've already got the details from the explore agent about what TaskDetailPage requires—core task info, a notes section with add/delete functionality, and task actions—so I can move forward with setting up the work. fix groups.\n\nI'll structure the fix groups around the build pipeline since the page needs to be fully built:\n\nGroup 1: Write test spec entries for TaskDetailPage (testSpec.md strategy)\nGroup 2: Build TaskDetailPage components (writeApp.md strategy)  \nGroup 3: Write TaskDetailPage tests (writeTests.md strategy)\n\nActually, those strategies have their own unpacking logic that would create sub-jobs. Let me think about this differently.\n\nFor the testSpec strategy, PlanPage and PlanComponent jobs would be created. For writeApp, WriteComponent and WritePage jobs would be created. For writeTests, WriteTest jobs would be created.\n\nI think the cleanest approach is:\n\n1. Add a testSpec group to create test entries for TaskDetailPage\n2. Add a writeApp group to build the TaskDetailPage\n3. Add a writeTests group to write the tests\n\nThese should be added as trailing groups to execute in order after all current check jobs. But wait—the add-group script defaults to front of queue, not trailing. And if I add them to the front, they'll execute in reverse order. So I need to add them backwards: writeTests first, then writeApp, then testSpec, so that testSpec ends up at the front and runs first.\n\nOr I could just use the --trailing flag to add them to the end in the correct order.\n\nLooking at the instructions more carefully, I see the front strategy is for fix groups that need to happen before other work, but since I'm building a new page, trailing makes more sense to avoid blocking other checks. I'll add them as trailing groups: testSpec, writeApp, writeTests.\n\nActually, I should reconsider which strategy to use. The checkDirectives strategy has minimal guidance for fixing violations, while the build strategies offer much more detailed instructions for building pages from scratch. Since this is essentially a build task, I should use the build strategies instead. Looking at the expected job format from the unpack section, I need to structure the jobs with descriptive names that follow the pattern for planning pages and components.\n\nFor now, I can only add the testSpec group since I don't know the exact component names or test entries yet—those will emerge once the test spec is written. The writeApp and writeTests groups can be added later as subsequent maintenance checks or builds pick up the components and tests that get created.\n\nActually, the better approach is to add all three groups at once: a testSpec group to plan the test entries, a generic writeApp group to build the page, and a writeTests group to write the tests. Since writeApp and writeTests depend on testSpec output, I'll add them as trailing groups that run after testSpec completes.\n\nNow I'm constructing the commands to add each group with their respective jobs and strategies...\n\nActually, I should reconsider this approach. The strategy files themselves handle unpacking jobs into sub-tasks, so I don't need to manually create all the sub-jobs upfront. And looking at the checkDirectives pattern more carefully, it's designed for fixing violations rather than building something from scratch. The build workflow might need a different structure altogether—maybe I should focus on a simpler initial job and let the strategy handle the decomposition. Now I'll systematically work through each check and add the corresponding fix groups to address the
