This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9d3b6911-76ce-4102-bae2-7c6af177bf4f","uuid":"8b81e18d-ea83-447b-aa58-7887420c6aec","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-size: 14px;\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex / Value         |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —                   |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.05)` | ~5% warm black     |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(234, 231, 226)`     | `#eae7e2`          |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(242, 240, 236)`     | `#f2f0ec`          |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(230, 237, 232)`     | `#e6ede8`          |\n\nSelected row uses a very faint green tint to reinforce the accent color without being loud.\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: 4px;\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px 8px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(55, 52, 46);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background           | Description                  |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| Default | transparent          | No background                |\n| Hover   | rgb(235, 233, 228)   | `#ebe9e4` — warm subtle gray |\n| Active  | rgb(226, 224, 218)   | `#e2e0da` — slightly deeper  |\n\n### Active Nav Item (current page)\n\n```css\nbackground: rgb(226, 234, 229);  /* very faint green tint */\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#ddd9d3` — a warm gray rather than cool.\nHover border darkens to approximately `#c5c0b8`.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value | Usage                     |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| 4px   | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px   | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px   | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%   | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                    |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.15) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows use a warm-tinted black rather than pure black, keeping the overall palette cohesive.\n\n---\n\n## Transitions\n\n| Property         | Duration | Easing   | Usage                    |\n|------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|\n| background-color | 0.1s     | ease     | Fast hover interactions  |\n| opacity          | 0.2s     | ease-out | Standard fade-in/out     |\n| color            | 0.15s    | ease     | Text color shifts        |\n| fill             | 0.4s     | ease     | Icon color transitions   |\n\n---\n\n## CSS Custom Properties\n\n### Backgrounds & Colors\n`--bg-color`, `--bg-sidebar-color`, `--bg-base-color`, `--bg-border-color`, `--content-color-light`, `--content-highlight-color-light`\n\n### Interactive States\n`--normal-bg`, `--normal-border`, `--normal-border-hover`, `--normal-text`\n\n### Accent\n`--accent-primary: #4d7c5e`, `--accent-light: #5a8f6a`, `--accent-dark: #3e694e`, `--accent-muted: #6b8f7a`, `--accent-subtle-bg: #e6ede8`\n\n### Sizing\n`--sidebar-width` (240px), `--scrollbar-width` (12px), `--control-border-radius` (4px)\n\n---\n\n## Status Colors\n\nFor data-driven UIs that need status indicators (e.g., pipeline stages, priority levels):\n\n| Status     | Color     | Hex       | Notes                     |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Success    | Forest    | `#4d7c5e` | Matches primary accent    |\n| Warning    | Amber     | `#b08a3e` | Warm gold, not bright yellow |\n| Error      | Brick     | `#b05050` | Muted red, not alarming   |\n| Info       | Slate     | `#5a7a8a` | Cool blue-gray            |\n| Neutral    | Stone     | `#8a8580` | Warm gray                 |\n\nAll status colors are desaturated to fit the subdued palette. Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

I need to create them from scratch based on the specs. Let me now create both shared components.\n\nLet me review what each component needs based on the specs:\n\n**DocumentsSection** (shared between SupplierTracker and SalesCRM):\n- SupplierTracker uses it for:\n  - SupplierDetailsPage: Documents section (contracts, certifications, agreements) - name, type, upload date, view/download actions, search\n  - OrderDetailsPage: Documents section (purchase order PDFs, invoices, shipping documents) - file name, type, date, view/download actions\n\n\n- SalesCRM uses it for:\n  - ClientDetailPage: Attachments section - filename, type, created date, linked deal, download/view and delete options\n  - DealDetailPage: Attachments section - upload/download/delete actions\n\nBoth applications need a component that displays a list of documents with file name, type, and date, supporting upload, view, download, and delete actions along with search and filter capabilities, all with a configurable title.\n\n**TimelineSection** (shared between SupplierTracker and SalesCRM):\n- SupplierTracker uses it for OrderDetailsPage to show order history and activity logs with timestamps of order creation.\n- SalesCRM uses it for ClientDetailPage to display a consolidated chronological feed of tasks, contact events, status changes, deal stage changes, and notes.\n\nBoth need to show events in reverse chronological order with timestamps, descriptions, event type icons, and optional clickable entries. Now I'm ready to build out these components following the established patterns.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":273,"cache_read_input_tokens":52073,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":273,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9d3b6911-76ce-4102-bae2-7c6af177bf4f","uuid":"8e0df5f3-c2f9-4331-a096-114670409755"}
