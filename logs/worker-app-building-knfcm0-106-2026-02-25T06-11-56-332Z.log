Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root.

Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"848b854d-b682-4fa8-967e-7e49e19e13af","uuid":"7a9fc8ec-8535-44c6-b827-89eef274a2d1","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"848b854d-b682-4fa8-967e-7e49e19e13af","uuid":"4af5145f-eb2d-4e63-bb05-f5aef234f9c4","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-size: 14px;\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex / Value         |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —                   |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.05)` | ~5% warm black     |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(234, 231, 226)`     | `#eae7e2`          |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(242, 240, 236)`     | `#f2f0ec`          |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(230, 237, 232)`     | `#e6ede8`          |\n\nSelected row uses a very faint green tint to reinforce the accent color without being loud.\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: 4px;\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px 8px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(55, 52, 46);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background           | Description                  |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| Default | transparent          | No background                |\n| Hover   | rgb(235, 233, 228)   | `#ebe9e4` — warm subtle gray |\n| Active  | rgb(226, 224, 218)   | `#e2e0da` — slightly deeper  |\n\n### Active Nav Item (current page)\n\n```css\nbackground: rgb(226, 234, 229);  /* very faint green tint */\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#ddd9d3` — a warm gray rather than cool.\nHover border darkens to approximately `#c5c0b8`.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value | Usage                     |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| 4px   | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px   | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px   | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%   | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                    |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.15) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows use a warm-tinted black rather than pure black, keeping the overall palette cohesive.\n\n---\n\n## Transitions\n\n| Property         | Duration | Easing   | Usage                    |\n|------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|\n| background-color | 0.1s     | ease     | Fast hover interactions  |\n| opacity          | 0.2s     | ease-out | Standard fade-in/out     |\n| color            | 0.15s    | ease     | Text color shifts        |\n| fill             | 0.4s     | ease     | Icon color transitions   |\n\n---\n\n## CSS Custom Properties\n\n### Backgrounds & Colors\n`--bg-color`, `--bg-sidebar-color`, `--bg-base-color`, `--bg-border-color`, `--content-color-light`, `--content-highlight-color-light`\n\n### Interactive States\n`--normal-bg`, `--normal-border`, `--normal-border-hover`, `--normal-text`\n\n### Accent\n`--accent-primary: #4d7c5e`, `--accent-light: #5a8f6a`, `--accent-dark: #3e694e`, `--accent-muted: #6b8f7a`, `--accent-subtle-bg: #e6ede8`\n\n### Sizing\n`--sidebar-width` (240px), `--scrollbar-width` (12px), `--control-border-radius` (4px)\n\n---\n\n## Status Colors\n\nFor data-driven UIs that need status indicators (e.g., pipeline stages, priority levels):\n\n| Status     | Color     | Hex       | Notes                     |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Success    | Forest    | `#4d7c5e` | Matches primary accent    |\n| Warning    | Amber     | `#b08a3e` | Warm gold, not bright yellow |\n| Error      | Brick     | `#b05050` | Muted red, not alarming   |\n| Info       | Slate     | `#5a7a8a` | Cool blue-gray            |\n| Neutral    | Stone     | `#8a8580` | Warm gray                 |\n\nAll status colors are desaturated to fit the subdued palette. Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

I need to:\n\n1. First create the `reports` Netlify function (since it's referenced in the slice but doesn't exist)\n2. Write ReportHeader component\n3. Write VarianceSummary component\n4. Write VarianceChart component\n5. Write DetailedReportTable component\n6. Write ReportDetailsPage\n\nLet me start writing the components. I'll need to add CSS for the new components to index.css.\n\nLet me check if reports Netlify function needs to be created first - without it, the page won't work. The reportsSlice already has the thunks defined for fetching from `/.netlify/functions/reports`. \n\nLooking at the task more carefully, I see it's specifically asking for the five components and the page, not the Netlify function itself. The reportsSlice already has the fetch logic set up, so I can proceed with building the UI components that consume that data.\n\nNow let me map out what each component needs based on the test specifications. ReportHeader should display a breadcrumb navigation back to the reports list, the report name with its ID, and export buttons for both PDF and CSV formats. VarianceSummary will be a single card showing the key financial metrics—total variance with directional indicators, actual spend, budgeted spend, and a mini trend visualization all in one horizontal layout.\n\nVarianceChart displays a grouped bar chart comparing actual versus budgeted amounts by account, with red indicating overspend and green for underspend. DetailedReportTable is the main data view with expandable account rows, sub-items indented beneath them, variance amounts color-coded by performance, sparkline trends, and action buttons for each row.\n\nNow I'm ready to implement these components.

No charting library is installed, so I'll use pure SVG for the charts (bar chart and sparklines). This is perfectly fine for the use case.\n\nNow let me create the reports Netlify function and all the components. Let me start writing them all.\n\nFirst, let me create the reports Netlify function since it's critical for the page to work. Then I'll write each component.\n\nLet me plan the full code:\n\n**1. Netlify Function: `reports.ts`**\n- GET /reports → list all reports\n- GET /reports/:id → return report + items\n- POST /reports → create report (with report items generation)\n\n\n- DELETE /reports/:id → delete report\n\n**2. ReportHeader component:**\n- Breadcrumb using shared Breadcrumb component\n- Title with report name and ID\n- Export PDF and Export CSV buttons\n\n**3. VarianceSummary component:**\n- Summary card with Total Variance, Actual Spend, Budgeted Spend\n- Mini sparkline chart\n- Color coding for variance\n\n**4. VarianceChart component:**\n- SVG bar chart showing variance per account\n- Red bars above zero for over-budget\n- Green bars below zero for under-budget\n\n**5. DetailedReportTable component:**\n- Expandable/collapsable rows for drilling into details\n- Account rows and sub-item rows with color-coded variances\n- Sparklines in Trend column\n- View button for account rows\n\n**6. ReportDetailsPage:**\n- Uses NavBar, ReportHeader, VarianceSummary, VarianceChart, DetailedReportTable\n- Fetches report by ID\n- Displays loading/error states\n\nNow I'm organizing the data structure for report items with accounts as parent items and sub-items nested beneath them, then working through the variance calculation logic where positive values indicate under-budget and negative values indicate over-budget.\n\nChecking the existing ReportItem type to see how variance and variance_pct are already being computed... I'm verifying the variance calculation formula by checking it against the test data—budget minus actual gives me the right signs for both favorable and unfavorable variances. Now I need to confirm the ReportItem type and database schema match this calculation approach.\n\nLooking at what's already in the codebase, I see only an accounts function exists, so I'll need to create a new reports function. For the CSV export, I need to include columns for Account/Item, Actual, and the other required fields based on the test specifications.\n\nFor PDF export, since there's no PDF library available, I'll use the browser's print functionality with `window.print()` and style it appropriately so users can save it as a PDF from their print dialog.\n\nFor the CSV export, I can leverage the existing `generateCsv` utility.\n\nNow I need to handle the sparklines and mini trend charts—the VarianceSummary needs a small trend visualization on the right, and the DetailedReportTable needs sparklines in its Trend column. Since the report data doesn't include actual time-series information, I'll generate synthetic trend data based on the variance values and render them as simple SVG paths.\n\nWriting the component

Let me verify the CSS utility classes like `p-6` and `max-sm:p-3` are already defined in the existing stub rather than needing custom definitions. I need to verify whether those utility classes are already defined elsewhere in the codebase before deciding if my CSS additions are sufficient.","signature":"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
