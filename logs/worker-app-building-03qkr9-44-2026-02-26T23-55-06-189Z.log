You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me analyze what needs to be made responsive:\n\n1. **DashboardPage.tsx** - Already has `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the wrapper. The inline style filter bar uses `flexWrap: \"wrap\"` which is good. Looks mostly OK.\n\n2. **LowInventoryAlerts.tsx** - Has a table with column hiding already (`max-lg:hidden` on Severity, `max-md:hidden` on Reorder Point). The action buttons in each row use inline flex with gap. Need to make action buttons wrap on narrow screens, and possibly hide button text on small screens.\n\n\n3. **MaterialsCategoriesOverview.tsx** through **CategoryFilter.tsx** - The category cards already use responsive flex wrapping with `flex: \"1 1 200px\"`, and the filter components leverage the filter-bar class which handles wrapping. The RecentTransactionsTable also has appropriate column hiding for smaller viewports.\n\n4. **NewTransactionButton.tsx** - The button text needs attention on mobile devices.\n\nNow looking at what still needs work: the NewTransactionButton should hide its text label on small screens and show only the icon, while the LowInventoryAlerts component needs flex-wrap on its action buttons row and the button labels themselves might need to condense or wrap on narrow screens. The DashboardPage and MaterialsCategoriesOverview are already handling their responsive requirements well with existing padding and flex configurations. I'm realizing the button approach depends on whether they have icons—\"View Details\", \"Dismiss\", and \"Reorder\" don't have icons, so hiding text wouldn't work, but I should make sure they wrap properly with `flex-wrap` instead.\n\nLooking at the existing CSS, there's already responsive handling for the page header, data tables, and utility classes at different breakpoints. What I need to check is whether the DashboardPage filter row and other components are missing responsive adjustments—the inline `flexWrap` style is fine, but I should verify what else needs coverage.\n\nThe project uses custom CSS classes that mimic Tailwind conventions rather than actual Tailwind, so I'll need to work within that pattern. The main gaps appear to be hiding text labels on smaller screens while keeping icons, and ensuring flex containers wrap properly on narrow viewports.\n\nMy approach will be to wrap text elements with `max-sm:hidden` classes for the NewTransactionButton and action buttons, convert any remaining inline styles to utility classes for consistency, and adjust the MaterialsCategoriesOverview cards to stack responsively at smaller breakpoints. from full width. The flex: 1 1 200px already handles this since they'll wrap.\n\nLooking at what I've already covered, most of the responsive work is in place—the wrapper padding, page header, filter bar, and tables all have their responsive behavior sorted. The main gap I'm seeing is the NewTransactionButton that needs to be hidden on smaller screens, so let me focus on implementing that change along with converting the DashboardPage filter bar to use utility classes instead of inline

Let me check if it exists in the CSS. Looking at the CSS... no, it doesn't exist. But wait, the `style` attribute will override the `className` for the same property since inline styles have higher specificity. So `className=\"max-sm:gap-2\"` won't work because the inline `gap: 16` will take precedence.\n\nLet me reconsider the approach. I should either:\n1. Move all inline styles to CSS classes\n2. Or not try to override inline styles with CSS classes\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the filter bar, the inline styles already handle flex-wrap which is the important part. \n\nThe gap of 16px is actually fine across all screen sizes, so I should drop this change. Looking at the DashboardPage responsiveness more broadly, most of the key pieces are already in place—padding and headers scale appropriately, filters wrap correctly, tables hide columns on smaller screens, and the category cards flow naturally. The NewTransactionButton text is already hidden on mobile, and the action buttons in LowInventoryAlerts already wrap as needed.\n\nFor the MaterialsCategoriesOverview cards specifically, the `flex: \"1 1 200px\"` basis should work fine—on very narrow screens it'll naturally collapse to a single column since the 200px minimum will force the layout to stack. I'll revert the gap change since inline styles have higher specificity and won't be overridden anyway.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":271,"cache_read_input_tokens":58482,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":271,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"58cd703c-8d0d-4138-b248-e0d501d37743","uuid":"ce26f92d-d5be-4f0d-a801-ac4627a4ac71"}

Let me look at the full picture:\n\nThe DashboardPage has:\n1. Page wrapper with `p-6 max-sm:p-3` ✓\n2. Page header with `.page-header` / `.page-title` / `.page-header-actions` - already responsive via CSS ✓\n3. Filter row with inline flex-wrap ✓\n4. LowInventoryAlerts - table with column hiding, action buttons now with flex-wrap ✓\n5. MaterialsCategoriesOverview - flex-wrap cards ✓\n\n\n6. RecentTransactionsTable - table with column hiding ✓\n7. NewTransactionButton - label now hidden on small screens, icon stays ✓\n\nThe 480px card mode in index.css handles the data-table on very narrow screens. I've covered typography scaling with the page-title and section-card-title already handled by CSS, button text hiding for narrow viewports is done on the NewTransactionButton, and horizontal button rows are using flex-wrap throughout.\n\nNow I'm checking the MaterialsCategoriesOverview cards - they're using inline styles with 16px padding which should be acceptable on small screens, and the filter components have proper flex-wrapping set up. I need to look more closely at what happens on screens narrower than 480px to see if there are any remaining issues. Reviewing the responsive CSS for the data table at 480px breakpoint to ensure the card layout handles the action buttons cell properly with the flex-wrap behavior already in place.\n\nThe columns hidden at larger breakpoints via `max-lg:hidden` and `max-md:hidden` will remain hidden at 480px since they have `!important`, which is fine for very narrow screens.
