Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise.

There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":144,"startLine":1,"totalLines":144}}}

Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":133,"startLine":1,"totalLines":133}}}

The DealDetailPage is fully specified in `tests.md` (lines 357-713) with comprehensive test entries for all its components:\n\n1. DealHeader\n2. StageProgressBar\n3. DealHistorySection\n4. DealMetricsSection\n5. WriteupsSection\n6. LinkedTasksSection\n7. DealAttachmentsSection\n8. DealContactsSection\n\nBut the page, its components, backend functions, Redux store slice, and tests are ALL completely absent from the codebase.\n\nNow let me systematically check for violations.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecDealDetailPage\n\n\nI'm going through each test entry in tests.md for the DealDetailPage and verifying it against the testSpec.md requirements—making sure I've inventoried every visible element from the mockup, avoided substituting easier implementations for what's actually specified, and maintained consistent styling and navigation across the page.\n\nNow I'm examining the DealHeader section to check that all its components are properly tested, including the deal title display and any other interactive or visual elements that need coverage. - Editable fields verify persistence ✓\n- Deal title updates when client or value changes ✓\n- Change Stage button appearance is tested with the blue styling ✓\n\nNow looking at the StageProgressBar component, I'm verifying it displays all six stages in the correct order, marks completed stages with blue checkmarks, shows the current stage with a label, greys out future stages, and updates properly when the stage changes ✓\n\nThe DealHistorySection tests look solid too - it displays the heading, shows stage changes chronologically, prevents duplicate entries when the stage updates, and handles the empty state ✓\n\nFor DealMetricsSection, I'm checking that the heading appears, the probability percentage displays, the expected close date shows, and both fields are editable ✓\n\nMoving into WriteupsSection now - the heading and New Entry button render, existing entries display, and each entry has an Edit button available.\n\nLooking at the Version History button test, it verifies that clicking opens the previous versions, but I'm noticing it doesn't actually test closing or navigating away from that modal. Directive 7 requires completely testing modal dialogs - so I should check if the Version History modal needs a close/cancel test to be thorough. The creation and edit forms both test open, submit/save, and cancel flows, but the Version History modal only tests the open action. That's a gap I should address.\n\nMoving on to the LinkedTasksSection, I've covered all the core functionality - the heading and Add Task button display, the task list with checkboxes, marking tasks complete with persistence and cross-page sync, unchecking completed tasks, opening the form, creating new tasks with sync, validating required fields, and cancelling the form. The state-changing actions directive is satisfied since the task completion test verifies the side effect on the client's Tasks section, and the new task test confirms cross-page synchronization.\n\nFor DealAttachmentsSection, the tests cover displaying the heading and upload button, showing the file list with details, opening the file upload dialog, adding new attachments with cross-page sync to the client's Attachments section, downloading files, deleting with confirmation and cross-page sync, and the empty state. Directive 8 about file upload support is met - the test confirms users can select files from their device.\n\nNow looking at DealContactsSection, I'm checking that the heading displays, person entries show with their details, and I need to see what other contact-related tests are being covered. View Profile link navigates for Jane Smith ✓\n- Test: View Profile link navigates for Bob Johnson ✓\n- Test: shows empty state ✓\n- Test: Add contact to deal ✓\n- Test: Remove contact from deal ✓ (with confirmation)\n\nDirective 4 (navigation targets): View Profile specifies navigation to Person Detail Page with URL ✓\nDirective 11 (reciprocal relationships): Add contact test verifies the deal is reflected in the individual's associated deals ✓. Remove contact verifies the deal is no longer in Bob Johnson's associated deals ✓.\n\nNow checking against the directives for gaps. All 8 components have test coverage ✓. The WriteupVersion History button only tests opening but not closing, which could be a gap in modal dialog testing. Most creation and edit dialogs have comprehensive open, submit, validate, and cancel tests ✓. For data mutations with side effects, I'm seeing stage changes create history entries with exact assertions, task check/uncheck and creation update the client tasks section, attachments are tested for upload and delete, and adding contacts to deals is covered.\n\nThe Deal History section appears to only track stage changes based on its description, not all field edits, which seems reasonable. Writeup edits do create version history entries as tested ✓. Now I need to verify that every clickable element has its exact navigation target or action result specified.\n\nLooking more closely at the DealContactsSection tests, I notice the \"Add Contact\" dialog test only covers the success path—there's no test for cancelling it, which violates the modal dialog testing directive. The \"Remove contact\" confirmation dialog does test both confirm and cancel paths ✓. For the DealAttachmentsSection, the file upload dialog is native so cancellation might not need testing, but the file upload success path test seems incomplete. I'm checking the DealAttachmentsSection file upload tests against the directives, and they do cover the required functionality. Looking at DealHeader, the \"Change Stage\" button test properly documents the blue styling. For DealContactsSection, the test entries verify all the required display elements—avatar, bold name, role and client in parentheses, and the View Profile link. The main gap I'm identifying for Job 1 is the missing cancel test for the Add Contact dialog.\n\nI'm also reconsidering whether the DealDetailPage needs its own sidebar tests. The sidebar tests appear only under ClientsListPage, but that might be intentional since they're testing the shared Sidebar component rather than page-specific behavior. This doesn't necessarily violate the directives unless each page is explicitly required to re-test the sidebar independently.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the DealDetailPage component structure to see what's actually being tested—it includes the DealHeader with various fields and controls, a StageProgressBar showing the deal pipeline stages, a DealHistorySection tracking stage changes chronologically, metrics for probability and close date, a WriteupsSection for managing entries with edit and version history options, and a LinkedTasksSection with task checkboxes and names.\n\nLooking at the remaining sections, there's also a DealAttachmentsSection for file management with download and delete capabilities, and a DealContactsSection displaying team members with their roles and profiles. The test coverage appears fairly comprehensive across all these components, though there's a gap around the Add Contact dialog's cancel functionality.\n\nSince there are no actual DealDetailPage components in the codebase despite the detailed test specifications, this represents a significant deviation from the writeApp.md requirements. The directives focus on implementation standards rather than whether components exist, so I need to evaluate this discrepancy carefully. I'm realizing the core issue: Jobs 2 and 3 are asking me to check code that doesn't exist, so there's nothing to validate against the directives. The absence of the DealDetailPage components and tests themselves isn't a violation of the directives—it's just that there's no code to check.\n\nFor Job 1, I found one violation: the tests.md spec describes an Add Contact dialog flow but doesn't include a test case for canceling that dialog. Let me verify this is actually a gap by reviewing the full test specification again. I'm noticing the file upload dialog is a native browser element so cancellation isn't something we'd test there, but I should verify whether the attachment section covers all required elements—the component lists filename, size, Download and Delete links, plus an upload button, which all appear to be tested against the directive to inventory visible elements.\n\nNow looking at DealContactsSection, the component description only mentions person entries with avatar, name, role, client, and View Profile link, but the tests include Add Contact and Remove actions that aren't explicitly listed in the description—though the directives do allow for adding necessary features like create and delete buttons beyond the spec.\n\nThe real issue I need to focus on is the missing cancel test for the Add Contact dialog. I should also verify that DealAttachmentsSection's file upload tests cover the necessary scenarios, and check whether the import/upload dialogs specify expected data formats as required by the directives. , looking at how other similar sections describe their components, they consistently mention action buttons like \"Add Task\" or \"New Entry\" in their descriptions. DealContactsSection is missing that—it doesn't list the Add Contact or Remove buttons even though they're tested, which suggests the component description isn't fully capturing all visible interactive
