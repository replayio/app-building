If so, add a note on the entry in\nbugReports.md but make no other changes.\n\nIf there is no directive against the bad behavior, add one or update any similar / conflicting directive.\nAdd a note on the entry in bugReports.md about the update made.\n\nDirectives should be general purpose and not include details or examples specific to the app being built.\n\n## Finishing bugs\n\nUpdate `docs/bugReports.md` to move the report from the \"Unreviewed\" section to the \"Finished\" section,\ncreating it at the end if necessary.\n\nMove the report from \"Unreviewed\" to \"Finished\" in `docs/bugReports.md`.\n","numLines":73,"startLine":1,"totalLines":73}}}

They only modified log files and task files, meaning there were no bugs to fix/review at those times.\n\nThe latest \"Unpack: Fix open bug reports\" (1c71490) also only changed log and task files.\n\n\nNow I'm understanding the workflow better—bugs get reported, analyzed in individual files, fixed in the code, and then moved to the bugReports.md file once they're resolved.\n\nSince that file doesn't exist yet, I should check the git history of the bug files to see which ones have actually been fixed and determine if they should have been added to bugReports.md already.","signature":"EuIRCkYICxgCKkAf+sd2ApCPoZIpMtIFv/M5pEuuCwMcCBj4puOl7Hh3O5I18QIFtn/pWxAxOFzHXRIa00NbfYEKrE9SUAxHUulvEgwEE1X8HJAJx48lY8waDNI0NBO4PJK35XKBYiIw+73Y8eXH1jYce7lzvcthyDQYKyRZU21jmdCzJfQ6bx1NlY2SX5nO3ilYNKPmDEtAKskQ/VatRDhGayjX/JDEptHSiMLDkJz3MwzbVM25z429bw9is3dI9XAacjXH2gslvHWPuQj/FHMg5diBWlBapV9YJS7YYNyTWAfifO85lzWF30G4YkedUvNYBKTPJAwwDvxu6o1Woz8A33dwxn81fQ/P2bwAnsfy5HpsQ3DMR75icvyzQ4T0KzgS88myNHHgQ0xEjKuZH2WSMR9fdg121ndYvvOph1kLJjDK2X1g3DjphWjbVJvmf15rpFjh04eV5iFSpgOQTA8CynB9djoAAMemp7SNvIRbalLNFxPdtNl+AcQJ3w/T/4zF6p0Sb3p/fqDWIROXaTfc0GBcYkBY3XHOO8gz7jqFd8hGISF8Q4p2BGwGrwsOiraPNryRr3VDtT5MWjbTcwDnxle1ur7XAERuNiCGAptlceNz3ej/DDulPVtFBQzFdwK7tJKKaJ11JXWgtX/so9X6gdtFJo/2IxuHrcK77zqD/zuAp8b485EY2nUZfktaFpJkq+GxOBLT2zp9SO98h+VQdnyMlzlvSF9kWT9RzknhXijlY2DQdqMZhYFR015B7dm7PHCykUT9wklQoTDKHyVMa7c/Y3XMm3htVSMhbXxVehtcFA9blJFgOFpj/Yv1Y/By/wC4FVQpx1w4f5Ow/Cn7GPv6iFnl+uAke+w7hHbljyjYoNqC+k3IYjZJaRj7nnNKsBT3iEg05sip8731RGkxTmSwDSEQcPay3F3R7dVmNmO+ubvPJ+7vNfTsq0ofd34f8c9YXqtxPHPPKLaNbOAGZPkjmhqJz1V9weHwyphDIs6Fhae7mXazdTQWJ1/3ke+kM94xbHKsNSyw6/tfA9MvM+UFqo6kFQu8VxdHnP4MkP2nyXK4T705A/DDTLeVrzwMHATJTFbgLY4PcEfomgz0y6BI2zi5pk0ZBoXh7lsmNGZ83RiykMjNSelM0bVWzWEXv6FSBn1wJVWDEXOH+HkdSuZAsTF6cl/6YYgjxILeSewCInWLK/ESRmqOXyZ0Fxa1zWrYmdbAIWLvBLsJ9HTXqtI4McMQjqhHiw/bcOuz/N4nz5+FB4jwOX2mXqG+FLzoqz5NYgsk75A6xz6LRzgCRRuNPmIH9HjCNgA/lT2gXBJYknRR08/5amap8rkjnxcFY+K8WXtqV0PIw6BEiuQmG7uYXCycmU0AgqueEMgb5WmU21T1M9ICCk8Olzv4SB5n3wYGlbbYwfJGjpakXkE3uB4I61Je7AYOy3dMjYNgb7vN42l9kXhG6dMYcQL50tCvJyLhK28We/xzOFIPGM5KxLxNGJUHAsykIY+abIYEyIBhpSG/UTJjrnZbpSF2+Biu+4HGokJC/hOCzKxdHq9XTJpYSW+hudrmhfjy99SuasQQIxgWfyQrgObS6fCJZCWNKZ1wzZbyvq9Cza7MP/BR9o5tmclUX2yRtHelKsOyHo5RqMNwxJEqXofvEBcN8n+HD8ZllP0fMq1uf9mlVBlDS66p2m5oYhJycHvU8s7zkVCi5lvOX5cXuh7AGvnldG49twUVkCfmm113i9R1h7jOppFUb2jRJ4JrrHBM6ou8JM8OfA8EK7CQbvjfctFCY648BU8TJzXIkm92R9FDyOVNLO6jk3AknzhLqvOLZWXpj1H+DTaua+hpk9vwrdWnbd354GNh8x4jJUcDNEQRcro/PW8AZo7szOQMl28A9y5lxR1LykgDY8x4eLTMgUq2H2/SrpbIQwF0k8ZjjaqeL/3okGL2CSvqVEDJYdgRVrrNimMxKAxxnOhP9vrP/SBSt+dPUE04g41hcvxgMaDNpsbqjulL9vBDAn77Id/m7hp8UERdcaXcgmQbDY8QHRYIPg/Fj+UIms0iRB5dQ1ncFfmt9+3JXFHBovTOJirIZa9Ltv1GzrS+mTKor8f+Xw3WqdCOXN5wuWQv/6PnmuiEYjs+kTC4F4QLGxJd7lvWJp8y08KMa3SVaWz6fGqkvtenfjd9Nr03rq3tmyors5EGigmFcKOB0X2ejodTVvuEHM3upjc4Dy5i2zUjokjtEtMj+Ue2jXvJGS4EdzwW8G0Ko4IinevABJqfu/aFp4T7dMfQouW2Q9zQzM4hVVCoQs5XnrlTzJ5UgHZZviyUXc7blBxF5oJxMSsxRJNRe6tdPY7ffQdkacNbgx5TqCzR0gj7AW16r3HHjbsg+3NYl7DYG0utYccDoksj26taCcyDPFPvGCAkx9C5N1Qkg0RXbF5NCF+4SCHDYeJfNkuVg3xTEhGpekA0PWSKV2ToXbhI983/By7UbRJMjhwuR1ESK046lYSW+tvacsufarY2w0xal7K6gzyqr04ew2CBuimG0GQzCXiMBDNykJ5IYMY3NWtWm5fbMnShw8LG3bGU4heldNftPi8IweX1bNOBfPFXa/ggg9fxEx0mAMCbF1cxoTPoAICmQy2WrVYbxM1iiYEAfCIK0dV7ui6+ZKTtMbTRCaxUfZd3t92HKNgnhbuAvJFcGqey6mY4O5ngvZ9nBTItvLdt4+hjB0EMVb4jszg5lBf/D+3caDuhQuXrzqwLJQwPeqWzhSlSyzHcC7YC1Uy1G6hYenp8NCKUGGEakMgs7ZL1i3iwbXc5h0W7h6BruBNUlkZn6qX0pgC/Nt82jjUBFbioEafebVO/9LJTsqM22ViVG1WBagkGQylh4ipga47g83qlZ0gGgpQqTz0Kvco1N9vkG5lV2WBTg7CqIQkEVyQ/B3zst5kqz0IX3hfi8z0YJ5xQ+4gm8Pevmh7mhG1chP12yU2zX/1P8x2RBTzzNbXKQ4FYVPY2pWg27FRQAALZ3iDDJDsoJo0wX3fkFkLEvIY6octFGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1228,"cache_read_input_tokens":37904,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1228,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1b720de9-9c7a-463f-b08e-f0dcb124231b","uuid":"647b3cee-9727-448e-9a14-07efdcaed6ae"}

Let me check what apps had bugReports.md and what the current state is. Let me check if there's a `bugReports.md` in any of the current app directories.\n\nActually wait - I already checked and there's no bugReports.md anywhere. It was in git history but got removed. So I need to check what bugs exist that might be \"unreviewed\".\n\nLet me think about this differently. The current state is:\n1. Bug report files exist in `apps/*/docs/bugs/`  \n\n\n2. No `bugReports.md` file exists currently\n3. The recent \"Fix open bug reports\" and \"Review fixed bug reports\" tasks completed without creating this file, which suggests there were no bugs to process at those times\n\nSince those tasks ran without generating bugReports.md, the bugs must have already been addressed in earlier commits. Let me look at the SalesCRM AppRevisions.md to see what's there.\n\nI should also check whether any new bugs were introduced between the last review at ebffb5c and the current commit at 1c71490. Looking at the commits in that range, they're mostly ProductionHub directive violations and their fixes.

This should be added as a directive in writeApp.md.\n- Before: 1352882\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added `p-6 max-sm:p-3` padding to ForgotPasswordPage, ResetPasswordPage, ConfirmEmailPage, and NotFoundPage root elements. These pages were missing the consistent padding that all other pages (ClientsListPage, DealsListPage, etc.) already had. Added directive to writeApp.md requiring all pages to include consistent padding on their root element. Added SPACING-01 cross-cutting test to verify pages have non-zero padding.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — no directive required page-level padding, so auth pages and the 404 page were created without it\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: every page component must include consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`) on its root element\n\n2/23/2026: Email confirmation for password login does not work in production — confirmation emails contain localhost URLs (from getAppUrl() in netlify/utils/email.ts defaulting to http://localhost:8888 when process.env.URL is not set), so users can never confirm their email and are blocked from logging in. Tests did not catch this because IS_TEST mode bypasses email confirmation entirely (auto-confirms on signup, skips the check on login), so the actual production email confirmation flow is never exercised. Directive added to writeTests.md: auth flows with email verification must have dedicated tests that run without IS_TEST bypass.\n- Before: 084ad68\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Changed `getAppUrl()` in `netlify/utils/email.ts` and `netlify/utils/notifications.ts` to accept the full `Request` object instead of just the URL string. The function now reads `x-forwarded-host` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers (set by Netlify's CDN proxy) to determine the correct production origin, falling back to the `host` header, then `req.url` origin, then `process.env.URL`, then localhost. Updated all callers in auth.ts, deals.ts, clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-people.ts, client-deals.ts to pass `req` instead of `req.url`. Added two new tests (AUTH-CE-03, AUTH-RP-04) that exercise the email confirmation and password reset flows without IS_TEST bypass by inserting test data directly into the database and calling the API endpoints.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — `getAppUrl()` only tried parsing `req.url` as a full URL (which in Netlify Functions may be a local address) and fell back to `process.env.URL` then hardcoded localhost, instead of reading proxy headers that carry the real production host\n\n2/21/2026: Adding a relationship to a contact does not update the other contact to show the reciprocal relationship.\n- Before: 9441d18\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated the GET /individuals/:id endpoint to query relationships in both directions using UNION ALL. Forward relationships (where the individual is the source) are returned as-is. Reverse relationships (where the individual is the target) are included with inverted relationship types (manager↔report; symmetric types like colleague, decision_maker, influencer, other stay the same). Updated DELETE to allow removing a relationship from either side. No schema changes needed — the fix is purely in the query layer.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — the backend only queried individual_relationships in one direction (WHERE individual_id = :id), ignoring rows where the individual appeared as related_individual_id\n\n## Finished\n\n2/19/2026: WebhookDialogInstructions — The \"Add Webhook\" dialog needs actual setup instructions for each supported platform.\n- Before: 25bd361\n- After: 7af02ba\n- Fix: Added platform-specific setup guide to the WebhookModal with Zapier, n8n, and Custom Endpoint tabs. Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Webhook Setup Guides section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: e4b5f26\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n\n2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: 837fc7f\n- After: 366203c\n- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n\n2/20/2026: Directive violations — TLP-NAV-01/02 missing Contacts, PageHeader descriptions missing Import button\n- Before: 2cc96fc\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Fixed TLP-NAV-01 and TLP-NAV-02 test entries in docs/tests.md to include \"Contacts\" in the sidebar navigation links (matching CLP-NAV-01/02 which already had it). Updated PageHeader component descriptions for TasksListPage and DealsListPage to mention the Import button (which existed in code and had test entries but was missing from the Components section). Updated Playwright tests for TLP-NAV-01 (added Contacts visibility check) and TLP-NAV-02 (added Contacts navigation check). All 23 tasks-list-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the Contacts nav item and Import buttons were omitted from TLP-NAV-01/02 entries and PageHeader component descriptions when those sections were originally written\n\n2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n- Before: edc5279\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1b720de9-9c7a-463f-b08e-f0dcb124231b","uuid":"724dda29-d6a1-4d4e-b57c-dda1c57e1cf5","tool_use_result":{"stdout":"# Bug Reports\n\n## Open\n\n## Unreviewed\n\n2/23/2026: The forgot password screen and other pages have content flush against the top/sides of the screen with no breathing room — pages need consistent padding/margin so content is not pressed against screen edges. This should be added as a directive in writeApp.md.\n- Before: 1352882\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added `p-6 max-sm:p-3` padding to ForgotPasswordPage, ResetPasswordPage, ConfirmEmailPage, and NotFoundPage root elements. These pages were missing the consistent padding that all other pages (ClientsListPage, DealsListPage, etc.) already had. Added directive to writeApp.md requiring all pages to include consistent padding on their root element. Added SPACING-01 cross-cutting test to verify pages have non-zero padding.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — no directive required page-level padding, so auth pages and the 404 page were created without it\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: every page component must include consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`) on its root element\n\n2/23/2026: Email confirmation for password login does not work in production — confirmation emails contain localhost URLs (from getAppUrl() in netlify/utils/email.ts defaulting to http://localhost:8888 when process.env.URL is not set), so users can never confirm their email and are blocked from logging in. Tests did not catch this because IS_TEST mode bypasses email confirmation entirely (auto-confirms on signup, skips the check on login), so the actual production email confirmation flow is never exercised. Directive added to writeTests.md: auth flows with email verification must have dedicated tests that run without IS_TEST bypass.\n- Before: 084ad68\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Changed `getAppUrl()` in `netlify/utils/email.ts` and `netlify/utils/notifications.ts` to accept the full `Request` object instead of just the URL string. The function now reads `x-forwarded-host` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers (set by Netlify's CDN proxy) to determine the correct production origin, falling back to the `host` header, then `req.url` origin, then `process.env.URL`, then localhost. Updated all callers in auth.ts, deals.ts, clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-people.ts, client-deals.ts to pass `req` instead of `req.url`. Added two new tests (AUTH-CE-03, AUTH-RP-04) that exercise the email confirmation and password reset flows without IS_TEST bypass by inserting test data directly into the database and calling the API endpoints.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — `getAppUrl()` only tried parsing `req.url` as a full URL (which in Netlify Functions may be a local address) and fell back to `process.env.URL` then hardcoded localhost, instead of reading proxy headers that carry the real production host\n\n2/21/2026: Adding a relationship to a contact does not update the other contact to show the reciprocal relationship.\n- Before: 9441d18\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated the GET /individuals/:id endpoint to query relationships in both directions using UNION ALL. Forward relationships (where the individual is the source) are returned as-is. Reverse relationships (where the individual is the target) are included with inverted relationship types (manager↔report; symmetric types like colleague, decision_maker, influencer, other stay the same). Updated DELETE to allow removing a relationship from either side. No schema changes needed — the fix is purely in the query layer.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — the backend only queried individual_relationships in one direction (WHERE individual_id = :id), ignoring rows where the individual appeared as related_individual_id\n\n## Finished\n\n2/19/2026: WebhookDialogInstructions — The \"Add Webhook\" dialog needs actual setup instructions for each supported platform.\n- Before: 25bd361\n- After: 7af02ba\n- Fix: Added platform-specific setup guide to the WebhookModal with Zapier, n8n, and Custom Endpoint tabs. Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Webhook Setup Guides section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: e4b5f26\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API.

It had sections: Open, Unreviewed, and Finished. The file was removed in commit 8fa6093 (\"Remove apps/ and logs/ before merging to main\").\n\nNow, in the current codebase, there are bug files in `apps/*/docs/bugs/` that contain analysis. The question is: are any of these bugs \"unreviewed\"?\n\nThe bug files in the current repo were created in commits:\n- Accounting bugs: `be269ab` and `d526fea`\n- InventoryTracker bugs: `69efea7`\n\n\n- ProductionHub bugs: `93f3352`\n- SalesCRM bugs: `6581e2e`\n\nAll of these were created well before the `8fa6093` merge commit that removed the old bugReports.md. Since that file was removed and never recreated, these bugs in the new apps have never been tracked in a bugReports.md file. Technically, there are no unreviewed bugs to report since the tracking file doesn't exist, but the intent of the task suggests I should consider whether these bugs themselves are unreviewed.\n\nThese bug reports exist in the docs/bugs/ directories and have been fixed, but they haven't gone through the review process—no classification, directive updates, or completion marking.

But the previous review didn't do anything because there was no bugReports.md file.\n\nLet me also check the first \"Unpack: Fix open bug reports\" (37bfd6c) and the most recent one (1c71490). The \"Fix open bug reports\" task is supposed to fix bugs, and then the \"Review fixed bug reports\" task is supposed to review them.\n\nWait, I need to look at this differently. The bug files exist in `docs/bugs/` directories. These bugs were fixed in code already (the code changes were committed). \n\nThe workflow requires a `bugReports.md` file with an Unreviewed section to track fixed bugs, but this file doesn't exist, which explains why the previous review found nothing. Looking at the recent \"Unpack: Fix open bug reports\" task, it only modified logs and task files without actually fixing any new bugs or creating the necessary tracking file.\n\nSince there's no `bugReports.md` file with unreviewed bug reports, my current task to review fixed bug reports has nothing to process, so I should just signal completion. But let me double-check whether there's something I'm missing about how bugs are supposed to be tracked here. the bugs are stored as individual files in `docs/bugs/` across the new apps, but there's no `bugReports.md` file tracking them. These look like internal analysis files from the development process rather than user-submitted bug reports that would go through the review workflow. The skill's requirement is clear—if bugReports.md doesn't exist, there are no unreviewed bug reports to process, so the task is complete. But I'm wondering if each app should have its own bugReports.md file, or if there's a structural issue I'm missing about how bugs are supposed to be tracked across the
