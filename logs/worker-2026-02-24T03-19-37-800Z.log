I need to add missing test entries for all DealsListPage components in docs/tests.md. The components listed are:\n- DealsSummaryCards\n- DealsViewTabs\n- DealsFilters\n- DealsTable\n- CreateDealButton\n- Pagination\n\nCurrently, the DealsListPage section in tests.md (lines 343-353) only has the Components list and a comment saying \"Test entries will be added by PlanComponent jobs\". I need to add detailed test entries for each of these components following the testSpec.md directives and the deals-list mockup.\n\nLet me study the mockup carefully:\n\n\nLooking at the mockup, I can see the DealsSummaryCards display four key metrics at the top (Total Active Deals: 124, Pipeline Value: $4.5M, Won and Lost counts for Q3), the DealsViewTabs toggle between Table View and Pipeline View, and the DealsFilters section provides dropdowns for Stage, Client, and Status filtering options.\n\nThe DealsTable shows columns for Deal Name, Client, Stage, Owner, Value, Close Date with sorting capability, and Status with color-coded badges (On Track, Needs Attention, At Risk, Won), plus a row action menu. There's a blue \"Create New Deal\" button in the top right and pagination showing \"Page 1 of 9\" at the bottom. I need to write test entries for each visible element, making sure to specify what happens when each clickable element is interacted with, rather than substituting simpler alternatives.\n\nLooking at the existing test patterns in tests.md for ClientsListPage to maintain consistency, I'm noting the status badge colors and the deal stages visible in the mockup—Proposal Sent, Qualification, Negotiation, Discovery, and Closed Won. Now I'll structure comprehensive test entries following the same format, covering every component and ensuring that state-changing actions verify updates across related parts of the interface. Looking at the Components section, I can see the key elements I need to test: the summary cards showing deal metrics, the view tabs for switching between table and pipeline layouts, the filter controls with their various dropdowns and search, the table itself with its columns and actions, plus pagination and the create button. Let me cross-reference this with the app spec to understand the expected behavior and interactions for each component.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":19328,"cache_read_input_tokens":26268,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":19328,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a765e667-21c1-4521-b597-f1d54ef1576c"
