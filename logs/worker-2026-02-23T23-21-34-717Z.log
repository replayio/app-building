This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.

The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n    62→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n    63→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→\n    65→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n    66→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n    67→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n    68→\n    69→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n    70→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n    71→\n    72→## Tips\n    73→\n    74→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n    75→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n    76→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n    77→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n    78→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n    79→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n    80→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n    81→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n    82→  tests. Consider adding database re-seeding in `globalSetup` or `beforeAll`, or make tests that\n    83→  create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated records.\n    84→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n    85→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n    86→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n    87→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n    88→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n    89→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n    90→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n    91→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n    92→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n    93→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n    94→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n    95→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n    96→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n    97→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019N93oy2EH6Kn9Hhv6K9fxD","session_id":"70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e","uuid":"f1ac2d20-cd3f-4eba-b7be-08eaa1dbb831"}

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    20→\n    21→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    22→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    23→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    24→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    25→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    26→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    27→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    28→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    29→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    30→\n    31→## Directives\n    32→\n    33→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    34→\n    35→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    36→\n    37→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    38→\n    39→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    40→\n    41→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    42→\n    43→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    44→\n    45→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    46→\n    47→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    48→\n    49→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    50→\n    51→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    52→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    53→\n    54→## Tips\n    55→\n    56→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    57→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    58→- When starting from scratch with no existing plan.md, create and commit plan.md before moving on\n    59→  to PlanPage tasks. This avoids losing the plan if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    60→- The PlanPages task must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    61→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    62→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    63→  plan.md, commit, and exit. A zero-commit iteration is always a failure — prioritize writing\n    64→  output over exhaustive exploration.\n    65→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

timeout on evaluate\n6. \"Sidebar is persistent across all pages\" - `tasks-list-page` not found at `/tasks`\n\nInterestingly, the Tasks, Team, and Settings navigation tests all passed, along with the active link update on sub-routes, which suggests the routing mechanism itself is working but there's something inconsistent about how the sidebar elements are being rendered or identified across different pages.\n\nLooking at the actual error patterns more closely, it seems like the navigation is reaching the right pages—the Clients page loads successfully in test 3, for instance—but then the subsequent element lookups are failing, which points to either timing issues with the DOM updates or the selectors not matching what's actually rendered.","signature":"EtgTCkYICxgCKkBBFeSyP/KlIiJZZRzpB4B3Vhg+zQMo7T2/0YMjj5JDnaZhdaB6qReyXNnp9onxTduTWhrAtxUpX+sCpLSa6Z4ZEgxeDuHD06inEMbyZ14aDLkZ/KyH5Eqs/yWrliIwyg1qKdovPsqCh/vn5kSBGH9cceGd37GrBjLHnjtAorOfU4iBTxSrEd7gkegSTaq1Kr8Ss/ApVnrSyGedhweAsfNHK56JxqyNoJE4AaUf4N2PqJoSZ4uMNQoG+H0zeJvuFAAIBBnPUJ7JNv5ZYrGvkVWcRYPsp76LGGH+2v2eTyicCRabdUq7HBHv9WV1oNrcIaUYwgTsea9rbL5nLL7E6TF/xfvPEan9HCRDiOzgMDbadB/knRqYN/DwYnNApeRsDBUAxkiXr4gk2bsM3DED+LbYReOltBhEukqcNM3nMw0SrIfgLBUGqOQWex6hbxQVHS87632WdtQLlpBQ9ABVCs8uZjCJ+PjmEOLrbmf6uuvu/921Xzmte43YtekRE51wjurJZ80UiOp1tTZU61/Gte5I1l5jbYPd3Ydk2AHXBxuXbK90CXa9aNPFEqVSzfbZ2Ht4B2L367S9//wOKwgun/0tunSuq80yQ5Vwmnk7riz9utmSg8QMXQeIZi/cvEao1Dym9xP6ElsTM4EVgcTGnCZ3t9hAwszStrAcfRvnfd59M5xgsoHc4r24OraWPWbyIY/1khWmljg6mYhairL6dCz2Kp5f9mrJYoSwfZCV47k6Rfz13wBTPU+o0JuUbsASaA3Zbt5+YiPupLsYLHo1SXDVGYCbZmfIXJVNjdFolAQ8sMbCDFd8d1Hngp1vzs3+7dL9uDIuRPIcSyQ3+n1INl+7vYWBCZ3WTh5JAe3rc3a5YLkkLi4mU77dcBhsIhm2iXcYx9xQW04xCRWZWYtPF1U6NCdQK4T6ZtcRXUOIvVNxqYJcWoPAcz18JF/At7Bvbi4W8/WWvvF7xWG5SiGF17Kt81V7Fjig8q94akw9Zh4hwAoEuC+hTAF9oTbY9KnJDh3m1i0/f2CoOu7FBc01Gm0xjq0xZW64wfPovFg8G94RAvGkAxIVXTeIVP16vYIB7wV29Pp0hQDIQryGNXhyPwWYTyLJznsAVDTPpDL8059EVn3HN2TWNbs2LTmKYaKjcZE/2H5sWIy3L3zYFRe9T+cIq6k9L7s7Eb6sZFOfzfjmnXNwbRbdLxYq2z7KP5AGM97CTKWfScHkXqtcJmCu4outcXP4h3ZckmIK+3U45VEqyuX8Wcf1G8I6T7OX95lDp5A4J1wqQIeg1tbV0lpUuktMpa3o8UNPeU5rAfN521ThSr5/QW+7748Uj0n/Y1BY3VQ8miVlhl50MTyK7OTO4UNeuJcfljCKQoaci47CaJaDD8ufnAkYpjiYdr8yeI1OEokTcM4T1p0LCMSbFY0r0AkeDimA1OaZ+fFO4d7O86T7q3gr+53lgwSxK2CiC61wS3IO1ZBC1nEHpfcCayJ8x/3LWc9jRH9YMNCRzJN1KFjWDqDZ7rGzltSi+MJxL4Dvfqmv+pacJANEgJgTnCzZ67vYAMECiMFbL9JEke1THs6ZoevvcTs79jpApmbO2yEPmJidqO0UjdFjrPLPuXFacgkBN6NZHC+Z5QuQFZDLUs+d2o39LuCOoCoZkcxPO3zlF1XyEyEiFDUiwiv4HLGcmib3wAMvcaQB1DZlALS67t6ZQwvjUcUs0TPIESEl13fiR1EssrJj2dxI31lOq2lyJzyH/QWUgzvVaKKVhS2/1sfs0+dVeYxZ66BGyXGc4jPGBq7f8SDnDdK/MM9yYdlfPXI24HhlQBOWDGriRgnb3EjE6tEn5jy6IIlrLTMgBdmPvndCdw1nIufHryc4DEMAI5BkLkehqOJqTd1mWmFsVOZ0jp8aVsoHKHhrf3zfPXjGfwnycCAxP6vepmxVbLA7YxEymw6T3LXMKGhdbL2yq5poECn69R8cpCo7iJa9K26HGm6kXOMdLNLwe9p7uShLiNAv71sDKBZ9iMG0nWod0Na7JU42Sl51XOyKBqYAFZaPIefZhJeDCFowOeLs8KFOuL+OmrELb/iPj8H6MAS7o2UG7mmwDEO1mzydKLZX/lWR9z8WJajywelXo49EfM9sAoXsawJODenZXiqGg4KcBd/tkBofYT6IvFxjOGM9+RTDrtYjLiJ854+Mx5qPcKVcgGgZf4X4ufK4Bf1O8/hm5y2Tj33gb3lgWczY0ptyCkDEqHl26QTtO0r9lMgEUnuJbknMFnce/DZlgJFT0kvVL2OuuqqCJN0L5SDaxaMvGRyT2idadgdUM8x/UmQMk0dM0dL4wWMigyQ+1SbcXrjH6erbg6WiAUptVeJp2fP4e5WpG9INu226l78TbhuMBG1+MBWhukavHIw1+PypMiKE1NHFjZLC+NWqv2teUNeQKgccuCY/WBLqtM/7mMOOMqv6/JiJdg+Bygo43852TTe10Ui0nXyWif4iaD0DbtgXs+B4OVbwCFBohpJVK+vWUJIbQoT2z4LQFpjtmuIgwIqNzISN1KQT8057hKcDHXFVygjdtnCcSr89nxVvzZtBmKPf8AuMDAQY7K57c1mjImN/Tw4UUp3tZi84XRhTOyhDle7Rk8jypqj3ltfAbwCrukOYowwgfdSInvYQ8uOLRYgHfC1mb0kAwEby5C12wdw3kHZNhV5Vw0t7rZNeaaMzekJ+LDmmuVewzrQHYbLk63Hc9gfuJHYUnoHWKQjzwmY9Ieb5v0pqTioq4TxyO7ADnHP1gxfM0Y3BHDvlf+aWLVo71112boB30KBxbr430F151N+yguux+AnFx2HnUzpUaJ87MTOnm2GNQQtENY4K8P6aBPWUR7epls5Cj7Y5upRX4RdULcueczCBXmRaURd+VaiGPjJ7AMh9QjWD1/n36wcd6nLGvJ3h+/YmEvdVe996pqxfIiLDH39rZHsDeAigYnySCtqXmYQ5cu+hY/q1QMbHAMEPfWY3W8UTgKM1qsWO1W3ZvokHJBQBrnihmVWJwU9+UwmqA4tLSAmzOv0O1oVgo6x89NRDDoHRjupLKK1X8xTLbmfj8WMNNcRTzY7WfumgqJ4IA7cHvDEBlaXvrV9DYOtITq2CbHSh0ci/8QsAH9FMzqAZRFroTNhDoYQp2jJn5/UdGjS2AaDTGQ2bnZG2H6t5s/nfd9fUk2+eym5QzNaXB7Tm4VaXYIjWBU6k4l8iQRt9p6GuPu7qgR0iCUYAjmO3TlV6XfIiD6uJLdkNG8FNkJXdG2UQzDxNZzN4vjH4Dg6Z5yLA89Ba0Df6V/TnNknnc1VXKWIPx8dqoSv8JJ3gjuJZIqWhFR4oNSwSEAOB3QEeGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2608,"cache_read_input_tokens":50568,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2608,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e","uuid":"423405b4-1c3b-4750-b911-638dadf24f6e"}

The \"Sidebar displays all navigation links\" test failed because `text=Sales CRM` was not visible. Let me find a recording for that test.\n\nLet me analyze the page source to understand what's happening. Let me look at the app source code to understand what each page renders.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":16752,"cache_read_input_tokens":54284,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":16752,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e","uuid":"ceb3a8f8-248f-4bc9-a9ab-fd0a9e5cb0e0"}

The `settings-page` element exists in the DOM with a width of 1036px and height of 28px. It IS there. But the test says it can't find it (\"Expected: visible, Received: undefined\"). \n\nWait - the height is 28px. That's small but it should still be visible. Let me look at the height more carefully... the element has `p-6` padding class which should give it 24px padding. But the inspector shows padding as all 0px. So the padding isn't being applied. This could be a CSS issue with Tailwind not loading properly, or the element might not be rendering visible text.\n \nAh, I see the issue now - the \"Received: undefined\" error is misleading because the element was actually found in the DOM at the end of the recording, but it likely wasn't present during the initial 5-second visibility check. The element probably appears after the 30-second timeout completes, which is why the test fails even though we can see it in the final DOM snapshot. The Tailwind CSS classes might not be applying properly, which would explain why the padding shows as 0px in the inspector even though the element has the p-6 class. The element is technically in the DOM and has some height from the h1 text, but maybe there's a visibility issue I'm missing—let me reconsider why the toBeVisible check is failing when the page clearly loaded and rendered the SettingsPage component.\n\nLooking at the layout structure, the main element is positioned after the sidebar and the settings-page div itself is only 28px tall but overflows its parent significantly at the bottom, which suggests there might be a layout issue with how the content is being positioned or constrained.\n\nThe real problem might be that the full test timed out at 30 seconds while still waiting for the element to be visible — which makes me wonder if the navigation to `/settings` never actually completed and the page was stuck loading.\n\nLooking at the PlaywrightSteps, I only see the \"toBeVisible\" check at 31120ms, but no `goto` step listed before it. Either the navigation finished instantly and wasn't recorded, or the recording started after the page navigation began. I need to verify which test I'm actually looking at — the metadata shows a recording ID for a \"Clicking Clients link navigates to /clients\" test, but I should double-check if that matches what I'm analyzing. The test timed out waiting for the settings page to be visible, but the React component tree shows it's mounted and the DOM inspection confirms the element exists. The page loaded successfully with all network requests completing, so this feels like a CSS or visibility issue—maybe a display property problem with the root div's flex layout or a CSS variable affecting visibility. Since four tests passed and six failed, this looks like a timing or race condition rather than a complete failure. Let me check which tests actually passed to see if there's a pattern. Looking at the pattern, I notice the passing tests all start from `/clients` and interact with elements there, while the failing ones try to click navigation links that aren't found. Since tests run in parallel with `fullyParallel: true`, different browser contexts might be interfering with each other — one test could be navigating away while another is trying to interact with the sidebar, causing the element lookups to fail.\n\nBut actually, each test gets its own isolated browser context, so they shouldn't interfere at the DOM level. The real bottleneck is probably the dev server itself — when multiple tests run simultaneously, they're all hitting the same server instance, and under that load it might be too slow to respond or serve pages in time before the test timeout kicks in.\n\nExamining the Playwright webServer configuration...\n\nThe dev server is set to timeout after 30 seconds, same as the test timeout. With 10 tests running in parallel, the initial Vite compilation could be a major bottleneck, though subsequent page loads would benefit from caching. But the test results showing 5.4 minutes total runtime with only 4 passing suggests something deeper is wrong.\n\nLooking at the failure recording, the test navigated to `/settings` and rendered the SettingsPage component correctly, but something went wrong after that point.\n\nThe Playwright error shows `toBeVisible()` timed out, but the real issue is that the element wasn't found in the DOM at all when the assertion ran—it returned `undefined` rather than being hidden. The test step took 31,120ms, which is just over the 30-second timeout threshold, so the element may have appeared too late or the test gave up right at the boundary.\n\nLooking at the recording duration of 34.9 seconds, the page loaded after the test already timed out. The dev server was likely slow because all 10 tests were hitting it simultaneously for the first time, and the Vite server behind `netlify dev` struggles under that concurrent load.\n\nThe test suite took 5.4 minutes total for 10 tests with a 30-second timeout per test, which is extremely slow. I need to figure out whether this is a compilation bottleneck, a server startup issue, or something specific in the app code causing slow rendering. Let me look more closely at what was actually rendered in that screenshot at the 26.7-second mark to see if the page was even partially loaded.\n\nI'm wondering if the root div might be missing proper CSS styling or flex layout that's preventing the content from rendering

The `App` component wraps content in `<>...</>` (React fragment). The Sidebar is `sticky` and the main content area has `flex-1`. But for flex to work, the parent needs to be a flex container. The fragment `<>` is NOT a flex container. So `flex-1` and `flex-shrink-0` on the sidebar won't work properly.\n\n2. The `#root` div needs to be a flex container. Let me check the `index.css` or `main.tsx` to see if `#root` has flex styling.\n   \nLooking at the InspectElement output, I can see the actual dimensions: `#root` is 1280x720px and `<main>` is 1036x720px, positioned 244px from the left edge of `#root`. That 244px offset matches the sidebar width, and 244px + 1036px = 1280px, which accounts for the full width. The fact that the layout is actually working suggests `#root` must already be configured as a flex container.\n\nThe component structure uses a fragment at the top level, so the DOM effectively has `#root` containing the sidebar and main elements directly. If `#root` has `display: flex`, those two elements become flex children and the layout works as expected.\n\nNow I'm trying to understand why the test suite is having issues — specifically why 6 tests are timing out when running with `fullyParallel: true`.\n\nThe Replay browser likely has recording overhead that makes it slower than regular Chrome, and with the default 4 workers running tests simultaneously, the 30-second timeout isn't enough. The actual runtime of 5.4 minutes for 10 tests suggests significant slowness, probably from a combination of the Replay browser's performance and the `netlify dev` server wrapping Vite. I should increase the test timeout to give the Replay browser more time to complete.\n\nBut wait—the strategy warns against papering over problems by hard-coding values. Let me look at the actual error more carefully. In test 3, the page successfully loaded and `clients-list-page` became visible, but then the click on the nav link timed out. So the issue isn't that the page failed to load—it's that something after the initial page load is hanging.\n\nI'm wondering if the sidebar CSS variables aren't resolving properly, which could make the sidebar invisible or have zero width, making the element unclickable even though it technically exists in the DOM. Let me check what's happening with the CSS variables in the stylesheet.","signature":"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

That's correct for the sidebar + main layout. The sidebar has `w-[var(--sidebar-width)]` which uses `--sidebar-width: 244px`.\n\nNow, the SidebarNavLinks component uses icons from `lucide-react`. The icons used are:\n- `Building2` for Clients\n- `Users` for Contacts\n- `Handshake` for Deals\n- `CheckSquare` for Tasks\n- `UserCircle` for Team\n- `Settings` for Settings\n\nBut the test expects SVG icons via `el.locator('svg')`. \n\nThe lucide-react icons render as SVG elements, so that should work fine. Looking at the test IDs, they're generated dynamically based on the label in lowercase, so \"Team\" becomes `nav-link-team` and \"Settings\" becomes `nav-link-settings`, which matches what the tests are checking for.\n\nI'm noticing the icon component names in the tree don't always match their imports—like `CheckSquare` renders as `SquareCheckBig` and `UserCircle` as `CircleUser`—but those are just internal lucide-react naming conventions and shouldn't affect the tests. The app code looks correct, the test IDs are right, and the sidebar renders properly, so this is likely a timing issue.\n\nLooking at the page load, all network requests succeeded and React mounted the components, with `settings-page` present in the DOM. But the test timed out after 30 seconds, and the PlaywrightSteps only show one entry at 31120ms for the `toBeVisible` assertion. That's strange because the `page.goto('/settings')` call should appear as a separate step—if it's missing, that suggests the goto might have completed instantly but the DOM wasn't actually ready, or the element was there but Playwright couldn't interact with it.\n\nThe element itself has solid dimensions (1036x28px) and is positioned within the visible viewport, so it should be detectable. I'm wondering if the issue is that the CSS hasn't fully loaded yet—the Tailwind styles might be processing asynchronously, which could cause Playwright to see the element as not visible even though it's technically in the DOM.\n\nActually, I should reconsider the timeline here. The recording shows the final state with the element present, but that doesn't mean it was there during those first 30 seconds when Playwright was waiting. Let me add a logpoint to track when the SettingsPage component actually renders.","signature":"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

The test timeout is 30000ms. But wait — the PlaywrightSteps show the toBeVisible step at 31120ms, which is the step failing. The page.goto would have started at time 0. The SettingsPage rendered at 25.7 seconds. With a 30s test timeout, the remaining time for the toBeVisible assertion is only about 4.3 seconds after the page rendered (30s - 25.7s = 4.3s). With a default 5000ms timeout for toBeVisible... hmm, but the test timeout takes precedence.\n\n\nSo the test timeout of 30000ms is the total time for the entire test, and the toBeVisible has its own 5000ms default timeout. Since the page loaded at 25.7 seconds, there's only 4.3 seconds left before the test timeout kicks in, which is less than the 5000ms toBeVisible timeout — so the test timeout is what actually cuts off the assertion.\n\nBut if the SettingsPage is already rendered at 25.7s, the element should be visible immediately. The real issue is likely that `page.goto('/settings')` consumed most of the 30-second timeout waiting for the page's \"load\" event to fire, leaving almost no time for toBeVisible to actually check for the element.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture: the recording is 34.9 seconds but the test times out at 30 seconds, and the SettingsPage didn't render until 25.7 seconds. With 10 tests running in parallel, each one is hammering the Vite dev server to compile modules, which is causing severe slowdowns. Some tests finish quickly while others hit the timeout wall.\n\nThe solution is to either increase the timeout to handle the slower Replay browser under parallel load, reduce the number of concurrent workers, or add a warm-up step to pre-compile modules.\n\nBut the constraints are clear: tests must run in parallel, I can't set workers to 1, and I shouldn't paper over app problems. However, increasing the timeout to 60 seconds isn't papering over anything — the app works fine, it just needs more time when the dev server is under load from multiple parallel test runs. The pages that passed probably loaded faster because Vite had already compiled their modules, while the failing tests hit the compilation queue first.\n\nActually, 25.7 seconds just to render a settings page is suspicious — that's too slow even accounting for dev server overhead. Let me look at the webServer configuration more carefully. The `netlify dev` command starts Vite behind a proxy, but the webServer timeout is only 30 seconds, same as the test timeout. If the server is slow to start, early tests would fail before it's ready. Looking at the total runtime of 5.4 minutes across 10 tests with 30-second timeouts, the math suggests the tests ran mostly sequentially rather than in true parallel, which points to a server startup or resource bottleneck.\n\nThe real issue is probably that the Replay browser is slow in dev mode and the timeout is too aggressive. I should bump the test timeout to 60 seconds in the Playwright config and see if that helps more tests pass. I also need to check whether the webServer needs the `--functions` flag based on the deployment strategy.\n\nLooking at the failing tests more carefully, some tests that navigate to `/clients` are passing while others fail, which suggests the issue isn't consistent across all pages. Let me trace through what's happening with the `/tasks` page specifically, since that's where one of the timeouts is occurring. link-contacts')\" in the logs, which means it's stuck waiting for that element to exist. But if the clients-list-page is visible, the sidebar should be there too. Maybe the sidebar is being rendered but the test IDs aren't being applied correctly, or there's a timing issue where the sidebar renders after the page content. Let me check if there's a race condition between the sidebar and page rendering. The navItems array is hardcoded, so those links should always render when SidebarNavLinks mounts. But looking back at test 3's error more carefully — it hit the 30-second test timeout waiting for the nav link element, not a locator timeout. The test successfully navigated to `/clients` and confirmed the page was visible, yet the sidebar nav link never appeared in the DOM, which suggests the sidebar itself might not be rendering or mounting at all in that test environment. If the sidebar nav links are already in the DOM when `clients-list-page` becomes visible, the click should succeed immediately—but maybe the sidebar or its nav links are rendering after the main content, or they haven't been appended to the DOM yet even though the page is visible. In React, though, the entire component tree should render and commit in one pass, so if `clients-list-page` is in the DOM, the sidebar nav links should be too.\n\nLet me check the icon imports in SidebarNavLinks—I'm seeing imports from lucide-react for Building2, Users, Handshake, CheckSquare, UserCircle, and Settings, but there's a mismatch between what's imported and what's actually being used in the component tree.\n\nLooking at the pragmatic approach here: I should increase the test timeout to 60 seconds since the Replay browser runs slower, then re-run to see if that resolves the timing issues. If tests still fail after that, I'll need to dig deeper. I also want to verify that the nav links are properly wrapped in list item elements, since the test is looking for specific selectors within the sidebar

[2026-02-23T22:35:41.107Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01MhubEFMWVnPV54uRb4G2SH","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"I see. The test has a `beforeEach` that:1. Goes to `/clients`\n2. Removes localStorage token\n3. Reloads the page\n\nThe `beforeEach` went to `/clients` (consuming some time), then the page.evaluate + reload consumed more time. By the time the test got to filling the form, 53 seconds were already used. The click on the submit button at step 8 (53278ms) is already very close to the 60s timeout. The click finds the button, attempts to click it, but there's not enough time left for the full auth flow to complete (signup, then signout, then signin).\n\n\nThe click action itself succeeded—the button was found, scrolled into view, and clicked. But after that, the test needs to wait for the signup to complete and the `user-name` element to appear, and by that point the 60-second timeout has already been exceeded.\n\nLooking at the timing breakdown, the `beforeEach` hook consumed 37 seconds just to navigate to '/clients'—the initial Vite compilation took 28 seconds alone. That leaves only 23 seconds for the actual test steps (form filling, clicking, waiting for completion, signing out, signing back in, verifying), which isn't enough time given all the API calls involved.\n\nThe real bottleneck is the slow initial page load in the Replay browser during that first Vite compilation, though subsequent navigations are faster since the modules are cached. there are only 2 workers and 8 tests. The first 2 tests that run will trigger Vite compilation. After that, subsequent tests should be faster because Vite has cached everything.\n\nLooking at the successful tests: test 1 (Sign In button) passed in 40.6s, test 2 (auth form) in 51.6s. These are slow but passed. Tests 3 (Sign In form submits) and 7 (Logged in state) failed. These tests are more complex — they have multi-step flows with API calls.\n\nThe real issue is that these tests do a LOT: beforeEach loads the page (slow), removes token, reloads (slow again), then the test does signup + signout + signin. Each step is slow in the Replay browser.\n\nThe beforeEach setup alone is eating 36 seconds — the initial page load takes 28 seconds and the reload adds another 8 seconds. Then test 3 compounds this with a complex flow: clicking the sign-in button, toggling to sign up mode, filling out the form across multiple steps, submitting, and waiting for the user to be authenticated. I could optimize by skipping the reload if the token removal is sufficient, or just increase the timeout further to 120 seconds.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the beforeEach might be completely unnecessary. Since Playwright gives each test a fresh browser context, there's no stale localStorage to clear. Let me verify whether the beforeEach is even doing anything useful. The real bottleneck is that reload after removing the token — since each test gets its own fresh context anyway, I can skip both the token removal and the reload, just navigating to `/clients` directly. Let me check if there's any automatic token initialization happening on page load that would affect this approach.\n\nLooking at the test results, I notice tests 6 and 8 passed despite doing similar operations to test 3, which failed. The key difference is test 3 runs a longer sequence — signup, signout, then signin again — while the passing tests stop earlier. This suggests the issue might be cumulative complexity or timing across multiple auth state transitions rather than a single operation.\n\nThe beforeEach setup is likely the culprit. With 2 workers, the first tests trigger Vite compilation, making them slow. Test 3 probably hit that initial compilation penalty, pushing it over the 60-second timeout. I should either increase the timeout to 90-120 seconds or optimize the beforeEach setup to reduce overhead.\n\nLooking at test 1 more closely, it expects the sign-in button to be visible after navigating to `/clients`. Since a fresh context has no auth state by default, I can simplify the beforeEach by removing the token cleanup and page reload—just navigating to the page should be enough to ensure the unauthenticated state the tests expect.

The auth API request (POST to `/.netlify/functions/auth`) had \"No response was received.\" This means the auth function never responded. This is why the test timed out — it submitted the signup form but the backend never responded, so the authentication never completed.\n\nAlso, notice that many of the page reload requests returned \"No response was received\" — particularly the Vite deps (react, react-dom, react-redux, etc.) and the lucide-react module. This suggests the dev server became unresponsive partway through the test.\n\nBut wait — the `reload()` step succeeded (completed in 7920ms). So the second page load worked. \n\nThe auth API call itself failed to respond, which could be a timeout issue since the click happened at 53278ms with only about 6.7 seconds left before the 60-second test limit — if the auth function has latency issues with the database connection, it might not complete in time. Or the request could still be pending when the recording ended.\n\nLooking at the timing, the auth request was pending for about 5 seconds (from 53s to 58.3s when the recording stopped), which might not be enough for a database operation on an ephemeral Neon branch. The real issue is a combination of slow page loads eating into the test timeout, the beforeEach reload adding unnecessary overhead, and complex multi-step test flows. I should remove that unnecessary reload since each test gets a fresh context, or increase the test timeout to 120 seconds for these auth tests.\n\nActually, the simplest fix is to keep the beforeEach but strip it down to just navigating to `/clients` without the localStorage cleanup and reload—that saves about 10 seconds per test. Test 3 is particularly heavy with sign up, sign out, and sign in flows involving multiple network calls, so even with the optimized beforeEach, a 60-second timeout might be cutting it close. I'll bump it up to 90 seconds to give these complex flows enough breathing room.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8224,"cache_read_input_tokens":98688,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8224,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e","uuid":"88b38209-b145-411a-bfdd-717f89a8b3df"}

But 2 tests still fail. The failures are now:\n\n1. Test 3 \"Sign In form submits with email and password\" - After signing up (clicking submit), waiting for `user-name` to be visible times out after 10 seconds. The element was not found. This means the sign-up didn't complete successfully.\n\n2. Test 6 \"Logged in state shows avatar, name, and sign-out\" - After signing up, waiting for `user-area` to be visible times out after 10 seconds. Same issue.\n \nThe issue is that tests 3 and 6 fail because authentication doesn't complete after the submit button is clicked, but tests 7 and 8 pass despite also performing signups. I'm wondering if the difference is in the timeout duration or some other timing-related factor between the passing and failing tests.\n\nLooking at the actual test code, tests 3 and 7 are nearly identical — both click the auth submit button and wait for the user-name element to appear with a 10000ms timeout. Yet one passes and one fails, which points to either a flaky test or intermittent auth endpoint failures. I should check the uploaded recording to see what's actually happening during the failed signup attempts.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2042,"cache_read_input_tokens":108783,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2042,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e","uuid":"a3cefa7f-89bd-4079-9a99-b59e567ac250"}

Since this happened at 38788ms and the toBeVisible timeout window extended to 40227ms, the assertion should have caught the user-name element becoming visible.\n\nBut the test failed saying the element wasn't found after the full 10 second timeout, which suggests either Render 8 didn't actually create the user-name element in the DOM, or there's an error I'm missing in the processing output.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":714,"cache_read_input_tokens":120191,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":714,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e","uuid":"f0be5ec3-eb58-4791-839d-757c6847da62"}

It was rendered by SidebarUserArea at Point:18. The element is 190px wide and 19.5px tall, so it's visible.\n\nBut the test said it waited from 30227ms with 10000ms timeout (until 40227ms). The render at Point:16 happened at 38788ms. So the element should have become visible at ~38788ms, which is within the 10s timeout (30227ms + 10000ms = 40227ms).\n\nWait - the Playwright step was at 30227ms with 10000ms timeout. \n\nThe math checks out: the element appeared at 38788ms with over a second to spare before the 40227ms deadline, yet Playwright still reported \"element(s) not found\". Looking at the actual error message, it's saying the locator `getByTestId('user-name')` couldn't find anything despite the element clearly being rendered and visible in the recording.\n\nI'm wondering if there's a disconnect between the Replay recording's timestamps and Playwright's actual wall-clock time—the recording might have been slowed down or the timestamps might not correspond to real execution. Or perhaps the element rendered at 38788ms in the recording actually occurred after Playwright's timeout had already expired in the real test run.\n\nLet me reconsider the sequence: the submit button click took 5038ms (from 25188ms to 30226ms), which is unusually slow, and the auth API returned a 201 status during that click. I need to figure out exactly when the POST request was actually made.\n\nLooking at the network activity, the POST to `/.netlify/functions/auth` succeeded with a 201 response, but it seems the Redux state update from `signUp.fulfilled` didn't trigger a re-render fast enough—the Replay shows the user is eventually logged in, but in real execution this happened after the Playwright timeout had already expired. The render at 38788ms appears to be triggered by the network response based on the dependency chain, so if that response arrived too late, that would explain why the element visibility check timed out.\n\nThe Replay browser's recording overhead likely adds latency to DOM mutations, which could be delaying Playwright's detection even though 1.4 seconds should theoretically be enough. I think the issue is that the auth API response is slow, and combined with the recording overhead, the 10-second timeout is just too tight. Let me check how the passing tests handle this—test 7 also does a signup and waits for the same element, so I should see what timeout it uses.\n\nLooking at test 7, it passed in 57.7 seconds using the same 10-second timeout, which means the flow works sometimes. The difference might be that test 7 ran in a different worker or the database was already warmed up by that point. Let me examine the test execution order to see if there's a pattern with which tests pass and which fail. Test 3 failed at 44.6s total — the goto step took about 8 seconds, form filling and submission stretched to around 30 seconds, then it waited 10 seconds for the username to appear (reaching 40 seconds), though the element actually rendered at 39 seconds. The timing math is interesting: if the visibility check started at 30 seconds with a 10-second timeout, it should have failed around 40 seconds, but the full test time of 44.6 seconds suggests the framework added overhead recording the failure. I'm suspecting the auth API is the bottleneck here — the Neon database is remote, and the authentication function needs to make calls across the network.\n\nI'm thinking I should bump the timeout from 10 seconds to 30 seconds for auth-related assertions, giving more breathing room for this environment without masking actual problems. The app itself is working fine — the auth API returned a 201 status with valid data and Redux updated correctly — so this is purely an environmental issue with the Replay browser and remote database being slower than production. This isn't papering over a real bug, it's accounting for the test infrastructure overhead.\n\nLooking back at the dependency chain for this render, I see the four input events firing for the form fields, then the network request initiating and completing with data received. The Redux store updated and triggered the re-render as expected.\n\nThe timing shows the click started at 25188ms and ended at 30226ms, with the render happening at 38788ms — that's about 13.6 seconds total from click to render, which seems excessive for an API roundtrip and Redux processing. The render did occur within the 10-second timeout window that Playwright was waiting for, but the test still failed because it couldn't find the element in the DOM during that window.\n\nI'm wondering if there's a race condition where Playwright's polling missed the exact moment the element appeared, though that seems unlikely with modern Playwright's mutation observers. More likely, the Replay recording overhead introduced enough delay that the timeout expired before the mutation was detected. The most pragmatic fix is to increase the auth-related timeouts from 10 seconds to 30 seconds, since the API is clearly slow in this test environment.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the test timeline to see if the overall 60-second test timeout has enough headroom. With the auth step potentially taking up to 30 seconds, plus the other steps like navigation, clicking, and form filling, I need to make sure the test doesn't hit the global timeout before the assertions complete. I'm reconsidering the timeout strategy—bumping it to 120s would make parallel execution too slow, so instead I'll try increasing just the assertion timeouts to 30s and see if that fits within the 60s global limit, since the auth sequences typically complete in 50s total.\n\nLooking back at the passing tests, I notice that simpler flows like signup and signout finished in under 31s, but the more complex test combining signup, signout, and signin is timing out—it's just too ambitious for 60s with the Replay browser, so I'll need to increase the timeout for that specific test. passed at 57.7s. Test 3 is the most complex because it does signup + signout + signin.\n\nLet me increase the assertion timeouts and add specific test timeouts for the complex tests. I don't want to increase the global timeout to 120s because that would make all tests potentially wait 120s before timing out, making failure detection slow.\n\nActually, I'll keep the global timeout at 60s but increase it for specific tests. Playwright supports `test.slow()` to triple the timeout, or `test.setTimeout()` to set a specific timeout.\n\nLet me use `test.slow()` for the complex auth tests, which triples the 60s to 180s. That's more than enough. Actually, I'll be more precise and use `test.setTimeout(120000)` for the complex tests instead.\n\nThe simpler approach is just to increase the assertion timeouts. If assertions pass within 30s, the test should complete within 60s total since the other steps are quick. Looking at test 3's timing breakdown, the goto takes about 8s on a warm run, then the signup flow with field fills and submissions adds up to roughly 10-15s for the user-name wait, followed by the signout and signin sequence which mirrors that pattern with another 10-15s for the user-avatar wait.\n\nAdding those up: 8 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 12 comes to about 45s, which fits comfortably within the 60s timeout. So I'll increase the assertion timeouts to 30s and see if that resolves the flakiness. If tests still fail, I can add per-test timeouts as a

The reload (line 13) duplicates the full page load, adding ~8 seconds. Since Playwright Test creates a fresh browser context for each `test()` call, localStorage is already empty — no token needs to be removed. The fix is to simplify the `beforeEach` to just `page.goto('/clients')` without the token removal and reload, saving ~10 seconds per test.","new_string":"# Bug: Sign In form submits with email and password\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: None found. Recording 05263ba5 shows the auth API endpoint (POST /.netlify/functions/auth) returned 201 with valid user data and token: `{\"user\":{\"id\":\"...\",\"email\":\"...\",\"name\":\"Test User\"},\"token\":\"...\"}`. The Redux store was correctly updated (signUp.fulfilled at Render 8, timestamp 38788ms), and the SidebarUserArea component re-rendered showing user-name span (190x19.5px, visible at Point:18). InspectElement confirms the element exists with correct dimensions.\n\nEvidence the test is broken: Two issues found:\n1. The `beforeEach` hook wastes ~36 seconds with unnecessary localStorage removal and reload (fresh Playwright contexts have no stored state).\n2. The auth assertion timeout of 10000ms is too tight for the Replay browser + Neon DB environment. The auth API roundtrip takes ~8-13 seconds (Neon DB cold connection + Replay recording overhead), and the React re-render happens at ~38788ms. With the Playwright step ending at ~30227ms and a 10s timeout (expiring at ~40227ms), the render at 38788ms is within the window but with only ~1.4s margin. This margin is insufficient for reliable detection in the Replay browser, which has additional overhead for DOM mutation recording.\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: TEST\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\nTwo test configuration issues in `tests/sidebar-auth.spec.ts`:\n1. The `beforeEach` performs unnecessary `localStorage.removeItem('token')` + `page.reload()` since Playwright creates fresh browser contexts per test.\n2. Auth assertion timeouts of `{ timeout: 10000 }` are too tight. The Neon DB ephemeral branch connection + auth processing + Replay browser recording overhead means the signUp/signIn flow takes 10-15 seconds from API call to DOM update. Increasing to `{ timeout: 30000 }` provides reliable margins."},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":18566,"cache_read_input_tokens":121691,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":18566,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e","uuid":"de595640-b392-4a36-ad13-75f896851a88"}

The second auth call was sent with `action: \"signup\"` instead of `action: \"signin\"`. Look at the request body:\n\n```json\n{\"action\":\"signup\",\"email\":\"test-1771886676429-gztrb4@example.com\",\"password\":\"testpass123\",\"name\":\"Test User\"}\n```\n\nThis is a SIGNUP request, not a signin request! The test is clicking the sign-in form's submit button, but the form is submitting as \"signup\" instead of \"signin\".\n\nLet me look at the test code again:\n```ts\n// Sign out so we can test sign in\n\n\n```\n\nThe test signs out first, then clicks the sign-in button to display the form and fills in the credentials before submitting. So the form should definitely be in sign-in mode, not signup mode.\n\nI'm realizing the issue: the `SidebarUserArea` component maintains local state for `isSignUp`, and when the user signs out, the component re-renders but doesn't unmount, so that state persists. Even though the sign-in button appears after sign-out, the `isSignUp` flag is still `true` from the previous signup toggle, which means the form will render in signup mode instead of sign-in mode when clicked. , `isSignUp` is still `true` in local state! So when the user signs out and clicks \"Sign In\" again, the form appears but stays in \"Sign Up\" mode, causing it to send a signup request instead of a sign-in request—that's why we're hitting the 409 conflict. The fix is to reset `isSignUp` to `false` whenever the \"Sign In\" button is clicked.\n\nResetting the toggle

Let me analyze this recording.\n\n\nI'm checking whether the sign-in API call actually went through this time with the isSignUp fix applied.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":145006,"cache_read_input_tokens":18845,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":145006,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e","uuid":"0d15d356-99a6-47b2-a8ab-025ac0d117a8"}

[2026-02-23T22:56:51.797Z] {"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation to capture all important details.\n\n1. The user asked to read the strategy file `strategies/jobs/build/testing.md` and complete the job \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\".\n\n2. I read AGENTS.md and the testing strategy file. The strategy requires:\n   - Reading Replay CLI and MCP skill files\n   - Using Replay browser for recording test runs\n   - Running tests via `npm run test <testFile>`\n   - Following a specific debugging process with Replay MCP tools\n   - Writing bug writeups before making fixes\n\n3. I explored the app structure - found SalesCRM app with 2 test files:\n   - `tests/sidebar-nav.spec.ts` (10 tests for navigation)\n   - `tests/sidebar-auth.spec.ts` (8 tests for authentication)\n\n4. First issue: Replay browser not installed. Fixed by running `npx replayio install`.\n\n5. Second issue: Playwright config was using `devices['Desktop Chrome']` instead of `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Fixed the playwright config.\n\n6. Third issue: OpenSSL 1.1 missing for Replay browser recording. Downloaded and extracted libssl1.1.deb, updated test script to include LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\n\n7. First test run of sidebar-nav: 4 passed, 6 failed (all timeouts). Analysis showed SettingsPage rendered at 25698ms - nearly the full 30s timeout. Root cause: Replay browser is slower + parallel tests overwhelm dev server.\n\n8. Fix: Increased test timeout from 30000ms to 60000ms, webServer timeout to 60000ms, added `['list']` and `['json']` reporters, removed `projects` array (using replayDevices instead).\n\n9. Second sidebar-nav run: ALL 10 PASSED.\n\n10. First sidebar-auth run: 6 passed, 2 failed. The `beforeEach` was doing unnecessary `localStorage.removeItem('token')` + `page.reload()` consuming 36 seconds.\n\n11. Fix: Simplified `beforeEach` to just `await page.goto('/clients')`.\n\n12. Second sidebar-auth run: Still 2 failed. Auth assertion timeout of 10000ms too tight. Neon DB + Replay browser overhead means auth takes 10-15s.\n\n13. Fix: Changed all `{ timeout: 10000 }` to `{ timeout: 30000 }`.\n\n14. Third sidebar-auth run: 6 passed, 2 failed differently. Now discovered the REAL bug: second POST to auth returned 409 Conflict because the request body was `{\"action\":\"signup\",...}` instead of `{\"action\":\"signin\",...}`. The `isSignUp` local state wasn't being reset when clicking \"Sign In\" button after signing out.\n\n15. Fix: Updated `SidebarUserArea.tsx` onClick for sign-in button to reset `isSignUp`, `email`, `password`, `name`, `message` state.\n\n16. Fourth sidebar-auth run: 7 passed, 1 failed. Test 3 \"Sign In form submits\" still failing - the test timeout of 60s is exceeded because the complex multi-step flow (signup + signout + signin) takes too long. The second auth POST (signin) received \"No response was received\" - meaning the test timed out before the API responded.\n\nLooking at the PlaywrightSteps:\n- Step 13: Click auth-submit-button at 48000ms, duration 13283ms\n- Step 14: toBeVisible starts at 61360ms (already past 60s test timeout)\n\nThe test takes 61+ seconds total, exceeding the 60s test timeout. The second signin click alone took 13.3 seconds. The test needs a longer timeout for this complex flow.\n\nCurrent state: \n- sidebar-nav.spec.ts: ALL 10 PASS\n- sidebar-auth.spec.ts: 7 of 8 pass, test 3 \"Sign In form submits with email and password\" fails due to 60s test timeout being exceeded for the complex signup+signout+signin flow\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user asked to read the strategy file `strategies/jobs/build/testing.md` and complete the job \"FixTests: Get all tests passing.\" This involves running all Playwright tests in the SalesCRM app and getting them to pass, following the debugging strategy which requires using Replay browser recordings and MCP tools to analyze failures before making fixes.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Playwright testing with Replay Chromium browser for recording test runs\n   - `@replayio/playwright` integration with `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` and `replayReporter`\n   - OpenSSL 1.1 requirement for Replay browser recording driver\n   - Neon ephemeral database branches for test isolation\n   - Redux state management for auth (authSlice with signIn/signUp/signOut/loadSession async thunks)\n   - React local component state persistence across re-renders (the isSignUp bug)\n   - Replay MCP tools: PlaywrightSteps, Screenshot, ConsoleMessages, NetworkRequest, InspectElement, ReactComponents, ReactRenders, DescribeReactRender, DescribePoint\n   - Test script (`scripts/test.ts`) manages: kill stale processes → cleanup branches → create ephemeral branch → init schema → seed → remove recordings → run playwright → handle failed recordings → cleanup\n   - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for OpenSSL 1.1 compatibility with Replay browser\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/playwright.config.ts`\n     - Critical for test execution configuration\n     - Changed from `devices['Desktop Chrome']` to `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n     - Added apiKey to replayReporter, replaced html reporter with json+list\n     - Removed `projects` array, spread replayDevices into global `use`\n     - Increased timeout from 30000 to 60000, webServer timeout to 60000\n     ```typescript\n     import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test'\n     import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright'\n     \n     export default defineConfig({\n       testDir: './tests',\n       fullyParallel: true,\n       forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,\n       retries: 0,\n       timeout: 60000,\n       reporter: [\n         replayReporter({\n           apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n           upload: false,\n         }),\n         ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n         ['list'],\n       ],\n       use: {\n         ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n         baseURL: 'http://localhost:8888',\n         trace: 'on-first-retry',\n       },\n       webServer: {\n         command: 'npx netlify dev --port 8888',\n         port: 8888,\n         reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,\n         timeout: 60000,\n         env: {\n           DATABASE_URL: process.env.DATABASE_URL || '',\n           IS_TEST: process.env.IS_TEST || 'true',\n         },\n       },\n     })\n     ```\n\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/test.ts`\n     - Modified to add `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for OpenSSL 1.1 when running Playwright\n     ```typescript\n     execSync(`npx playwright test ${testFile} --retries 0`, {\n       stdio: 'inherit',\n       env: {\n         ...process.env,\n         DATABASE_URL: databaseUrl,\n         LD_LIBRARY_PATH: '/tmp/libssl1.1/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu' + (process.env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH ? ':' + process.env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH : ''),\n       },\n     })\n     ```\n\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/SidebarUserArea.tsx`\n     - Contains the AUTH BUG: `isSignUp` state wasn't reset when clicking \"Sign In\" button\n     - Fixed by adding state resets in the onClick handler:\n     ```typescript\n     onClick={() => {\n       setShowForm(true)\n       setIsSignUp(false)\n       setEmail('')\n       setPassword('')\n       setName('')\n       setMessage('')\n       dispatch(clearError())\n     }}\n     ```\n\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/sidebar-auth.spec.ts`\n     - Simplified `beforeEach` from:\n       ```typescript\n       test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n         await page.goto('/clients')\n         await page.evaluate(() => localStorage.removeItem('token'))\n         await page.reload()\n       })\n       ```\n       To:\n       ```typescript\n       test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n         await page.goto('/clients')\n       })\n       ```\n     - Changed all auth assertion timeouts from `{ timeout: 10000 }` to `{ timeout: 30000 }`\n\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/sidebar-nav.spec.ts` - Read but not modified; all 10 tests pass\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` - Read; routing structure verified correct\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.tsx` - Read; sidebar structure verified\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/SidebarNavLinks.tsx` - Read; nav links verified\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts` - Read; Redux auth logic verified correct\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` - Read; simple static component\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css` - Read; verified `#root` has `display: flex; min-height: 100vh`\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx` - Read; React setup verified\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugs/SidebarNavLinks.md` - Created bug writeup for nav timeout issues\n   - `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugs/SignInFormSubmits.md` - Created and updated bug writeup for auth issues\n\n4. Errors and Fixes:\n   - **Replay browser not installed**: `npx replayio install` fixed it\n   - **Playwright config using wrong browser**: Changed from `devices['Desktop Chrome']` to `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` with proper imports\n   - **OpenSSL 1.1 missing**: Downloaded Ubuntu 18.04 libssl1.1 deb to `/tmp/libssl1.1/`, set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in test script\n   - **sidebar-nav tests timing out (6 of 10 failed)**: Increased test timeout to 60000ms and webServer timeout to 60000ms. Root cause was Replay browser overhead + parallel test compilation load on Vite dev server\n   - **sidebar-auth beforeEach wasting ~36 seconds**: Removed unnecessary `localStorage.removeItem('token')` + `page.reload()` since Playwright creates fresh browser contexts per test\n   - **Auth assertion timeouts too tight (10s)**: Increased to 30s to accommodate Neon DB + Replay browser overhead\n   - **APP BUG - isSignUp state not reset**: After signing up, signing out, and clicking \"Sign In\" again, the form was still in sign-up mode because `isSignUp` local state was `true`. The second auth POST sent `action: \"signup\"` resulting in 409 Conflict \"Email already in use\". Fixed by resetting all form state in the Sign In button onClick handler.\n   - **CURRENT - Test 3 \"Sign In form submits\" exceeds 60s test timeout**: The complex multi-step flow (signup + signout + signin) takes 61+ seconds. The second signin click alone took 13.3s. The toBeVisible assertion starts at 61360ms, already past the 60s timeout. Need to either increase the global test timeout or add `test.slow()` for this specific test.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - sidebar-nav.spec.ts: ALL 10 TESTS PASS ✅\n   - sidebar-auth.spec.ts: 7 of 8 tests pass, 1 remaining failure\n   - The remaining failure is test 3 \"Sign In form submits with email and password\" which times out at 60s because it's a complex multi-step flow (signup → wait → signout → signin → wait → verify). The app code is now correct (isSignUp bug fixed), but the test needs more time. The second auth POST never received a response (\"No response was received\") because the test timed out at 60s before the API responded.\n\n6. All User Messages:\n   - Initial message: \"Read strategy file: strategies/jobs/build/testing.md. Jobs to complete: 1. FixTests: Get all tests passing. Work through each job following the strategy. When you have completed ALL jobs, output <DONE> to signal completion.\"\n   - System reminder about TodoWrite tool usage (multiple times, automated)\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Fix test 3 \"Sign In form submits with email and password\" in sidebar-auth.spec.ts - needs more time for the complex signup+signout+signin flow (currently exceeds 60s timeout)\n   - After fixing, re-run both test files to verify ALL tests pass\n   - Run `npm run check` before final verification\n   - Output `<DONE>` when all tests pass\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Working on fixing the last failing test: `sidebar-auth.spec.ts` test 3 \"Sign In form submits with email and password\". The Replay recording analysis (`85c795a3-7b69-4dd2-84a6-8670b48a93d8`) shows:\n   - PlaywrightSteps: Step 13 (Click auth-submit-button for signin) starts at 48000ms with 13283ms duration. Step 14 (toBeVisible user-avatar) starts at 61360ms - already past the 60s test timeout.\n   - Network: First POST auth returned 201 (signup success), second POST auth received \"No response was received\" (timed out before response).\n   - The app code fix (isSignUp reset) is correct - the form now properly sends `action: \"signin\"` for the second call.\n   - The issue is purely timing: the total test flow exceeds the 60s test timeout.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Add `test.slow()` at the beginning of test 3 \"Sign In form submits with email and password\" to triple the timeout (60s → 180s), since this is the most complex auth test with signup+signout+signin flow. Then re-run `npm run test tests/sidebar-auth.spec.ts` to verify all 8 tests pass. If successful, also re-run `npm run test tests/sidebar-nav.spec.ts` to confirm all tests still pass, then output `<DONE>`.\n\n   Evidence from most recent work: The PlaywrightSteps show the test needs ~61+ seconds minimum (step 14 starts at 61360ms), exceeding the 60s timeout. The app logic is correct (auth API would return 200 for signin if given enough time).\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /home/agent/.claude/projects/-repo/70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions.

Recording 05263ba5 shows the auth API endpoint (POST /.netlify/functions/auth) returned 201 with valid user data and token. The Redux store was correctly updated (signUp.fulfilled at Render 8, timestamp 38788ms), and the SidebarUserArea component re-rendered showing user-name span (190x19.5px, visible at Point:18). InspectElement confirms the element exists with correct dimensions.\n\nEvidence the test is broken: Two issues found:\n1. The `beforeEach` hook wastes ~36 seconds with unnecessary localStorage removal and reload (fresh Playwright contexts have no stored state).\n2. The auth assertion timeout of 10000ms is too tight for the Replay browser + Neon DB environment. The auth API roundtrip takes ~8-13 seconds (Neon DB cold connection + Replay recording overhead), and the React re-render happens at ~38788ms. With the Playwright step ending at ~30227ms and a 10s timeout (expiring at ~40227ms), the render at 38788ms is within the window but with only ~1.4s margin. This margin is insufficient for reliable detection in the Replay browser.\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: TEST\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\nTwo test configuration issues in `tests/sidebar-auth.spec.ts`:\n1.

This caused a 409 Conflict on the signup→signout→signin flow because the form sent `action: \"signup\"` instead of `action: \"signin\"`.\n\n### Results\n- **sidebar-nav.spec.ts**: 10/10 passed\n- **sidebar-auth.spec.ts**: 8/8 passed\n- **`npm run check`**: All checks passed\n\n<DONE>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"70075956-0811-4938-aaa4-d7cd4828e07e","total_cost_usd":7.90447255,"usage":{"input_tokens":79,"cache_creation_input_tokens":489295,"cache_read_input_tokens":5438229,"output_tokens":38254,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":489295},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":82,"outputTokens":42027,"cacheReadInputTokens":5438229,"cacheCreationInputTokens":637522,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":7.754712,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":28372,"outputTokens":8646,"cacheReadInputTokens":304798,"cacheCreationInputTokens":38143,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.14976055000000002,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"e5a84874-ba9a-4ea2-8edf-af2daf4c2be8"}
