The skill mentions `docs/bugReports.md` but I see individual bug files under app directories.\n\nLet me check if there's a top-level bugReports.md anywhere, or if it needs to be found in app-specific directories.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, I see the bug reports are individual markdown files under `apps/<AppName>/docs/bugs/`. Let me re-read the skill - it refers to `docs/bugReports.md` specifically as a single file. Maybe it doesn't exist yet and needs to be created, or maybe the bugs are in a different format.\n\n\nI should search more broadly for any file containing \"bugReports\" in its name to see if it exists elsewhere in the codebase.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1450,"cache_read_input_tokens":27418,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1450,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b00a5882-a92c-4a09-8ced-74f4b0125398","uuid":"db4d6357-da8e-4b6b-9c2c-ac5b069e3473"}
