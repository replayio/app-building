There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    69→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    70→\n    71→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    72→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"cbf8ac4e-9b35-4e39-9288-3cf4c6e509bf","uuid":"06d189ac-7113-4165-9474-e7f0ec423ac6","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"cbf8ac4e-9b35-4e39-9288-3cf4c6e509bf","uuid":"6855ff64-54a0-4bc1-ab9b-ef006ab469fd","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

ROUTING SETUP (App.tsx)\n\nThe app uses React Router v7 with three main routes:\n\n```typescript\nGET /              → DashboardPage (main dashboard)\nGET /suppliers/:supplierId → SupplierDetailsPage (supplier details - placeholder)\nGET /orders/:orderId       → OrderDetailsPage (order details - placeholder)\nGET * (catch-all)  → Navigate to /\n```\n\n**TopNavBar.tsx** provides navigation with links to Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders, Inventory. All nav items currently navigate to \"/\" but have active state tracking based on pathname.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

STYLING SETUP\n\n#### **CSS Architecture**\n1. **Shared tokens** (`/repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css`):\n   - Color variables (accent-primary: #4d7c5e, status colors, text colors)\n   - Font families, shadows, sizing constants\n   - Dark theme variables (unused in SupplierTracker currently)\n\n2. **Global styles** (`src/index.css`):\n   - Imports shared tokens + layout + common\n   - App-specific status badge colors (supplier: active/inactive/on-hold/suspended)\n   - Order status colors (pending/in-transit/fulfilled/processing/completed/cancelled/approved/shipped/delivered)\n   - Reusable classes: `.badge`, `.section-card`, `.data-table`, `.btn-primary/.btn-secondary/.btn-ghost/.btn-danger`, `.form-*`, `.modal-*`, `.page-*`, etc.\n\n3. **Component-specific CSS**:\n   - `TopNavBar.css` - Header styles\n   - `QuickActions.css` - Modal and form layouts\n   - `SuppliersList.css` - Card grid responsive design\n   - `UpcomingOrdersTable.css` - Table styling\n\n#### **Design System**\n- **Accent Primary:** #4d7c5e (green)\n- **Text Primary:** #26231e (dark brown)\n- **Status Success:** #4d7c5e (green, Active/Fulfilled/Approved/Delivered)\n- **Status Warning:** #b08a3e (amber, On Hold/Pending/Processing)\n- **Status Error:** #b05050 (red, Suspended/Cancelled)\n- **Status Info:** #5a7a8a (blue, In Transit/Shipped)\n\n---\n\n### 8. SHARED COMPONENTS & UTILITIES\n\n#### **Shared Components** (`/repo/apps/shared/components/`)\n\n1. **SearchableSelect.tsx**\n   - Used for supplier selection in \"Create Order\" modal\n   - Props: `options` (id/label), `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `testId`\n   - Filters on text input with dropdown\n\n2. **FilterSelect.tsx**\n   - Used for status and supplier filters in UpcomingOrdersTable\n   - Props: `options` (value/label), `value`, `onChange`, `searchable`, `testId`\n   - Dropdown with optional search\n\n3. **Breadcrumb.tsx**, **CategorySection.tsx**, **CommentsSection.tsx**, **ConfirmDialog.tsx**, **DocumentsSection.tsx**, **ImportDialog.tsx**, **Pagination.tsx**, **TimelineSection.tsx**\n   - Other shared components (not currently used in SupplierTracker but available)\n\n#### **Shared Utilities**\n\n1. **currency.ts**\n   - `formatCurrency(amount, currency, locale)` - Format as \"$1,234.56\"\n   - `formatNumber(value, decimals, locale)` - Format with commas\n   - `parseCurrency(value)` - Parse currency string back to number\n\n2. **date.ts**\n   - `formatDate(date, locale, options)` - \"Oct 25, 2023\"\n   - `formatDateTime(date, locale)` - \"Oct 25, 2023, 2:30 PM\"\n   - `formatDateRange(start, end, locale)` - \"Oct 1, 2023 - Oct 31, 2023\"\n\n#### **Shared Store**\n\n**createAppStore({reducer, middleware})** - Factory function to create Redux store with standard configuration\n\n---\n\n### 9. KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\n\n#### **Auto-ID Generation**\n- Suppliers: PostgreSQL `gen_random_uuid()`\n- Orders: `PO-` prefix + count-based sequential ID: `PO-000001`, `PO-000002`, etc.\n- Other tables: UUID\n\n#### **Computed Fields**\n- **Suppliers:** `open_orders_count` and `open_orders_value` calculated by `/suppliers` endpoint via LEFT JOIN on orders\n- **Orders:** `supplier_name` added by endpoint via JOIN with suppliers table\n\n#### **Transaction-Like Behavior**\n- Creating an order automatically:\n  1. Inserts order record\n  2. Inserts all line items\n  3. Records \"created\" event in order_history\n- Modifying line items automatically:\n  1. Updates or deletes item\n  2. Recalculates order totals (subtotal, tax, total_cost)\n  3. Records event in order_history\n\n#### **File Storage**\n- Uses **UploadThing** API for file uploads\n- Stores file URLs in database\n- Supported in: supplier-documents, order-documents\n\n#### **Status/Badge Styling**\n- Dynamic CSS class based on status value: `.badge.badge--${status.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-')}`\n- CSS defines colors for each status variant\n\n---\n\n### 10.

NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT\n\n#### **What's Complete**\n- Dashboard page with all three sections\n- Supplier list with CRUD operations\n- Order creation with line items\n- Upcoming orders table with filtering\n- Database schema with all tables\n- All Netlify backend functions (CRUD operations)\n- Navigation structure\n- Styling system with responsive design\n\n#### **What Needs Implementation**\n- **SupplierDetailsPage:** supplier info display, comments section (using CommentsSection?), documents section (using DocumentsSection?), related orders list\n- **OrderDetailsPage:** order summary, line items section, documents section (using DocumentsSection?), history timeline (using TimelineSection?)\n- Some navigation may need refinement (currently all nav items go to \"/\" after clicking)\n- Potential auth integration (auth reducer available but unused)\n\n#### **Frontend Architecture**\n- Modern React 18 with hooks\n- Redux Toolkit for state management\n- Async thunks for API calls (no loading states in detail pages yet)\n- Type-safe with TypeScript\n- Responsive CSS Grid layouts\n- Modal-based forms for create operations\n\nThis is a well-structured supplier management application with a clean separation between frontend components, Redux state management, and serverless backend functions. All the foundational pieces are in place; the detail pages just need UI implementation."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a9633c3f2ac83b5dd (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 77144\ntool_uses: 36\nduration_ms: 93726</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"cbf8ac4e-9b35-4e39-9288-3cf4c6e509bf","uuid":"062914cf-7938-451f-95c6-a7f466b07477","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the /repo/apps/SupplierTracker directory thoroughly.

COMPONENTS & PAGES\n\n#### **TopNavBar.tsx**\n- Fixed header with logo (\"SupplyChain Pro\"), nav links, user avatar\n- Links: Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders, Inventory (all currently navigate to \"/\")\n- Active state based on pathname prefix matching\n- User menu button (placeholder, not functional)\n\n#### **DashboardPage.tsx** (Fully Implemented)\n- Fetches suppliers and orders on mount\n- Displays loading state while fetching\n- Renders: `<QuickActions />` → `<UpcomingOrdersTable />` → `<SuppliersList />`\n\n#### **QuickActions.tsx**\nTwo buttons with modal dialogs:\n\n**Button 1: \"Add New Supplier\"**\n- Modal form with fields:\n  - `name` (required, validated)\n  - `address` (textarea)\n  - `contact_name`\n  - `phone`\n  - `email`\n  - `description` (textarea)\n  - `status` (dropdown: Active/Inactive/On Hold/Suspended)\n- Calls `createSupplier()` + `fetchSuppliers()` on save\n- Form validation & error display\n\n**Button 2: \"Create Purchase Order\"**\n- Modal form with fields:\n  - `supplier_id` (required, SearchableSelect)\n  - `order_date` (date input, defaults to today)\n  - `expected_delivery` (date input, optional)\n  - Dynamic line items section:\n    - Grid columns: SKU | Item Name | Qty | Unit Price | Remove button\n    - Add/Remove buttons for line items (min 1 item)\n- Calls `createOrder()` + `fetchOrders()` on save\n\n#### **SuppliersList.tsx**\n- Responsive grid (4 cols → 3 → 2 → 1 on smaller screens)\n- Each card shows:\n  - Supplier name\n  - Status badge (dynamic color styling)\n  - Contact name\n  - Email\n  - \"X Open Orders, $Y Value\" (from `open_orders_count` and `open_orders_value`)\n- Clickable cards navigate to `/suppliers/:id`\n\n#### **UpcomingOrdersTable.tsx**\n- Section card with header and filters\n- Two filter dropdowns:\n  - Status filter (auto-populated from orders)\n  - Supplier filter (searchable)\n- Table with columns: Order ID, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, Total Cost\n- Order IDs are clickable links to `/orders/:orderId`\n- Status badges with dynamic colors\n- Currency formatted totals\n\n#### **SupplierDetailsPage.tsx** & **OrderDetailsPage.tsx**\n- Currently placeholders showing \"Loading...\"\n- Need full implementation with:\n  - SupplierDetailsPage: supplier info, comments section, documents section, open orders list\n  - OrderDetailsPage: order details, line items, documents, history timeline\n\n---\n\n### 7. STYLING SETUP\n\n#### **CSS Architecture**\n1. **Shared tokens** (`/repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css`):\n   - Color variables (accent-primary: #4d7c5e, status colors, text colors)\n   - Font families, shadows, sizing constants\n   - Dark theme variables (unused in SupplierTracker currently)\n\n2. **Global styles** (`src/index.css`):\n   - Imports shared tokens + layout + common\n   - App-specific status badge colors (supplier: active/inactive/on-hold/suspended)\n   - Order status colors (pending/in-transit/fulfilled/processing/completed/cancelled/approved/shipped/delivered)\n   - Reusable classes: `.badge`, `.section-card`, `.data-table`, `.btn-primary/.btn-secondary/.btn-ghost/.btn-danger`, `.form-*`, `.modal-*`, `.page-*`, etc.\n\n3. **Component-specific CSS**:\n   - `TopNavBar.css` - Header styles\n   - `QuickActions.css` - Modal and form layouts\n   - `SuppliersList.css` - Card grid responsive design\n   - `UpcomingOrdersTable.css` - Table styling\n\n#### **Design System**\n- **Accent Primary:** #4d7c5e (green)\n- **Text Primary:** #26231e (dark brown)\n- **Status Success:** #4d7c5e (green, Active/Fulfilled/Approved/Delivered)\n- **Status Warning:** #b08a3e (amber, On Hold/Pending/Processing)\n- **Status Error:** #b05050 (red, Suspended/Cancelled)\n- **Status Info:** #5a7a8a (blue, In Transit/Shipped)\n\n---\n\n### 8. SHARED COMPONENTS & UTILITIES\n\n#### **Shared Components** (`/repo/apps/shared/components/`)\n\n1. **SearchableSelect.tsx**\n   - Used for supplier selection in \"Create Order\" modal\n   - Props: `options` (id/label), `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `testId`\n   - Filters on text input with dropdown\n\n2. **FilterSelect.tsx**\n   - Used for status and supplier filters in UpcomingOrdersTable\n   - Props: `options` (value/label), `value`, `onChange`, `searchable`, `testId`\n   - Dropdown with optional search\n\n3. **Breadcrumb.tsx**, **CategorySection.tsx**, **CommentsSection.tsx**, **ConfirmDialog.tsx**, **DocumentsSection.tsx**, **ImportDialog.tsx**, **Pagination.tsx**, **TimelineSection.tsx**\n   - Other shared components (not currently used in SupplierTracker but available)\n\n#### **Shared Utilities**\n\n1. **currency.ts**\n   - `formatCurrency(amount, currency, locale)` - Format as \"$1,234.56\"\n   - `formatNumber(value, decimals, locale)` - Format with commas\n   - `parseCurrency(value)` - Parse currency string back to number\n\n2. **date.ts**\n   - `formatDate(date, locale, options)` - \"Oct 25, 2023\"\n   - `formatDateTime(date, locale)` - \"Oct 25, 2023, 2:30 PM\"\n   - `formatDateRange(start, end, locale)` - \"Oct 1, 2023 - Oct 31, 2023\"\n\n#### **Shared Store**\n\n**createAppStore({reducer, middleware})** - Factory function to create Redux store with standard configuration\n\n---\n\n### 9. KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\n\n#### **Auto-ID Generation**\n- Suppliers: PostgreSQL `gen_random_uuid()`\n- Orders: `PO-` prefix + count-based sequential ID: `PO-000001`, `PO-000002`, etc.\n- Other tables: UUID\n\n#### **Computed Fields**\n- **Suppliers:** `open_orders_count` and `open_orders_value` calculated by `/suppliers` endpoint via LEFT JOIN on orders\n- **Orders:** `supplier_name` added by endpoint via JOIN with suppliers table\n\n#### **Transaction-Like Behavior**\n- Creating an order automatically:\n  1. Inserts order record\n  2. Inserts all line items\n  3. Records \"created\" event in order_history\n- Modifying line items automatically:\n  1. Updates or deletes item\n  2. Recalculates order totals (subtotal, tax, total_cost)\n  3. Records event in order_history\n\n#### **File Storage**\n- Uses **UploadThing** API for file uploads\n- Stores file URLs in database\n- Supported in: supplier-documents, order-documents\n\n#### **Status/Badge Styling**\n- Dynamic CSS class based on status value: `.badge.badge--${status.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-')}`\n- CSS defines colors for each status variant\n\n---\n\n### 10. DEPENDENCIES\n\n**Key Libraries:**\n- `react` ^18.3.1\n- `react-dom` ^18.3.1\n- `react-router-dom` ^7.1.1 - Routing\n- `@reduxjs/toolkit` ^2.5.0 - State management\n- `react-redux` ^9.2.0 - React bindings\n- `@neondatabase/serverless` ^0.10.4 - PostgreSQL client\n- `uploadthing` ^7.7.4 - File upload service\n- `@netlify/functions` ^5.1.2 - Serverless function types\n- TypeScript ~5.7.2\n- Vite ^6.0.5 - Build tool\n- Playwright ^1.58.2 - E2E testing\n\n---\n\n### 11. TESTING\n\nLocated in `/repo/apps/SupplierTracker/tests/`:\n- `dashboard-quick-actions.spec.ts` - Tests for supplier/order creation modals\n- `dashboard-suppliers-list.spec.ts` - Tests for supplier grid display\n- `dashboard-upcoming-orders.spec.ts` - Tests for order table & filters\n- `deployment.spec.ts` - Deployment health checks\n\nTests use Playwright with Replay.io integration.\n\n---\n\n### 12. NOTES FOR DEVELOPMENT\n\n#### **What's Complete**\n- Dashboard page with all three sections\n- Supplier list with CRUD operations\n- Order creation with line items\n- Upcoming orders table with filtering\n- Database schema with all tables\n- All Netlify backend functions (CRUD operations)\n- Navigation structure\n- Styling system with responsive design\n\n#### **What Needs Implementation**\n- **SupplierDetailsPage:** supplier info display, comments section (using CommentsSection?), documents section (using DocumentsSection?), related orders list\n- **OrderDetailsPage:** order summary, line items section, documents section (using DocumentsSection?), history timeline (using TimelineSection?)\n- Some navigation may need refinement (currently all nav items go to \"/\" after clicking)\n- Potential auth integration (auth reducer available but unused)\n\n#### **Frontend Architecture**\n- Modern React 18 with hooks\n- Redux Toolkit for state management\n- Async thunks for API calls (no loading states in detail pages yet)\n- Type-safe with TypeScript\n- Responsive CSS Grid layouts\n- Modal-based forms for create operations\n\nThis is a well-structured supplier management application with a clean separation between frontend components, Redux state management, and serverless backend functions. All the foundational pieces are in place; the detail pages just need UI implementation."}],"totalDurationMs":93726,"totalTokens":77144,"totalToolUseCount":36,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2896,"cache_read_input_tokens":67664,"output_tokens":6580,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2896},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me plan and write all the components. I need to:\n\n1. **SupplierOverview** - Shows supplier info (name, address, contact, description, status), with Edit, Delete, and Back to Dashboard buttons\n2. **DocumentsTab** - Uses the shared DocumentsSection component adapted for supplier documents, with search and upload\n3. **CommentsSection** - Comments for supplier with add/collapse functionality\n4. **OrdersSection** - Tabs for upcoming/historical orders with search and status filter\n5. **SupplierDetailsPage** - The page that ties everything together\n\n\n6. **Breadcrumb navigation** - \"Home > Suppliers > <Supplier Name> > Supplier Details\"\n\nLet me verify the exact layout and styling requirements from the spec. The SupplierOverview needs a heading, supplier fields (name, address, contact, description), a status badge with a green indicator, and action buttons for editing and deleting. The page should display the breadcrumb at the top, followed by the overview section, then the three tabs for Documents, Comments, and Orders below it.\n\nFor the DocumentsTab, I need document cards showing the file name in bold, type and upload date as label/value pairs, plus view and download action icons. There's also a search field and an upload button.\n\nThe CommentsSection displays a collapsible header showing the comment count, lists comments in reverse chronological order with author and date, and includes an input field for adding new comments that persists after reload.\n\nThe OrdersSection has two tabs—one for upcoming orders and one for historical orders—each with their own table showing relevant columns like order ID, delivery/expected delivery dates, status, and cost information. I should also include search and status filtering capabilities with badge styling for the statuses.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the DocumentsSection implementation more closely to understand how the search, upload, and action functionality should work together. The shared DocumentsSection component has all the necessary callbacks and test IDs, but it renders as a table rather than cards, and its upload mechanism is just a simple file input without a document type field like the test spec requires. I need to decide whether to extend the shared component or build a custom implementation that matches the spec's card layout and upload dialog requirements. I need to create a custom DocumentsTab component with a card-based layout instead of using the shared table component, since the tests expect cards and a custom upload dialog that lets users specify the document type. I'll build this wrapper to handle the upload flow and maintain the test IDs the tests are looking for. I'm noticing the shared CommentsSection component doesn't match what the spec requires—it displays author, role, date, and text separately, but the spec wants them formatted as \"date - text - author\" in a single line. Plus it's missing the collapse/expand toggle functionality. I'll need to build a custom CommentsSection component specifically for this supplier details page that follows the spec exactly, along with separate files for SupplierOverview and DocumentsTab components. I need to decide between reusing the shared components with modifications or building standalone ones. Since the specs require specific behavior like collapse/expand for comments and different layouts, I'll create custom components to keep things clean. Now I'm writing the components in order: SupplierOverview with an edit modal, DocumentsTab, SupplierCommentsSection, OrdersSection, and finally updating the SupplierDetailsPage.
