Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8ad7049c-1643-463a-b992-f57b445688cd","uuid":"0052e043-925a-4e33-89fb-18882c9cf108","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

AppSpec.md (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md`)\n\nThe app is a Sales CRM for tracking client relationships and prospects. The **DealDetailPage** is page 5 at route `/deals/:dealId` with these sections:\n- **Header**: deal name, associated client, value, owner, current stage with controls to change stage\n- **Deal Stage / History**: visual pipeline indicator + chronological history of stage changes (old stage, new stage, date/time, user).

Existing Page Component Patterns\n\n### PersonDetailPage (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/PersonDetailPage.tsx`)\nPattern: Uses `useParams` to get `individualId`, fetches data with local `useState`/`useEffect` (not Redux), renders a loading state, not-found state, then the page content with composed child components:\n```tsx\n<div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\" data-testid=\"person-detail-page\">\n  <PersonHeader ... />\n  <RelationshipsSection individualId={individualId} />\n  <ContactHistorySection individualId={individualId} />\n  <AssociatedClientsSection individualId={individualId} />\n</div>\n```\n\n### TasksListPage (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TasksListPage.tsx`)\nPattern: Uses **Redux** (`useAppDispatch`, `fetchTasks()`), dispatches on mount via `useEffect`, renders composed components:\n```tsx\n<div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\" data-testid=\"tasks-list-page\">\n  <TasksHeader />\n  <div className=\"mb-4\"><TasksFilter /></div>\n  <TasksList />\n</div>\n```\n\n### ClientsListPage (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientsListPage.tsx`)\nPattern: Uses **Redux** with multiple selectors, re-fetches when filters change:\n```tsx\n<div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\" data-testid=\"clients-list-page\">\n  <div className=\"page-header\">\n    <h1 className=\"page-title\">Clients</h1>\n    <ClientsActions />\n  </div>\n  <ClientsSearchAndFilters />\n  <ClientsTable />\n  <Pagination />\n</div>\n```\n\n### ClientDetailPage (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientDetailPage.tsx`)\nPattern: Simple - fetches via local state, renders client name + tasks section. This is a minimal/partially-built page.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Existing Component Patterns\n\nKey patterns observed across all components:\n\n- **data-testid attributes**: Every interactive element and section has a `data-testid` attribute for Playwright testing\n- **CSS classes**: Use custom CSS classes defined in `index.css`, not Tailwind utility classes (except occasional `p-6`, `mb-4`, `mt-4`)\n- **Icons**: Use `lucide-react` (e.g., `MoreHorizontal`, `Eye`, `Pencil`, `Trash2`, `Plus`, `X`, `Search`, `ChevronDown`) or inline SVGs\n- **Modals**: Use `.modal-overlay` > `.modal-content` pattern with `onClick` stopPropagation\n- **Dropdowns**: Use `useRef` + click outside listener pattern with `useState` for open/close\n- **API calls**: Direct `fetch` to `/.netlify/functions/...` endpoints\n- **Loading states**: Simple `<p>Loading...</p>` or conditional rendering\n- **Empty states**: Custom `.person-section-empty` or `.clients-table-empty` divs\n- **Sections**: Use `.person-section` class (border, border-radius, padding) with `.person-section-header` containing heading + action buttons\n- **Forms**: `.modal-form` > `.form-field` > `.form-label` + `.form-input` pattern\n- **Buttons**: `.btn-primary` (accent blue), `.btn-secondary` (bordered), `.btn-ghost` (transparent), `.btn-danger` (red)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Redux Store Structure\n\n### Store (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/index.ts`)\n```typescript\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: {\n    clients: clientsReducer,\n    tasks: tasksReducer,\n  },\n})\nexport type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>\nexport type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch\n```\n\n### Hooks (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/hooks.ts`)\n```typescript\nexport const useAppDispatch = useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()\nexport const useAppSelector = useSelector.withTypes<RootState>()\n```\n\n### clientsSlice (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/clientsSlice.ts`)\n- State: `items`, `total`, `page`, `pageSize`, `loading`, `error`, `filters` (search, status, tag, source, sort), `availableTags`, `availableSources`\n- Async thunks: `fetchClients`, `createClient`, `updateClient`, `deleteClient`, `importClients`\n- Reducers: `setSearch`, `setStatusFilter`, `setTagFilter`, `setSourceFilter`, `setSort`, `setPage`\n\n### tasksSlice (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/tasksSlice.ts`)\n- State: `items` (TaskRow[]), `loading`, `error`, `filterType`, `filterText`, `clients`, `deals`, `assignees`\n- Async thunks: `fetchTasks`, `createTask`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`\n- Reducers: `setFilterType`, `setFilterText`\n- TaskRow interface: `id, title, description, client_id, deal_id, assignee, assignee_role, priority, completed, due_date, client_name, deal_name, created_at, updated_at`\n\n**Note**: There is NO `dealsSlice` yet. You will need to create one.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Netlify Functions (Backend API)\n\n### clients.ts (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts`)\n- GET `/clients` - List with filtering, pagination, sorting\n- GET `/clients/:id` - Single client with tags\n- POST `/clients` - Create\n- POST `/clients?action=import` - Bulk import\n- PUT `/clients/:id` - Update\n- DELETE `/clients/:id` - Delete\n\n### individuals.ts (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/individuals.ts`)\n- GET `/individuals/:id` - Single individual with associated_clients\n- GET `/individuals?search=` - List/search\n- GET `/individuals/:id/relationships` - Get relationships\n- POST `/individuals/:id/relationships` - Create relationship (with reciprocal)\n- DELETE `/individuals/:id/relationships/:relId` - Delete (with reciprocal)\n- GET `/individuals/:id/contact-history` - Get history\n- POST `/individuals/:id/contact-history` - Create entry\n- PUT `/individuals/:id/contact-history/:entryId` - Update entry\n- GET `/individuals/:id/clients` - Get associated clients\n\n### tasks.ts (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/tasks.ts`)\n- GET `/tasks` - List all (with optional `client_id` filter), joins with clients and deals\n- GET `/tasks/:id` - Single task\n- POST `/tasks` - Create\n- PUT `/tasks/:id` - Update\n- DELETE `/tasks/:id` - Delete\n\n**Note**: There is NO `deals.ts` Netlify function yet. You will need to create one.\n\nEach Netlify function follows the same pattern:\n- `neon()` SQL client from `@neondatabase/serverless`\n- CORS headers\n- `json()` helper for responses\n- Path segment parsing for resource IDs\n- HTTP method switch\n\n---\n\n## 9. Router Setup (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`)\n\n```tsx\n<Routes>\n  <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navigate to=\"/clients\" replace />} />\n  <Route path=\"/login\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Login\" />} />\n  <Route element={<AppLayout />}>\n    <Route path=\"/dashboard\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Dashboard\" />} />\n    <Route path=\"/clients\" element={<ClientsListPage />} />\n    <Route path=\"/clients/:clientId\" element={<ClientDetailPage />} />\n    <Route path=\"/individuals/:individualId\" element={<PersonDetailPage />} />\n    <Route path=\"/deals\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Deals\" />} />\n    <Route path=\"/deals/:dealId\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Deal Detail\" />} />\n    <Route path=\"/tasks\" element={<TasksListPage />} />\n    <Route path=\"/reports\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Reports\" />} />\n    <Route path=\"/settings\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Settings\" />} />\n  </Route>\n</Routes>\n```\n\nThe `/deals/:dealId` route currently renders a **PlaceholderPage** -- this is what needs to be replaced with DealDetailPage.\n\nThe `AppLayout` uses Sidebar + `<Outlet />` in a flex layout.\n\n---\n\n## 10. CSS Files\n\n### index.css (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css`) - 1757 lines\nContains **all** application styles using CSS custom properties defined in a `@theme` block (Tailwind v4).

Router Setup (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`)\n\n```tsx\n<Routes>\n  <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navigate to=\"/clients\" replace />} />\n  <Route path=\"/login\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Login\" />} />\n  <Route element={<AppLayout />}>\n    <Route path=\"/dashboard\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Dashboard\" />} />\n    <Route path=\"/clients\" element={<ClientsListPage />} />\n    <Route path=\"/clients/:clientId\" element={<ClientDetailPage />} />\n    <Route path=\"/individuals/:individualId\" element={<PersonDetailPage />} />\n    <Route path=\"/deals\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Deals\" />} />\n    <Route path=\"/deals/:dealId\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Deal Detail\" />} />\n    <Route path=\"/tasks\" element={<TasksListPage />} />\n    <Route path=\"/reports\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Reports\" />} />\n    <Route path=\"/settings\" element={<PlaceholderPage name=\"Settings\" />} />\n  </Route>\n</Routes>\n```\n\nThe `/deals/:dealId` route currently renders a **PlaceholderPage** -- this is what needs to be replaced with DealDetailPage.\n\nThe `AppLayout` uses Sidebar + `<Outlet />` in a flex layout.\n\n---\n\n## 10.

Update App.tsx to wire up the route\n\nLet me create the todo list and start building.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8529,"cache_read_input_tokens":63206,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8529,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8ad7049c-1643-463a-b992-f57b445688cd","uuid":"a0445197-00e1-4170-8f9a-21598657d271"}
