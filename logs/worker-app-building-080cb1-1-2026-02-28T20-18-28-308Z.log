No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders.

Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks.

If it exists, you MUST populate `.env` with the existing resource IDs so\nthe script reuses them. See `skills/scripts/deploy.md` § \"Populating `.env` for\nRedeployments\" for the exact steps.\n\nThen run `npm run deploy` from the app directory. See `skills/scripts/deploy.md` for the\nfull script specification. The script handles database creation/sync, Netlify site\ncreation/update, and writes the deployed URL to `deployment.txt`.\n\nAfter a successful deployment, you MUST append a deployment history entry to the end of\n`deployment.txt`. The entry must include the date and a summary of what changed:\n\n```\n--- Deployment 2026-02-26 ---\nChanges:\n- Added user authentication flow\n- Fixed pagination bug on accounts page\n- Updated dashboard layout to match mockup\n```\n\nUse `git log` to determine what changed since the last deployment. If `deployment.txt`\nalready has history entries, compare against the most recent one. If this is the first\ndeployment, summarize the initial feature set.\n\n## Testing\n\nAfter deploying, you MUST perform a functional test to verify the app actually works in production.\nA deployment that serves HTTP 200 is not sufficient — the app must display real data and support updates.\nThe deployment test lives at `tests/deployment.spec.ts`, separate from the integration tests.\nIt must be excluded from regular `npm run test` runs by adding it to `testIgnore` in\n`playwright.config.ts`:\n\n```ts\ntestIgnore: ['**/deployment.spec.ts'],\n```\n\nThe deployment test has its own config at `playwright.deployment.config.ts` which uses\n`@replayio/playwright` to launch the Replay browser and auto-upload recordings.\nAll browsers must run headless — never use Xvfb or set `DISPLAY`.\n\n```\nnpx playwright test --config playwright.deployment.config.ts\n```\n\n### Functional Test Requirements\n\nThe functional test must verify:\n1. **Data displays**: Navigate to the main page and confirm that real data (e.g. client records) loads and renders visibly.\n2. **Data can be updated**: Perform a write operation (e.g. add or edit a record) and confirm the change persists.\n\nIf either check fails, the deployment is broken and must be investigated and fixed before marking the task complete.\n\n### Recording with Replay\n\nAll functional tests MUST be recorded using the Replay Playwright integration so that\nthe Replay browser is used to launch and interact with the deployed page, and failures\ncan be debugged from the recording.\n\nThe deployment test is a SINGLE Playwright test at `tests/deployment.spec.ts` that\nruns against the deployed production URL (read from `deployment.txt`). It uses a\nseparate config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) that launches the Replay browser\nvia `@replayio/playwright` and auto-uploads recordings. It does not start a dev server\nor reuse the integration test config.\n\n#### Analyzing the Recording\n\nAfter the test runs and the recording is uploaded, use Replay MCP tools to analyze\nthe recording and verify the app works correctly. If the test fails, use the recording\nto diagnose the root cause before attempting a fix.\n\nA deployment is only complete when the Replay recording confirms that the app displays data and\nsupports updates. Record the Replay recording ID in the deployment notes.\n\nRead these skills to learn how to use these:\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-playwright/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-mcp/SKILL.md\n\n## Tips\n\n- Do NOT use the `replayio record <url>` CLI to create recordings. It launches a headed browser\n  which will crash in this headless container (`Missing X server or $DISPLAY`). Always use the\n  Playwright deployment test config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) which runs headless with\n  `@replayio/playwright` and handles browser setup correctly.\n- Do NOT install or start Xvfb. All browsers must run headless. If a browser complains about\n  a missing display, the fix is to ensure it runs headless, not to add a virtual display.\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for verifying the deployment. If the\n  upload is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT decide you have \"enough information\"\n  and proceed without the recording — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis cycle.\n","numLines":107,"startLine":1,"totalLines":107}}}
