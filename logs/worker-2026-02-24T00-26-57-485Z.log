Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root.

Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9358be0e-1d5d-4025-8e62-a8c8aedcc7f4","uuid":"236c9eb9-53df-42e2-aa9f-dda3ad7b3434","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01Y577ScU6v941jfcV4TkgzA","session_id":"9358be0e-1d5d-4025-8e62-a8c8aedcc7f4","uuid":"06841cbc-edb6-43a5-8a5d-454e442d2e74"}

Let me provide you with a detailed summary of all the files:\n\n## Complete Code Pattern Reference\n\n### 1. **Redux Store Setup** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/index.ts`)\n- Uses Redux Toolkit with `configureStore`\n- Multiple slices: auth, clients, deals, tasks, individuals, users\n- Type exports for RootState and AppDispatch\n\n### 2. **Custom Hooks** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/hooks.ts`)\n- `useAppDispatch()` - typed dispatch hook\n- `useAppSelector()` - typed selector hook\n\n### 3. **App Structure** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`)\n- Uses React Router v7 with Routes\n- Sidebar component + main content area layout\n- Routes for: clients, contacts, deals, tasks, users, settings, auth pages\n\n### 4. **Styling** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css`)\n- Tailwind CSS with custom theme variables in `:root`\n- Color variables for status (active, inactive, prospect, churned)\n- Priority colors (high, medium, low)\n- Deal stage colors (lead, qualified, proposal, negotiation, closed-won, closed-lost)\n- Responsive typography and spacing\n\n### 5. **Redux Slice Pattern** (e.g., `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/slices/dealsSlice.ts`)\n```typescript\n// Structure:\n- Interface for item (Deal, Client, Task, etc.)\n- State interface with: items[], current, loading, error, search/filters, sortBy/sortDir, page, total\n- AsyncThunk for fetching (uses URLSearchParams with filters)\n- Slice with reducers for: setSearch, setFilter*, setSortBy, setPage, clearCurrent\n- Extra reducers for pending/fulfilled/rejected states\n```\n\n### 6. **Netlify Function Pattern** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/auth.ts`)\n- Uses Netlify Functions with `Context` parameter\n- Neon PostgreSQL via `@neondatabase/serverless`\n- JWT tokens with jsonwebtoken library\n- Pattern: Check method, validate inputs, query DB, return JSON responses\n- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes\n\n### 7. **Page Components** (e.g., `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealsListPage.tsx`)\n- Simple stub pages with `data-testid` attributes\n- Basic layout: `<div className=\"p-6 max-sm:p-3\">` container\n- Heading with `text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--color-text-primary)]`\n\n### 8. **Authentication Pages**\n- **ForgotPasswordPage** - Form with email input, calls `/auth` function with action\n- **ResetPasswordPage** - Form with password fields, validates match, calls auth function\n- **ConfirmEmailPage** - Auto-confirms on mount via token parameter\n\n### 9. **Sidebar Components** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/`)\n- **Sidebar.tsx** - Container with navigation and user area\n- **SidebarNavLinks.tsx** - Navigation items using lucide-react icons, active state styling\n- **SidebarUserArea.tsx** - Shows user info or auth form, handles sign in/up/out\n\n### 10. **Utility Patterns** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/lib/utils.ts`)\n- `cn()` - Tailwind class merging with clsx\n- `formatCurrency()` - Intl.NumberFormat for USD\n- `formatDate()` and `formatDateTime()` - Intl.DateTimeFormat\n- `getInitials()` - Extract 2 initials from name\n- `getAuthHeader()` - Get Bearer token from localStorage\n\n### 11. **Redux Slices Included**\n- **dealsSlice** - Filters: stage, client, status; sorting; view mode (table/pipeline)\n- **clientsSlice** - Filters: status, tags; sorting\n- **tasksSlice** - Filters: priority, status; sorting\n- **individualsSlice** - Basic search and pagination\n- **authSlice** - signIn, signUp, loadSession, signOut\n- **usersSlice** - Fetch users list\n\n### 12. **Main Entry** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx`)\n- Redux Provider wrapping BrowserRouter\n- Strict Mode enabled\n\n### 13. **HTML Structure** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/index.html`)\n- Standard structure with root div for React mounting\n- Module script loading main.tsx\n\n### 14. **Configuration Files**\n- **vite.config.ts** - React + Tailwind plugins, path alias for @/, sourcemap enabled\n- **package.json** - Dependencies: Redux Toolkit, React, TailwindCSS, React Router, Netlify Functions\n- **tsconfig** - Referenced configs for app and node\n\n### 15. **Key Styling Patterns**\n- Tailwind + custom CSS variables\n- Responsive: `max-sm:p-3` breakpoint pattern\n- Text sizes: `text-[13px]`, `text-[11px]`\n- Height units: `h-7`, `h-8`, `h-6`\n- Color references: `var(--color-text-primary)`, `var(--color-accent)`, etc.\n- Flex layouts with gap spacing: `gap-2`, `gap-3`\n- Rounded corners: `rounded`\n\nAll files are now documented and ready for reference when building new features!"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a371233abb2fcf9a1 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 50399\ntool_uses: 58\nduration_ms: 43991</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9358be0e-1d5d-4025-8e62-a8c8aedcc7f4","uuid":"254dc369-c071-4d5a-8ad9-b4a6d9e2a5dc","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Read these files and return their full contents so I can understand existing code patterns:\n1. /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/store.ts\n2. /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx\n3. /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css\n4.

The outer container (`.ezxFuW`) is a single-column grid where each child is a full-width row.\n\n```css\n/* Outer list container */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* single column, full-width rows */\ngrid-template-rows: 36px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 308px;\n                  /* ^group header  ^issue rows...                              ^spacer */\n```\n\n- **Group header row**: 36px tall\n- **Issue row**: 44px tall\n- The list container has 14 children: 1 group header + 12 issue rows + 1 spacer\n\n### Issue Row Structure\n\nEach issue row is an `<a>` tag (the full row is clickable) wrapping an inner grid `<div>` with **7 named grid columns**:\n\n| Column       | Content Example          | Font Size | Font Weight | Color             |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `checkbox`   | (empty/checkbox)         | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `priority`   | (priority icon)          | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `identifier` | \"PRO-1247\", \"TT-38\"     | 13px      | 450         | rgb(91, 91, 93)   |\n| `status`     | (status icon)            | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `title`      | \"Contact form not working\" | 13px    | 500         | rgb(26, 26, 26)   |\n| `created`    | (date/avatar info)       | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n| (additional) | (assignee, labels, etc.) | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n\nKey observations:\n- **Identifier** uses muted color `rgb(91, 91, 93)` / `#5b5b5d` with semi-bold weight 450\n- **Title** uses primary color `rgb(26, 26, 26)` / `#1a1a1a` with medium weight 500\n- Both use 13px font size (not the body 16px)\n- The grid uses **named column tracks** (`checkbox`, `priority`, `identifier`, `status`, `title`, `created`) for semantic column placement\n\n### Issue Row Styling\n\n```css\n/* Issue row (A tag) */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-column: 1 / -1;      /* spans full width */\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 44px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nborder: none;              /* 0px none — no visible row borders */\ncursor: default;\ntext-decoration: none;     /* no underline on the link */\noutline: none;             /* focus-visible override */\n```\n\n### Row Separation\n\nRows have **no visible borders** between them. Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nfont-size: 16px;\nfont-weight: 400;\n```\n\nGroup headers contain section names (e.g., \"Other active\") with a count badge (\"19\").\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —         |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`  | ~6% black |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(239, 239, 239)`     | `#efefef` |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(245, 245, 245)`     | `#f5f5f5` |\n| Alt hover (mid)   | `rgb(247, 247, 247)`     | `#f7f7f7` |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(237, 237, 237)`     | `#ededed` |\n\nAll hover backgrounds observed in stylesheets:\n- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)` — primary interactive hover\n- `rgb(239, 239, 239)` — pressed/active\n- `rgb(245, 245, 245)` — sidebar hover\n- `rgb(247, 247, 247)` — light hover\n- `rgb(237, 237, 237)` — selected state\n- `transparent` — reset/clear hover\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: var(--control-border-radius, 4px);\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(45, 46, 47);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background         | Description                |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Default | transparent        | No background              |\n| Hover   | rgb(247, 247, 247) | `#f7f7f7` — subtle gray    |\n| Active  | rgb(238, 238, 238) | `#eeeeee` — slightly darker|\n\nThe hover transition uses `var(--speed-highlightFadeIn)` for a fast, smooth appearance.\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n| `1px solid var(--gray4)`             | Subtle separators        |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#dcdcdc`.\nHover border uses `var(--normal-border-hover)` and `var(--gray5)` for a slightly darker state.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value                              | Usage                     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| `var(--control-border-radius)` 4px | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px                                | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px                                | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%                                | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows are very subtle and use low-opacity black.

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes.

Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9358be0e-1d5d-4025-8e62-a8c8aedcc7f4","uuid":"5c96a324-f317-4e7a-af16-bae3f6339fce","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional.

A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link.

Let me look at the mockup image to understand the visual layout. Let me also check if there are any existing components I missed.\n\nThe explore agent didn't find any existing components beyond Sidebar. So I need to build everything from scratch. Let me also check the tasks schema more carefully.\n\nKey things I need:\n1. The tasks table has: id, title, description, due_date (DATE), priority (high/medium/low), status (open/completed/cancelled), client_id, deal_id, assignee_id\n2. The test spec mentions \"Normal\" priority but the schema only has high/medium/low. I need to add \"normal\" to the schema.\n\n\n3. I need to update the priority enum in the schema and the tasksSlice to include 'normal', and I'll need to handle the assignee display since the users table doesn't have a role field but the mockup shows roles like \"PM\" and \"Sales\" next to names.\n\nLet me add a migration to create the role column on users, then I can map that data when displaying assignees. Now I'm mapping out all the files I need to create: the backend tasks endpoint with full CRUD and filtering, the filter bar component, the task card component with priority badges and assignee info...\n\nBuilding out the component structure...\n\nI also need to create a reusable FilterSelect component for the dropdowns and update the tasksSlice to default the status filter to 'open' instead of an empty string, since the test expects open tasks to show by default. I should also add 'normal' as a priority option to the Task interface.\n\nNow I'm planning the implementation order: backend function first, then update the Redux slice with the new defaults and priority type, followed by building out the components and finally the page. I also need to update the database schema to include 'normal' in the priority constraint, though I'll need to handle that carefully since modifying CHECK constraints requires dropping and recreating the table. a migration to handle that. I need to update the schema for new deployments and create a migration for existing ones to add 'normal' to the priority constraint. I should also add a 'role' field to the users table with its own migration. Now let me review the test spec details for the TaskCard component to understand the exact layout and styling requirements.\n\nLooking at the filter bar, create modal, and list content structure, I can see I need a search input, multiple dropdown filters, and a modal form with various fields. The revisions specifically mention a searchable FilterSelect component that should be reusable across the interface, so I'll create that as a shared component rather than duplicating the logic.\n\nNow I'm ready to start building everything—I'll work through the backend setup first, then the FilterSelect component, followed by the task-specific components and the main page. But I'm noticing the schema has `due_date` as just a DATE type, while the test spec shows times like \"Today, 5:00 PM\", so I need to change that to TIMESTAMPTZ to support datetime values and add a migration for it. Writing the implementation now...\n\nI need to design the backend API endpoints carefully—GET /tasks will handle filtering by search, priority, and status with pagination, returning both the task list and total count. I'll also need to set up the CSS variables for the normal priority color and make sure all the components wire together properly. I'm debating whether to use a query parameter like `?format=csv` or handle it differently. Looking at the test requirements, I need both CSV export (GET request that downloads a file) and CSV import (dialog that uploads). Let me settle on using `?export=csv` for the export endpoint and keep POST /tasks for both single creation and bulk imports with a flag to distinguish them.\n\nNow I'm realizing Netlify Functions route based on function names, so my `tasks.ts` function handles both the base path and any nested routes like `:id`. According to the path parsing strategy, the function name appears at index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 in the path structure.\n\nFor the `/tasks/import` endpoint, that would show up as 'import' at index 3, so I can differentiate between that and actual IDs by checking if it's a UUID or a known action like 'import'. Let me start implementing all the files now.\n\nActually, I need to check the users table schema first—there's no `role` field currently, so I'll need to add that column to the database and update the Task interface to include assignee name and role information for the frontend to display properly. I'm checking the existing priority color variables in the stylesheet and need to add a new teal color for the normal priority level, then I'll start implementing the code changes beginning with the schema updates. I'm realizing the due_date column needs to store times, not just dates, so I should switch from DATE to TIMESTAMPTZ in the schema and add a migration to convert existing data. For the CSV import, I need to handle the expected columns (Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee) and look up clients and users by name, plus I should clarify what the CSV template download should contain.\n\nNow I'm mapping out all the files I need to create and modify: updating the schema to add the 'normal' priority and TIMESTAMPTZ type, adjusting the CSS for the new priority color, modifying the tasks slice to include the 'normal' priority and assignee fields, then building out the backend function and several new UI components for filtering and displaying tasks.\n\nI'm starting with the backend SQL queries to fetch task lists with related client and deal information.\n\nNow I'm thinking through how to handle dynamic WHERE clauses with Neon's tagged template literals—I can't easily compose conditions directly, so I need to figure out a pattern that works with the strategy's requirement for composable fragments. Building the query with optional filters...\n\nFor the sorting, I need to handle dynamic column names safely since they can't be parameterized directly in SQL. I'll create a whitelist of valid columns and map the sort parameter to the appropriate table-qualified column name, defaulting to due_date if an invalid sort option is provided. I'm realizing the separate branches approach gets unwieldy fast. Instead, I can construct the ORDER BY clause dynamically using CASE expressions that handle both the column selection and sort direction, letting me keep a single query template while still supporting different sort options. The NULL values from unmatched conditions mean only the relevant sort column actually applies, with due date as a final tiebreaker. I'm adding server-side validation to sanitize the sort parameters and prevent injection attacks, then I'll move on to implementing the actual code. I also need to plan out the CSV export and import formats based on the test requirements.\n\nLooking at the schema more carefully, I need to change the due_date column from DATE to TIMESTAMPTZ since the tests reference specific times like \"5:00 PM\". I also notice the priority enum is missing 'normal' — the spec shows High, Medium, Normal, and Low as options, but the current constraint only allows high, medium, and low, so I'll need to add that and create a migration.\n\nThe tasksSlice TypeScript types also need updating to include 'normal' as a valid priority value.\n\nNow I'm going to start writing the code systematically. I'll batch the changes: first updating the existing files like schema.ts, index.css, and tasksSlice.ts to fix the priority and timestamp issues, then creating the new backend function and frontend components for the tasks feature.\n\nFor the schema migrations, I need to alter the tasks table to use TIMESTAMPTZ for due dates instead of DATE, update the priority constraint to include 'normal', and add a role column to the users table. Now I'm setting up the database migrations to convert the due_date column to TIMESTAMPTZ, update the priority constraint to include 'normal', and add the role column to users. Then I need to update the tasksSlice type definitions to reflect the new priority options.\n\nFor the styling, I'm adding CSS variables for the normal priority level, and I'll need to create a utility function that formats due dates with relative labels like \"Today\" and \"Tomorrow\".\n\nLet me start writing out all these changes, organizing the file edits first before moving to the new code.\n\nActually, I should double-check the test specifications since I can't access the mockup image directly—those specs will guide the exact formatting requirements. For the date formatting function, I'm thinking it should return just the date portion while the card template handles the \"Due:\" prefix, so the function stays flexible.\n\nWriting the date formatting helper... I've got a clear plan for implementing all the files needed. Now I'm thinking through the FilterSelect component—it needs a trigger button displaying the current selection, a dropdown menu with searchable options, and a clean onChange callback to handle updates.\n\nI'm also realizing I should create a shared ImportDialog component since the test spec mentions CSV import functionality and the docs indicate it's used across all entity types. Let me check what I've already planned before diving into that implementation. Looking at the dependency chain, I can batch these writes efficiently—starting with the independent foundational files like schema and utilities, then moving through components that build on each other, and finally assembling the page-level component that ties everything together.\n\nNow I'm being careful about the schema changes—I need to update the tasks table to use TIMESTAMPTZ for due dates and add 'normal' as a priority option, plus add a role field to the users table and handle the migration properly.\n\nWriting the migration logic...\n\nNow I'm adding the CSS variables for the normal priority level with its corresponding background color. Then I need to update the tasksSlice to include 'normal' as a valid priority option and add the assignee_avatar field. I'm reconsidering the approach to make the edits more efficient—rather than doing them piecemeal, I should batch the changes by file to avoid conflicts. Let me organize the tool calls sequentially, handling all edits to schema.ts together, then tasksSlice.ts, then the styling, so each file gets modified once with all its changes at once. I'm realizing the adjacent lines in schema.ts should be combined into a single edit to avoid conflicts. Let me group the due_date and priority changes together, then handle the users role and migrations separately. For the other files, I'll queue up edits for the priority type in tasksSlice.ts, the assignee fields, filterStatus, the normal priority in index.css, and the formatDueDate utility function. Adding migration logic for the priority constraint and role column...\n\nNow I'm reviewing the CSV export requirements to understand what fields need to be included in the download.\n\nFor the import flow, I need to set up backend endpoints that handle CSV parsing and bulk task creation, plus a reusable ImportDialog component that can work across different entity types by accepting a column spec and import callback.\n\nNow I'm ready to start implementing—I'll organize this into three batches: first updating existing files, then building the backend and shared components, and finally the tasks-specific pieces. Let me begin with the backend function that handles database connections and request routing...\n\nWriting backend handler... Setting up the REST API handlers for different HTTP methods—GET for fetching and exporting tasks, POST for creating or bulk importing, PUT for updates, and DELETE for removals, each with appropriate validation. Now I'm working through the SQL query optimization, particularly handling dynamic sorting with CASE statements to manage different sort directions efficiently. I'm realizing the complex CASE statement approach is overkill for what I need right now—the tests don't actually require sorting functionality, just filtering and pagination. Let me simplify this to support basic ordering with due_date as the default, then move on to actually building the component instead of planning it out further.\n\nNow I'm checking what test IDs the component needs to match the test expectations, going through the spec to identify all the required data-testid attributes for the filter bar, search input, dropdowns, and individual task cards. I'm mapping out the remaining test identifiers for the task management interface—the form fields for creating tasks, the list container with its loading and empty states, pagination controls, and the import/export functionality for CSV operations.\n\nNow I'm ready to implement these changes by adding the test IDs to the actual components.\n\nAdding test IDs to

The dialog shows a success message with the count of tasks imported. After closing the dialog, the task list refreshes and the newly imported tasks appear in the list. Client names in the CSV are matched to existing clients in the system.\n   281→\n   282→#### CSV import shows validation errors for invalid data\n   283→- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open. User has a CSV file with invalid data (e.g., missing required Title column, invalid priority value).\n   284→- **Action:** User uploads the invalid CSV file and confirms the import.\n   285→- **Expected:** The dialog displays per-row validation errors indicating which rows failed and why (e.g., \"Row 3: Title is required\", \"Row 5: Invalid priority 'Urgent'\"). Valid rows may still be imported, or the user may be asked to fix errors and retry. The error messages are specific enough for the user to correct the CSV.\n   286→\n   287→## TaskDetailPage (/tasks/:taskId)\n   288→\n   289→## ContactsListPage (/contacts)\n   290→\n   291→## SettingsPage (/settings)\n   292→\n   293→## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n   294→\n   295→## UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n   296→\n   297→## ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n   298→\n   299→## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n   300→\n   301→## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n   302→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01M5CX1y26RrNe91zf3sXe3d","session_id":"9358be0e-1d5d-4025-8e62-a8c8aedcc7f4","uuid":"192ef05c-88d5-49e0-8c2d-7024260fe1bd"}
