You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me analyze what needs to be done for the BatchDetailPage responsive work:\n\n**BatchDetailPage.tsx** - mostly done already:\n- `p-6 max-sm:p-3` ✓\n- `grid grid-cols-2 max-md:grid-cols-1 gap-6` ✓\n- `style={{ marginTop: 24 }}` should be `mt-6` for consistency\n\n**BatchHeader.tsx** - mostly responsive already:\n- Button text has `max-sm:hidden` ✓\n- Metadata rows use `flexWrap: \"wrap\"` ✓\n\n\n- The page title and header already handle responsive sizing through existing CSS classes ✓\n\n**BatchOverview.tsx**: The section heading is appropriately sized as-is, the card padding is already responsive through media queries, and I need to check the PropertyRow component next.\n\n**LineageSection.tsx**: The lineage diagram wraps correctly, but the fixed min-widths on nodes (200px in CSS, 160px inline) will cause horizontal scrolling on narrow screens and need to be made responsive.\n\n**UsageHistoryTable.tsx**: Column visibility is already handled with responsive classes, and I'm checking the card component next.\n\nLooking at the main issues to address: I need to convert inline margin styles to Tailwind classes in BatchDetailPage, reduce the PropertyRow label width constraints in BatchOverview for mobile, and add media queries to handle the lineage node widths on narrow viewports. BatchHeader seems mostly fine already.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":13874,"cache_read_input_tokens":40597,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":13874,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bc7d1080-395a-4203-bea1-6115720d43ac","uuid":"2d251bfd-cd2c-428c-b5dc-dfce7fe0ab56"}
