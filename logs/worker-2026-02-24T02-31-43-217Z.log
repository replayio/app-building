See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019K7926DoVuZ1ssboFACZMT","session_id":"9e0d087a-3036-498b-84b6-f473ae18636f","uuid":"83e02fb6-e089-4c2f-857f-8265f45e8eba"}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9e0d087a-3036-498b-84b6-f473ae18636f","uuid":"a345da7c-10df-46f0-9bae-05d93e94f89a","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

Let me plan the PersonDetailPage based on the mockup and spec:\n\nFrom the mockup, the PersonDetailPage has these sections:\n1. **PersonHeader** - Name (Dr. Anya Sharma), Title (Chief Technology Officer (CTO)), Associated organizations (Innovate Solutions Inc. & FutureTech Corp.), Email, Phone, Location, Associated Clients links\n2. **PersonRelationships** - \"Relationships with Other Individuals\" section with Graph View / List View tabs, relationship entries showing name, type, organization, and link. Has Filter and + Add Entry buttons\n\n\n3. **PersonContactHistory** - \"History of Contact\" section with date/time, type (Video Call, Email, Meeting, Note), summary, team member, and edit icon. Has Filter and + Add Entry buttons\n4. **PersonAssociatedClients** - \"Associated Clients\" section with cards showing client name, status, industry, and \"View Client Detail Page\" link\n\nNow I'm going to write out the test entries and draft the PersonDetailPage component with all these sections, starting with the PersonHeader structure.\n\nLooking at the mockup, the header displays Dr. Anya Sharma's name prominently, followed by her title spanning two companies, contact details with icons for email and phone, location information, and associated clients as clickable links. Below that is a Relationships section with tabs for Graph and List views, filtering options, and an entry list showing colleagues and decision makers with their roles and affiliated companies.\n\nNow

Other links have the default transparent background.\n\n#### Active link updates on sub-routes\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /clients/123 (a client detail page).\n- **Expected:** The \"Clients\" link in the sidebar is highlighted as the active link, since the route is a sub-route of /clients.\n\n#### Sidebar is persistent across all pages\n- **Initial state:** User navigates between different pages (Clients, Deals, Tasks, etc.).\n- **Expected:** The sidebar remains visible and in the same position on every page. The sidebar width is consistent (approximately 244px). Navigation links remain functional throughout.\n\n### SidebarUserArea\n\n#### Sign In button shown when not logged in\n- **Initial state:** User is not authenticated (no active session).\n- **Expected:** The sidebar user area (below the app title) displays a \"Sign In\" button. No avatar, user name, or sign-out option is visible.\n\n#### Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form\n- **Initial state:** User is not authenticated. The \"Sign In\" button is visible in the sidebar.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Sign In\" button.\n- **Expected:** An inline authentication form appears in the sidebar with: an email input field, a password input field, a \"Sign In\" submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch to \"Sign Up\" mode.

A message is displayed informing the user that a confirmation email has been sent and they must confirm their email before logging in. The user is not yet authenticated. (In test mode with IS_TEST=true, signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.)\n\n#### Logged in state shows avatar, name, and sign-out\n- **Initial state:** User is authenticated with an active session.\n- **Expected:** The sidebar user area displays the user's avatar (or initials), the user's display name, and a sign-out button or icon.

The badge text matches the client's current status.\n\n#### Table rows display tags as badges\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients that have tags assigned.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the client's tags as comma-separated badges in the Tags column (e.g., \"SaaS, Enterprise, Q3-Target\" for Acme Corp; \"Legacy, Partner\" for Globex Solutions). Clients with no tags show an empty cell or placeholder.\n\n#### Table rows display primary contact with name and title\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with organization clients that have associated contacts.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the primary contact's name followed by their title in parentheses in the Primary Contact column (e.g., \"Sarah Jenkins (CEO)\" for Acme Corp, \"Michael Chen (CTO)\" for Globex Solutions). For individual-type clients, the primary contact shows the client's own name with \"(Self)\" (e.g., \"Jane Doe (Self)\"). Clients with no primary contact show an empty cell or placeholder.\n\n#### Table rows display open deals count with total value\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients that have deals.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the number of open deals and their total value in the Open Deals column (e.g., \"3 (Value: $150k)\" for Acme Corp, \"1 (Value: $15k)\" for Jane Doe). Clients with no open deals show \"0\". The value is formatted with appropriate abbreviations (k for thousands, M for millions). Clients with deals but zero value show just the count (e.g., \"N/A\" for churned clients with no deals).\n\n#### Table rows display next task with description and date\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients that have upcoming tasks.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the next upcoming task description and its due date in the Next Task column (e.g., \"Follow-up call - Today, 2pm\" for Acme Corp, \"Send proposal - Tomorrow\" for Jane Doe, \"Review contract - Next Week\" for Stark Industries). Clients with no upcoming tasks show \"No task scheduled\". Dates for today and tomorrow show relative labels with time.\n\n#### Clicking a client row navigates to ClientDetailPage\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients.\n- **Action:** User clicks on a client row (e.g., the row for \"Acme Corp\" with client id 1).\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /clients/1 and the ClientDetailPage is displayed showing the full details for that client.\n\n#### Clicking an individual client row navigates to ClientDetailPage\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with individual-type clients.\n- **Action:** User clicks on an individual client row (e.g., the row for \"Jane Doe\" with client id 3).\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /clients/3 and the ClientDetailPage is displayed showing the full details for that individual client.\n\n#### Action menu icon displayed on each row\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients.\n- **Expected:** Each table row has a three-dot menu icon (\"...\") on the far right side. The icon is visible and clickable.\n\n#### Action menu shows options on click\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients.\n- **Action:** User clicks the three-dot menu icon (\"...\") on a client row.\n- **Expected:** A dropdown menu appears with options including: \"View Details\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\". The menu is positioned near the three-dot icon.\n\n#### Action menu View Details navigates to ClientDetailPage\n- **Initial state:** The three-dot action menu is open on a client row (e.g., client id 2).\n- **Action:** User clicks \"View Details\" from the action menu.\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /clients/2 and the ClientDetailPage is displayed.\n\n#### Action menu Edit opens edit functionality\n- **Initial state:** The three-dot action menu is open on a client row.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Edit\" from the action menu.\n- **Expected:** An edit modal or inline edit mode opens, allowing the user to modify the client's details (name, type, status, tags, source info). The current client data is pre-populated in the form fields.\n\n#### Action menu Delete removes the client with confirmation\n- **Initial state:** The three-dot action menu is open on a client row.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Delete\" from the action menu.\n- **Expected:** A confirmation dialog appears asking the user to confirm deletion (e.g., \"Are you sure you want to delete this client?\"). Upon confirmation, the client is deleted via the API and the row is removed from the table. The total client count decreases by one.\n\n#### Action menu Delete cancellation keeps the client\n- **Initial state:** The delete confirmation dialog is open for a client.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Cancel\" on the confirmation dialog.\n- **Expected:** The dialog closes. The client remains in the table unchanged.\n\n### ClientsSearchAndFilters\n\n#### Search input filters clients by name\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with multiple clients visible (e.g., \"Acme Corp\", \"Globex Solutions\", \"Stark Industries\").\n- **Action:** User types \"Acme\" into the search input (placeholder text \"Search clients by name, tag, or contact...\").\n- **Expected:** The clients table updates to show only clients whose name contains \"Acme\" (e.g., \"Acme Corp\"). Non-matching clients are hidden. The search is case-insensitive and debounced.\n\n#### Search input filters clients by tag\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients that have various tags (e.g., \"SaaS\", \"Enterprise\", \"Legacy\", \"Partner\").\n- **Action:** User types \"Enterprise\" into the search input.\n- **Expected:** The clients table updates to show only clients that have a tag containing \"Enterprise\" (e.g., \"Acme Corp\" with tags \"SaaS, Enterprise, Q3-Target\"). Clients without a matching tag are hidden.\n\n#### Search input filters clients by contact name\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients that have primary contacts (e.g., \"Sarah Jenkins\", \"Michael Chen\").\n- **Action:** User types \"Sarah\" into the search input.\n- **Expected:** The clients table updates to show only clients whose primary contact name contains \"Sarah\" (e.g., \"Acme Corp\" with primary contact \"Sarah Jenkins (CEO)\"). Clients without a matching contact are hidden.\n\n#### Search input clears and shows all clients\n- **Initial state:** The search input contains \"Acme\" and only matching clients are shown.\n- **Action:** User clears the search input.\n- **Expected:** All clients are displayed again without any name/tag/contact filter applied.\n\n#### Status filter dropdown shows all status options\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded.\n- **Action:** User clicks the Status filter dropdown (showing \"Status: All\").\n- **Expected:** A dropdown appears with options: \"All\", \"Active\", \"Inactive\", \"Prospect\", and \"Churned\".
