But the test says \"three distinct sections\" generically. Looking at the specific test:\n\n- \"Section is hidden when not authenticated\" for EmailNotificationsSection\n- \"Page displays three sections\" - says three sections with visible headings\n\nThese seem contradictory for unauthenticated users, but the \"Page displays three sections\" test probably assumes authenticated state. My code already handles this correctly - EmailNotificationsSection returns null when not authenticated.\n\nLet me also verify the WebhookModal's event handling is correct. In the test, when editing a webhook, events are stored as labels like \"Deal Created\", \"Task Completed\". But in my modal I was converting keys to labels on save. Let me check if I need to handle the edit mode correctly.\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/WebhookModal.tsx\nThere's an issue. In the modal, events are stored by key (e.g., `deal_stage_changed`), but when loading from the webhook in edit mode, the events from the API come as labels (e.g., \"Deal Stage Changed\").

Let me verify the SettingsPage renders properly by checking that the page header follows the convention and all test IDs match.\n\nLet me do a quick review of test entries vs my code to make sure all data-testid attributes are properly set.\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md\nLet me review the test entry about \"Page displays three sections\" - this means when NOT authenticated, only Import & Export and Webhooks should be visible (Email Notifications hidden). But the test says \"three distinct sections\" generically. Looking at the specific test:\n\n- \"Section is hidden when not authenticated\" for EmailNotificationsSection\n- \"Page displays three sections\" - says three sections with visible headings\n\nThese seem contradictory for unauthenticated users, but the \"Page displays three sections\" test probably assumes authenticated state. My code already handles this correctly - EmailNotificationsSection returns null when not authenticated.\n\nLet me also verify the WebhookModal's event handling is correct. In the test, when editing a webhook, events are stored as labels like \"Deal Created\", \"Task Completed\". But in my modal I was converting keys to labels on save. Let me check if I need to handle the edit mode correctly.\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/WebhookModal.tsx\nThere's an issue. In the modal, events are stored by key (e.g., `deal_stage_changed`), but when loading from the webhook in edit mode, the events from the API come as labels (e.g., \"Deal Stage Changed\"). I need to convert them back to keys when loading for edit. Let me fix this.\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/WebhookModal.tsx\nI need to convert labels back to keys when loading webhook data for editing. Let me fix this:\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/WebhookModal.tsx\nNow let me run check again to make sure everything is still clean.\n$ npm run check 2>&1 | head -20\n> sales-crm@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nAll checks pass.

Let me build this step by step. First, I'll update the backend to return owned deals, assigned tasks, and recent activity. Then create the Redux slice, then each component.\n\nLet me update the backend `users.ts` to return full detail data for a single user:\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/users.ts\nNow create the `userDetailSlice.ts`:\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/userDetailSlice.ts\nNow register the new slice in the store:\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store.ts\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store.ts\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store.ts\nNow let's create the UserHeader component:\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/UserHeader.tsx\n[TodoWrite]\nNow the UserStats component:\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/UserStats.tsx\n[TodoWrite]\nNow the OwnedDealsList component:\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/OwnedDealsList.tsx\n[TodoWrite]\nNow the AssignedTasksList component:\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/AssignedTasksList.tsx\n[TodoWrite]\nNow the RecentActivityFeed component:\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/RecentActivityFeed.tsx\n[TodoWrite]\nNow write the UserDetailPage:\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/UserDetailPage.tsx\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/UserDetailPage.tsx\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/UserDetailPage.tsx\nNow I need to add the CSS styles for all the new components. Let me add them at the end of the CSS file:\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css\nNow let me run the type check to verify everything compiles correctly:\n$ cd /repo/apps/SalesCRM && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -60\nTypeScript passes cleanly. Let me also run lint:\n$ npm run check 2>&1 | tail -20\n> sales-crm@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nAll checks pass. Let me mark the final task as complete:\n[TodoWrite]\nAll 6 subtasks are complete. Here's a summary of what was built:\n\n**Backend Changes:**\n- `netlify/functions/users.ts` - Extended the GET `/:id` endpoint to return owned deals, assigned tasks, and recent activity alongside user stats\n\n**New Redux Slice:**\n- `src/userDetailSlice.ts` - Manages user detail state with `fetchUserDetail` thunk and `clearUserDetail` action; stores user info, deals, tasks, and activity\n- `src/store.ts` - Registered `userDetailReducer` in the Redux store\n\n**New Components:**\n1. `src/components/UserHeader.tsx` - Displays avatar (with initials fallback), name, email, join date, and back navigation to team page\n2. `src/components/UserStats.tsx` - Shows 3 stat cards: Active Deals, Open Tasks, Total Deals\n3. `src/components/OwnedDealsList.tsx` - Lists user's owned deals with name, client, stage badge, and value; clickable to navigate to deal detail; empty state\n4. `src/components/AssignedTasksList.tsx` - Lists assigned tasks with title, client, due date, priority badge, and status badge; clickable to task detail; empty state\n5. `src/components/RecentActivityFeed.tsx` - Shows activity entries in reverse chronological order with event-type icons, descriptions, and relative timestamps; empty state\n\n**Updated Page:**\n- `src/pages/UserDetailPage.tsx` - Full page with loading/error states, fetches user detail on mount, renders all 5 components in a structured layout\n\n**CSS:**\n- Added comprehensive styles for the user detail page, stats cards, list items, deal stage badges, task priority/status badges, and activity feed\n\nAll code passes `npm run check` (typecheck + lint) cleanly.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 413655ms | Turns: 51 | Cost: $2.4783\nCost: $2.4783 (total: $263.5346)\nTurns: 51\nTask signaled <DONE>.

I'm running a series of directory and file searches across the repository to map out the structure of each app—looking at the SalesCRM, Accounting, InventoryTracker, ProductionHub, and SupplierTracker applications, checking their source files, components, pages, and shared utilities to understand the codebase layout. I'm checking the SupplierTracker app structure and verifying that the QuickActions, UpcomingOrdersTable, SuppliersList, and DashboardPage components are already fully implemented. I'm exploring the SupplierTracker repository structure and running type checks to ensure everything compiles correctly, then moving on to build out the OrderSummary, LineItemsTable, CostBreakdown, OrderDocuments, OrderHistory, and OrderDetailsPage components. I'm verifying that the SupplierOverview, DocumentsTab, CommentsSection, and SupplierDetailsPage components were already implemented in the previous task, so no additional work is needed here.\n\nNow I'm setting up a deployment task for the Accounting app by adding subtasks to test and deploy it to production. I'm also examining the SupplierTracker app to identify which components still need to be written—OrderSummary, LineItemsTable, CostBreakdown, OrderDocuments, OrderHistory, and OrderDetailsPage.
