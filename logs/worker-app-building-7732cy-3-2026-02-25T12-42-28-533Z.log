Let me also check if SalesCRM already has code since it has an AppRevisions.md.\n$ for dir in /repo/apps/*/; do name=$(basename \"$dir\"); has_src=\"no\"; [ -d \"$dir/src\" ] && has_src=\"yes\"; has_spec=\"no\"; [ -f \"$dir/AppSpec.md\" ] && has_spec=\"yes\"; echo \"$name: spec=$has_spec src=$has_src\"; done\nAccounting: spec=yes src=no\nInventoryTracker: spec=yes src=no\nProductionHub: spec=yes src=no\nSalesCRM: spec=yes src=no\nSupplierTracker: spec=yes src=no\nAll 5 apps have specs but no source code yet. I need to queue build tasks for each one. Per the `buildInitialApp.md` skill, each app needs 7 stages queued with `--trailing` to append them in order.\n[TodoWrite]\nNow let me check the skill files to see if they expect app-specific subtask descriptions.\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\nGood. The skill files handle the unpacking themselves. Now I need to understand if the subtask descriptions need to reference the specific app. Let me check the `add-task.ts` script to see if there's an `--app` flag or similar.\n[read] /repo/scripts/add-task.ts\nI see there's no `--app` flag. Let me check how the worker knows which app to work on. Let me look at the worker script.\n$ ls /repo/scripts/\nadd-task.ts\n$ ls /repo/skills/tasks/build/\ntestSpec.md\ntesting.md\nwriteApp.md\nwriteShared.md\nwriteTests.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\nI see the skills reference `AppSpec.md` relatively — this suggests the worker runs with a working directory set to the app's directory. Let me check the `buildInitialApp.md` skill more carefully to see if there's a way to specify which app.\n\nLooking at the buildInitialApp.md skill again, the template commands don't include any app-specific parameter. The subtask descriptions themselves should identify the app. Let me check if there's a convention for this by looking at any existing patterns.\n[grep] APP_DIR|appDir|app.dir|--app|appName|APP_NAME\n[grep] app.*subtask|subtask.*app|Unpack.*Write|Unpack.*Build\nThe subtask descriptions don't include the app name. Let me check how the worker determines which app to work on. Let me look for worker-related files.\n[glob] **/worker*\n[read] /repo/src/worker.ts\n[grep] APP_DIR|APP_NAME|CURRENT_APP|currentApp|appName\n[grep] CLAUDE\\.md|claude\\.md|CLAUDE_MD\n[grep] extraArgs|--allowedTools|AGENTS\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/deployment.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/writeScript.md\nNow I understand the structure. The skills reference things like `AppSpec.md` relative to the app directory. The subtask descriptions should include the app name so the agent knows which app's directory to work in. Let me look at how the subtask format encodes the app name.\n\nLooking at the `buildInitialApp.md` skill, the template subtasks don't explicitly include the app name, but the skill itself references `AppSpec.md` - the agent will need to figure out which app from context. Since we're queuing tasks for multiple apps, the subtask descriptions should include the ap... (truncated)\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern where the subtask names encode the app:\n[grep] SalesCRM|Accounting|InventoryTracker|ProductionHub|SupplierTracker\n[grep] Unpack.*app|app.*Unpack\nNow I understand the system. I need to queue 7 build stages per app using `--trailing` to append them in order. I'll include the app name in each subtask so the agent knows which app to work on.\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --subtask \"Unpack: Write test specification for Accounting\" --trailing && npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md\" --subtask \"Unpack: Write app shared code for Accounting\" --trailing && ...

Let me also check if SalesCRM already has code since it has an AppRevisions.md.\n$ for dir in /repo/apps/*/; do name=$(basename \"$dir\"); has_src=\"no\"; [ -d \"$dir/src\" ] && has_src=\"yes\"; has_spec=\"no\"; [ -f \"$dir/AppSpec.md\" ] && has_spec=\"yes\"; echo \"$name: spec=$has_spec src=$has_src\"; done\nAccounting: spec=yes src=no\nInventoryTracker: spec=yes src=no\nProductionHub: spec=yes src=no\nSalesCRM: spec=yes src=no\nSupplierTracker: spec=yes src=no\nAll 5 apps have specs but no source code yet. I need to queue build tasks for each one. Per the `buildInitialApp.md` skill, each app needs 7 stages queued with `--trailing` to append them in order.\n[TodoWrite]\nNow let me check the skill files to see if they expect app-specific subtask descriptions.\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\nGood. The skill files handle the unpacking themselves. Now I need to understand if the subtask descriptions need to reference the specific app. Let me check the `add-task.ts` script to see if there's an `--app` flag or similar.\n[read] /repo/scripts/add-task.ts\nI see there's no `--app` flag. Let me check how the worker knows which app to work on. Let me look at the worker script.\n$ ls /repo/scripts/\nadd-task.ts\n$ ls /repo/skills/tasks/build/\ntestSpec.md\ntesting.md\nwriteApp.md\nwriteShared.md\nwriteTests.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\nI see the skills reference `AppSpec.md` relatively — this suggests the worker runs with a working directory set to the app's directory. Let me check the `buildInitialApp.md` skill more carefully to see if there's a way to specify which app.\n\nLooking at the buildInitialApp.md skill again, the template commands don't include any app-specific parameter. The subtask descriptions themselves should identify the app. Let me check if there's a convention for this by looking at any existing patterns.\n[grep] APP_DIR|appDir|app.dir|--app|appName|APP_NAME\n[grep] app.*subtask|subtask.*app|Unpack.*Write|Unpack.*Build\nThe subtask descriptions don't include the app name. Let me check how the worker determines which app to work on. Let me look for worker-related files.\n[glob] **/worker*\n[read] /repo/src/worker.ts\n[grep] APP_DIR|APP_NAME|CURRENT_APP|currentApp|appName\n[grep] CLAUDE\\.md|claude\\.md|CLAUDE_MD\n[grep] extraArgs|--allowedTools|AGENTS\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/src/server.ts\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/deployment.md\n[read] /repo/skills/tasks/writeScript.md\nNow I understand the structure. The skills reference things like `AppSpec.md` relative to the app directory. The subtask descriptions should include the app name so the agent knows which app's directory to work in. Let me look at how the subtask format encodes the app name.\n\nLooking at the `buildInitialApp.md` skill, the template subtasks don't explicitly include the app name, but the skill itself references `AppSpec.md` - the agent will need to figure out which app from context. Since we're queuing tasks for multiple apps, the subtask descriptions should include the ap... (truncated)\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern where the subtask names encode the app:\n[grep] SalesCRM|Accounting|InventoryTracker|ProductionHub|SupplierTracker\n[grep] Unpack.*app|app.*Unpack\nNow I understand the system. I need to queue 7 build stages per app using `--trailing` to append them in order. I'll include the app name in each subtask so the agent knows which app to work on.\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --subtask \"Unpack: Write test specification for Accounting\" --trailing && npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md\" --subtask \"Unpack: Write app shared code for Accounting\" --trailing && ...

Let me verify the files look correct by quickly reading the key components:\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx\n[TodoWrite]\nAll 5 subtasks are complete. Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n**1. TransactionHeaderFields** (`src/components/TransactionHeaderFields.tsx`):\n- Date input, Description input, and Currency dropdown in a single horizontal row\n- Currency uses SearchableSelect with USD/EUR/GBP/JPY options\n- Description field takes the most horizontal space (flex: 2)\n- Proper test IDs: `transaction-date`, `transaction-description`, `transaction-currency`\n\n**2. LineItemsTable** (`src/components/LineItemsTable.tsx`):\n- Section heading \"Transaction Details (Line Items)\"\n- Column headers: Account, Type, Amount, plus delete button column\n- Account dropdown shows accounts with codes (e.g., \"Checking Account (1010)\") with \"Select Account\" placeholder\n- Type is now a proper SearchableSelect dropdown with \"Debit\"/\"Credit\" options (was a toggle)\n- Add Line Item button, delete buttons, initial 2 empty rows\n- All required test IDs\n\n**3. BalanceIndicator** (`src/components/BalanceIndicator.tsx`):\n- Shows \"Total Debits\" and \"Total Credits\" with formatted currency amounts\n- Displays \"Transaction is Balanced\" (green checkmark) or \"Transaction is Unbalanced\" (red X)\n- Test IDs: `balance-indicator`, `total-debits`, `total-credits`, `balance-status`\n\n**4. TagsInput** (`src/components/TagsInput.tsx`):\n- Label \"Tags / Categories (optional)\" with muted optional indicator\n- Tag chips with × remove buttons\n- Supports Enter and comma key to add tags\n- Prevents duplicate tags\n\n**5. NewTransactionModal** (`src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`):\n- Composed from all 4 sub-components\n- Supports edit mode via optional `editTransaction` prop (pre-populates all fields)\n- Creates or updates transactions via Redux thunks\n- Added `updateTransaction` thunk to `transactionsSlice.ts`\n- Balance validation prevents saving unbalanced transactions\n\n**CSS updates** in `index.css`: Added `.transaction-header-fields` row layout, `.line-items-section-heading`, `.form-label-optional` styles.\n\nType check and lint pass cleanly.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 402626ms | Turns: 42 | Cost: $2.3694\nCost: $2.3694 (total: $158.0731)\nTurns: 42\nTask signaled <DONE>.

Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n**1. TransactionHeaderFields** (`src/components/TransactionHeaderFields.tsx`):\n- Date input, Description input, and Currency dropdown in a single horizontal row\n- Currency uses SearchableSelect with USD/EUR/GBP/JPY options\n- Description field takes the most horizontal space (flex: 2)\n- Proper test IDs: `transaction-date`, `transaction-description`, `transaction-currency`\n\n**2. LineItemsTable** (`src/components/LineItemsTable.tsx`):\n- Section heading \"Transaction Details (Line Items)\"\n- Column headers: Account, Type, Amount, plus delete button column\n- Account dropdown shows accounts with codes (e.g., \"Checking Account (1010)\") with \"Select Account\" placeholder\n- Type is now a proper SearchableSelect dropdown with \"Debit\"/\"Credit\" options (was a toggle)\n- Add Line Item button, delete buttons, initial 2 empty rows\n- All required test IDs\n\n**3. BalanceIndicator** (`src/components/BalanceIndicator.tsx`):\n- Shows \"Total Debits\" and \"Total Credits\" with formatted currency amounts\n- Displays \"Transaction is Balanced\" (green checkmark) or \"Transaction is Unbalanced\" (red X)\n- Test IDs: `balance-indicator`, `total-debits`, `total-credits`, `balance-status`\n\n**4. TagsInput** (`src/components/TagsInput.tsx`):\n- Label \"Tags / Categories (optional)\" with muted optional indicator\n- Tag chips with × remove buttons\n- Supports Enter and comma key to add tags\n- Prevents duplicate tags\n\n**5. NewTransactionModal** (`src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`):\n- Composed from all 4 sub-components\n- Supports edit mode via optional `editTransaction` prop (pre-populates all fields)\n- Creates or updates transactions via Redux thunks\n- Added `updateTransaction` thunk to `transactionsSlice.ts`\n- Balance validation prevents saving unbalanced transactions\n\n**CSS updates** in `index.css`: Added `.transaction-header-fields` row layout, `.line-items-section-heading`, `.form-label-optional` styles.\n\nType check and lint pass cleanly.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 402626ms | Turns: 42 | Cost: $2.3694\nCost: $2.3694 (total: $158.0731)\nTurns: 42\nTask signaled <DONE>.
