If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type).

Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   153→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   154→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   155→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   156→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4f2989be-5148-416f-80ce-beb3a83fcb24","uuid":"6cec2005-24f6-4710-ac24-3a2c3a4c3a22","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Let me now systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecDealDetailPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations\n\nI need to check if the test entries in DealDetailPage section of tests.md follow all the directives in testSpec.md. Let me review the directives:\n\n1. Images of different pages should have consistent styling/navigation\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't replace mockup elements with simpler alternatives just because they're easier to build\n4. Every clickable element needs a test specifying exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers\n5. Any data-mutating action requires tests confirming persistence and verifying all expected side effects occur\n6. Visual appearance of buttons and controls is testable and matters\n7. Modal dialogs need comprehensive testing for proper functionality\n8. File upload capabilities must be fully supported in attachment features\n9.

[2026-02-27T03:24:00.267Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_0114sMWN4715PWJordsW7wGs","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me systematically check the testSpec.md directives against the DealDetailPage test entries. Let me go through each directive:\n\n**Directive 1: Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.**\n- This is more of a general guidance. No specific violation here.\n\n**Directive 2: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n\nLet me check the mockup against the test entries:\n\n\nI'm going through the mockup and verifying that all visible elements are covered by tests — the page title with deal details, client and value fields, owner assignment, stage dropdown with the change stage button, and the deal stage pipeline showing the progression through lead, qualification, discovery, and proposal stages are all accounted for. , Negotiation, Closed Won ✅ (tested extensively)\n- Deal History section ✅ (tested)\n- Deal Metrics section with Probability and Expected Close ✅ (tested)\n- Writeups section with \"+ New Entry\" button ✅ (tested)\n- Writeup entries with Edit and Version History buttons ✅ (tested)\n- Linked Tasks section with \"Add Task\" button ✅ (tested)\n- Linked task entries with checkboxes ✅ (tested)\n- Attachments section with upload icon ✅ (tested)\n- Attachment entries with Download and Delete links ✅ (tested)\n- Contacts/Individuals section ✅ (tested)\n- Contact entries with avatar, name, role, organization, and View Profile link ✅ (tested)\n\nNow I'm examining the mockup layout more carefully—it looks like Deal History and Writeups are on the left, while Deal Metrics, Linked Tasks, Attachments, and Contacts/Individuals are on the right. But checking the actual page code, the main section contains Deal History, Deal Metrics, and Writeups, with Attachments and Contacts/Individuals in the sidebar, so there's a mismatch between the mockup layout and the current implementation. I'm noticing a discrepancy between the mockup layout and the current code structure. The mockup has Deal History and Writeups on the left column with Deal Metrics, Linked Tasks, Attachments, and Contacts/Individuals on the right, but the code is putting most sections in the main area with only Attachments and Contacts in the sidebar. This is more of a layout concern than a testSpec violation, though I should check if Directive 3 about not substituting easier implementations applies here—particularly with the Owner field, which appears to be a text input in the mockup but the test spec describes it as a FilterSelect dropdown.\n\nLooking closer at the mockup, the Owner field doesn't show a dropdown indicator like the Stage field does, but using a dropdown for user selection makes functional sense and likely represents an acceptable interpretation of the mockup rather than a violation. Now I need to examine Directive 4 to ensure every clickable element has a specified navigation target or action result.\n\nGoing through the interactive elements: the client name navigates to the client detail page, the stage button updates the database and pipeline, the edit and version history buttons open their respective views, the new entry button opens the form, task checkboxes mark completion, task titles navigate to task details, the add task button opens a form, file operations handle uploads and downloads with appropriate confirmations, and the profile link navigates to the individual's page. All clickable elements have their destinations or outcomes accounted for.\n\nNow I'm verifying that data mutations create the right side effects—changing the owner, stage, or values creates timeline entries, and actions like creating writeups, completing tasks, and creating tasks all trigger timeline entries plus follower notifications where appropriate. The coverage looks solid across all mutation scenarios.\n\nI'm checking that button appearance matches the mockups, starting with the \"+ New Entry\" button styling and text...\n\nContinuing through the button verification...\n\nI need to ensure modal dialogs are thoroughly tested—the writeup creation and editing flows, version history viewing, task creation, attachment uploads, and delete confirmations all need to handle opening, submitting, validating, and canceling properly.\n\nFor attachments, the test spec calls for a file picker with browse and drag-and-drop support, which is covered. Import dialogs with data format specifications don't apply here since this is just a file upload. Backend integration setup isn't relevant to this component either.\n\nNow checking that state-changing actions propagate correctly across the app—timeline entries, stage pipeline updates, and deal title changes all need corresponding tests to verify the UI reflects those mutations.\n\nLooking back at the mockup more carefully, the \"Needs Analysis\" writeup entry appears cut off at the bottom, which is why the Edit and Version History buttons aren't visible there, but the test spec correctly expects these buttons on every entry since they should all be present. I'm noticing a discrepancy between the mockup and test entries around the client name—the heading uses \"Acme Corp\" while the Client field shows \"Acme Corporation,\" and I need to verify which naming convention the tests are actually expecting. the mockup more carefully. The directive says to systematically inventory every visible element, so I should check if I've covered all the column headers, filters, buttons, and labels mentioned in the mockup against what's actually tested.\n\nLooking at the writeup entries, I notice the mockup shows a \"Needs Analysis\" card but doesn't display Edit or Version History buttons for it—though the test entries do include these for all writeup entries. I'm also checking whether delete functionality should apply to writeup entries themselves, since the mockup doesn't show a delete button there but does show one for attachments.\n\nFor linked tasks, the mockup and test entries both lack delete or unlink operations—tasks can be marked complete but not removed from the deal's linked section. The test entries also don't specify layout positioning for DealHistorySection versus DealMetrics, which is fine since they're focused on content rather than layout.\n\nNow I need to verify that every clickable element in the test entries has corresponding coverage, then check both writeApp.md and writeTests.md for any violations. I've verified all the interactive elements and their behaviors. Now I'm reconsidering the Owner field—it's labeled as a FilterSelect dropdown in the specs, but the mockup shows it as a plain text input like the Client and Value fields. However, a dropdown actually makes more sense functionally for selecting from a user list, and it's not simpler to implement than a text input, so this isn't cutting corners on the design. I think using a FilterSelect dropdown for Owner is actually the right call here—it's more complex than a simple text field, not simpler, and it's the proper UX pattern for selecting team members. That shouldn't violate the directive.\n\nNow I'm checking the layout structure in the actual component code against what the mockup shows. The right column should have Deal Metrics at the top, followed by Linked Tasks, Attachments, and Contacts, while the left has Deal History and Writeups. Let me verify how the grid is actually organized in the implementation. The test entries look comprehensive and correctly use generic language like \"each\" to cover all writeup entries including the Needs Analysis section with its Edit and Version History buttons. Scanning the mockup again, I don't see any visual elements that aren't already addressed by the test specifications. Now I should move forward to evaluate subtasks 2 and 3.\n\nLooking at the test entries more carefully, I notice they include several important behaviors beyond what's visible in the mockup—like editable metrics, timeline side effects, N/A fallback states, empty states, and form validation with cancel functionality—which are all solid additions for completeness.\n\nI'm also verifying that the test entries map to all 8 components listed in the page structure: DealHeader, DealStagePipeline, DealHistorySection, DealMetricsSection, WriteupsSection, LinkedTasksSection, DealAttachmentsSection, and ContactsIndividualsSection. The coverage looks complete across all of them.\n\nThe testSpec validation for DealDetailPage is clean—no violations. Now I'm moving on to check for any writeApp.md directive violations in the DealDetailPage components. I need to read all the component files and check them against the writeApp.md directives.\n\nThe directives from writeApp.md are:\n1. Always run `npm run check` from the app directory\n2. When working on a component, identify test entries and make sure requirements are satisfied\n3. Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes\n5. In monorepo, add `base` to netlify.toml\n6. When using neon serverless driver, only use tagged template literal syntax\n7. For DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns, convert empty strings to null\n8. Netlify Functions path index for resourceId\n9. Use searchable select/dropdown for entity references, not plain text input\n10. No duplicate navigation links\n11. Never use native HTML `<select>` elements\n12. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n13. Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads\n14.

The neon driver is being used with the `sql(text, params)` pattern — this is the `sql(queryString, paramsArray)` pattern which the directive says is NOT allowed. The directive says:\n\n> When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal syntax for queries: `sql\\`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}\\``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n\nThe shared `db.ts` helper uses `sql(text, params)` which is the function call syntax, NOT the tagged template literal syntax. This is a violation, but it's in the shared backend code, not in the DealDetailPage components specifically. This would be a \"backend\" issue rather than a DealDetailPage-specific issue.\n \nI need to clarify the scope here — the subtask is specifically about DealDetailPage components, which are the React components in the frontend. The backend functions are separate, though they're called by Redux thunks that feed into these components. Since the neon directive is a writeApp.md rule that applies across the codebase, I should check whether the backend violations are within scope or if I should focus only on the component layer itself.\n\nLet me work through the writeApp.md directives systematically against the DealDetailPage components. The operational directive about running `npm run check` isn't a code check, so I'll skip that. For the test entry requirements, I need to verify that the component code satisfies all relevant test entry conditions. I also need to compare the component's visual rendering against the mockup, and ensure that all interactive elements, containers, and list items have proper `data-testid` attributes for E2E testing.\n\nGoing through each component, I'm verifying that the testids are in place: DealDetailPage has the main page testid, DealHeader covers header elements and interactive controls like the stage change button, DealStagePipeline includes pipeline and progress tracking testids, DealHistorySection has section and entry-level testids, DealMetricsSection covers probability and close-date inputs with their associated testids, and WriteupsSection includes the new entry button and card-level testids.\n\nContinuing down the list, LinkedTasksSection has testids for the add button, task list, and the modal for adding new tasks with all its form fields, DealAttachmentsSection covers upload functionality and attachment management testids, and ContactsIndividualsSection has the basic section and list structure testids in place.\n\nNow I'm checking some configuration and database directives. The netlify.toml needs a base path set for the monorepo structure, and there's a requirement about using tagged template literals with the neon serverless driver. I also notice there's a directive about handling empty strings in database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types by converting them to null before any insert or update operations.\n\nLooking at the DealMetricsSection component, when the user clears the close date field and saves, it's passing `undefined` instead of `null`, which means the field won't actually be sent in the request body. The backend does handle this correctly with the `||` operator, but there's a mismatch in intent — if the user explicitly clears the date, it should be set to null rather than left unchanged. Looking at the frontend components, the DealMetricsSection doesn't directly touch the database, so those backend directives about empty string conversion don't apply here. Moving through the other directives — the LinkedTasksSection and DealHeader both properly use searchable FilterSelect components for selecting assignees and owners, which satisfies the requirement for entity references. Now checking whether native HTML select elements are being used anywhere.\n\nI've confirmed through a grep search that there are no native `<select>` elements in the codebase. The DealAttachmentsSection correctly implements file-type-specific icons using a FileIcon component that renders different SVG icons based on file type, and it supports actual file uploads with a file input and upload modal. The DealDetailPage applies the consistent padding classes on the main container, and I'm checking whether the loading state also has the proper padding applied.\n\nI'm noticing there's a distinction between the Tips section and the actual Directives—the layout-agnostic component guidance appears to be a tip rather than a hard requirement. The components use a `detail-section` class for spacing, which is appropriate since it's a container class rather than direct padding on the root element. Now I'm cross-referencing the writeApp.md spec to verify that test entry requirements are being met, starting with checking whether the WriteupsSection has an Edit button with a pencil icon for each writeup entry.\n\nLooking at the test requirements more closely, I see the Edit button should display both text and an icon according to the mockup, but the current implementation only renders an SVG icon with a title attribute—there's no visible \"Edit\" text label on the button itself. The component is missing text labels on both the Edit and Version History buttons, which violates the spec requirement to match the mockup's visual appearance. I'm checking other buttons like \"+ New Entry\" and \"Add Task\" to see if they're correctly implemented with their text labels, and I notice the mockup shows text alongside icons in most places.\n\nNow I'm examining the layout structure more carefully—the mockup has a two-column design with Deal History and Writeups on the left, while the actual code puts DealMetrics and LinkedTasks in the main area instead of the sidebar where they should be. Looking at the actual structure in the code, DealMetrics and LinkedTasks are positioned in the main column when they should be in the right sidebar based on the mockup layout. I need to verify whether the CSS grid is handling this repositioning, or if the component structure itself needs to be reorganized to match the intended two-column design where Deal History and Writeups occupy the left side while Metrics, Tasks, Attachments, and Contacts fill the right.\n\nThe clearer issues I should focus on are the missing text labels on the WriteupsSection buttons—the Edit and Version History buttons lack visible text that matches the mockup specifications. Both the test specifications and mockup clearly expect visible text labels next to the icons, but the current implementation only renders the icons themselves without any accompanying text. I need to add \"Edit\" and \"Version History\" text labels to these buttons.\n\nSince both action buttons in the WriteupsSection component share the same issue, I should group them into a single fix task rather than creating separate ones.\n\nLet me verify the other directives are being followed—DealDetailPage is properly abstracting all rendered JSX into imported components, and I should check whether the writeups section modal creation aligns with the test expectations.\n\nLooking at the test requirements: the modal needs fields for title and content, which the code has; the form validates required fields by checking for empty strings; cancel closes without saving; and versioning is handled on the backend when updateWriteup is dispatched. The main violations I'm seeing are those missing text labels on the Edit and Delete buttons.\n\nLet me verify the other components match the mockup — \"Add Task\" and \"+ New Entry\" buttons both have their text labels, and the upload icon is correctly icon-only. So the WriteupsSection is where the issues are. The test specifically says the Edit button should be visible with a pencil icon, which suggests it needs text alongside the icon to function as a proper button, not just an icon
