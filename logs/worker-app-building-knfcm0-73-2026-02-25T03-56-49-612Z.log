This is the single entry point for running\ntests during development and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n   previous runs.\n\n2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n\n3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n\n4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n   test data.\n\n5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n   prior runs.\n\n6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n   `DATABASE_URL`. Capture the exit code.\n\n7. **On failure** (non-zero exit code):\n   a. Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n   b. Log full metadata for every recording that has test metadata in a delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, log `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n      On failure, log the exit code.\n\n8. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n9. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: Playwright test output, recording metadata block, upload confirmations.\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON. The\n  `addMetadata` entries contain `metadata.test.result` which indicates pass/fail.\n- The Playwright config must use the Replay browser via `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n  from `@replayio/playwright` and include `replayReporter` with `upload: false`.\n- The HTML reporter must use `open: 'never'` to suppress the interactive \"Serving HTML report\"\n  prompt that blocks the script from exiting.\n- Run Playwright with `--retries 0` — no retries. Failures must be analyzed via Replay.\n- Use `child_process.execSync` or `execFileSync` for subprocess calls, inheriting stdio for\n  Playwright output.\n- The `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` env var is already set in the container.\n","numLines":99,"startLine":1,"totalLines":99}}}

The app needs a package.json, scripts directory, and the three scripts. Since the other reference apps (Accounting, InventoryTracker, ProductionHub) all follow the same pattern, I should create scripts that match. \n\nBut wait - does SalesCRM have a schema.ts, seed-db.ts, or migrate-db.ts? The glob earlier showed no scripts/*.ts files in SalesCRM. The deploy.ts and test.ts scripts import from these files. I need to be careful here - I should write the scripts in a way that they reference these files but handle the case where they may not exist yet.\n \nLooking at how the Accounting app structures its scripts, deploy.ts and test.ts both have hard dependencies on schema.js through imports. Since SalesCRM doesn't have schema.ts yet, these scripts will fail at runtime if I follow the same pattern exactly. But the design doc asks me to match the existing patterns, so I'll write them the same way - the scripts themselves will be valid TypeScript, they'll just need schema.ts to exist before they can actually run. I'm realizing the core issue: the deploy and test scripts need to import from schema.js, but that file doesn't exist yet, so typecheck will fail. Since the SalesCRM project doesn't have a package.json or tsconfig.json set up, I can't actually run the verification commands without building out the project structure first. Looking at the commit history, the \"Unpack\" tasks seem to have just created task entries rather than actually implementing the scripts—the real work happened in the \"Write the app\" and \"Write app shared code\" commits that came after.\n\nLet me check the git history to see what files actually exist in the SalesCRM directory right now.","signature":"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

The recent commits mentioning \"Write the app for SalesCRM\" and \"Implement package scripts for SalesCRM\" are task-queue unpacking commits that just added tasks to the queue, not actual implementation. \n\nSince there's no package.json, tsconfig.json, source code, or schema.ts yet, I need to create the scripts directory and the three scripts. However, they reference schema.ts which doesn't exist. The deploy.ts and test.ts scripts in other apps import from `./schema.js`.\n\nI have two options:\n\n\n1. Write the scripts exactly as in the reference apps, even though schema.ts doesn't exist yet (the imports will fail at typecheck)\n2. Write the scripts but handle the case where schema.ts might not exist\n\nActually, looking at this more practically - the SalesCRM app doesn't even have a package.json or node_modules, so I can't run `npm run check`, `npx tsc`, etc. There's nothing to typecheck against. The right approach is to create the scripts directory and write all three scripts following the existing patterns from Accounting - they'll be ready when the rest of the app is built.\n\nFor the schema.ts dependency, I need to figure out how to handle the import since Accounting's deploy.ts imports from `./schema.js` (which resolves to schema.ts in TypeScript). Without schema.ts existing, TypeScript will error. I should write the scripts and create a package.json with the script entries as the skill requires, then see what minimal setup is needed to make the imports work.\n\nLooking at the git history, I notice the earlier \"Write the app for SalesCRM\" and \"Write app shared code for SalesCRM\" tasks show as committed, but the actual files don't seem to exist in the current state. Let me trace through what's actually been done versus what still needs to be created.\n\nThe \"Unpack\" commits appear to have just queued up subtasks rather than generating the actual code. So I need to create the three scripts and a minimal package.json with the script entries to get started, keeping it lean since the full app build will flesh out the dependencies later.\n\nFor the schema imports in deploy.ts and test.ts, I should follow the reference pattern exactly—schema.ts will exist once the app is built. Since there's no tsconfig.json or node_modules yet, I can't run type checking, but I'll proceed with writing the scripts and ensure the package.json is in place with the necessary script entries. json has the entries.\n\nLet me think about whether to create the full package.json or just a minimal one... Looking at the workflow, there will likely be a separate task to \"Write the app for SalesCRM\" that sets up the full package.json, tsconfig.json, etc. If I create a full package.json now, it might conflict with what that task does. If I create a minimal one, the writing task might overwrite it.\n\nI think the safest approach is:\n1. Create the 3 script files\n2. Create a package.json with just the necessary fields (name, type, scripts entries)\n3. The app-writing tasks can add dependencies and other config later\n\nBut actually, without a schema.ts file, deploy.ts and test.ts will have import errors. I need to handle this. Let me look at how InventoryTracker and ProductionHub handle this - maybe they have a different pattern. Let me check ProductionHub which might be a newer app to see how it structures

The ProductionHub deploy.ts also imports `runMigrations` from schema.js. Let me check the ProductionHub test.ts to see if it also imports runMigrations.\n\nSince SalesCRM doesn't have any code yet, I need to:\n1. Create `apps/SalesCRM/scripts/check.ts`\n2. Create `apps/SalesCRM/scripts/deploy.ts` \n3. Create `apps/SalesCRM/scripts/test.ts`\n4. Create or update `apps/SalesCRM/package.json` with script entries\n\nFor the deploy.ts and test.ts, they need to import from `./schema.js`. Since schema.ts doesn't exist yet, I should still write the import as that's what will be needed, but I need to think about how to handle the fact that it doesn't exist.\n\n\nLooking at the design docs, deploy.ts should reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and migration logic from `scripts/migrate-db.ts`, while test.ts needs `initSchema` and seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`. The Accounting test.ts treats migrate-db.ts and seed-db.ts as optional dependencies with `existsSync` checks, but `initSchema` is a hard requirement that's imported directly at the top.\n\nMy approach is to create the scripts following the established patterns, set up a minimal package.json since one doesn't exist, and verify the pattern against ProductionHub's test.ts to ensure consistency across both modules.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5363,"cache_read_input_tokens":45519,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5363,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2f8d972b-d763-4c29-a770-6cf41a7b5f4c","uuid":"d426b12b-b032-40b3-8f31-dfd2998f0cb5"}

Now let me check if we can run the check script. But we don't have a tsconfig.json, so tsc will fail. And schema.ts doesn't exist so the deploy.ts and test.ts will have import errors. Let me check what the skill says about testing again:\n\n> 5. **Test the script**: Run the script to verify it works. If it modifies state (database, files, processes), verify the state changes are correct.\n> 6. **Typecheck and lint**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint .` to verify no errors.\n\nSince the app doesn't have source code, tsconfig, or schema.ts, running `npx tsc --noEmit` will fail. \n\nThe check.ts script itself is self-contained Node code that doesn't require typechecking to work—it just shells out to tsc and eslint. The real issue is that deploy.ts and test.ts depend on schema.ts which doesn't exist yet. I think the right approach is to acknowledge that these scripts follow the established patterns correctly and will function once the app is fully built, rather than trying to typecheck now when we're missing foundational files outside this task's scope. Let me at least verify check.ts works on its own since it's independent.\n\nActually, even check.ts would fail without a tsconfig.json since it runs `npx tsc --noEmit`. The practical reality is that these scripts are written correctly and match the structure of working scripts in other projects, but they can't be meaningfully tested in this pre-build state. Let me just read back the files to confirm they were written correctly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":192,"cache_read_input_tokens":63113,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":192,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2f8d972b-d763-4c29-a770-6cf41a7b5f4c","uuid":"80491792-633f-4079-bd9a-fd08c7b5c4c4"}
