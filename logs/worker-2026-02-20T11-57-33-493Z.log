So the component already seems to be using real file upload via UploadThing.\n \nThe main tasks are actually about adding proper test coverage - I need to document the file upload test in the tests file and create a Playwright test that properly uses `setInputFiles` to simulate file uploads.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":31783,"cache_read_input_tokens":28552,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":31783,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ea23aaaa-c9b9-43fd-89b2-d3506049ef5c","uuid":"036811db-9dbb-4e26-90a8-dc0976eeb4d7"}

Looking at the code:\n\n1. **UploadAttachmentModal** (deal-detail) - already uses real file upload via `/.netlify/functions/upload` (UploadThing)\n2. **AddAttachmentModal** (client-detail) - also already uses real file upload via the same endpoint\n\nThe job says \"Fix UploadAttachmentModal to use real file upload (UploadThing or server storage) instead of blob URL\". But looking at the code, both modals already call the upload function. Let me check if there was a previous blob URL implementation that was already fixed... \n\n\nActually, the real issue is in the tests. The client-detail test `CDP-QA-07` properly tests file upload with `setInputFiles`, but the deal-detail test `DDP-ATT-03` only covers link mode, not actual file uploads. The test documentation also shows a mismatch—it claims to test \"Uploading a file adds it to attachments list\" but the actual test steps show switching to Link URL mode instead.\n\nRe-reading the job description, I need to: ensure UploadAttachmentModal uses real file upload (which it already does through the netlify function), add a file upload test entry to the docs, and create a Playwright test using `setInputFiles` for the DealDetailPage. Looking at what's documented, there's no specific test entry for file upload via `setInputFiles` on the deal-detail page yet. I'm realizing the mismatch between the test title and what it actually tests, so I need to add a proper file upload test entry and corresponding Playwright test using `setInputFiles`, then verify the component's UploadThing integration handles it correctly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":28566,"cache_read_input_tokens":60335,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":28566,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ea23aaaa-c9b9-43fd-89b2-d3506049ef5c","uuid":"9d362407-1d88-4789-addd-eb7578826828"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   185→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   186→\n   187→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   188→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   189→\n   190→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   191→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   192→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   193→\n   194→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   195→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   196→\n   197→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   198→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   199→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values.

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":116,"startLine":1,"totalLines":116}}}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\n2/14/2026: Sidebar navigation contains only Clients, Deals, and Tasks links. Dashboard, Reports, and Settings links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n2/14/2026: Filter dropdowns on the deals page use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system.\n\n2/16/2026: Deal detail page attachment upload modal now supports both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page now supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n2/16/2026: Task links on client detail page and deal detail page now navigate to /tasks/:taskId (the task detail page) instead of the deal detail page or being non-clickable.\n\n2/16/2026: Added Supabase authentication system. New pages: Login (/login) with email/password and Google OAuth, Register (/register) with name/email/password and Google OAuth, AuthCallback (/auth/callback) for OAuth redirects. All app routes are protected by a RequireAuth guard that redirects unauthenticated users to /login. The sidebar displays the authenticated user's name, avatar, and a sign-out button. All 10 Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware. Timeline events and deal history now attribute actions to the authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n\n2/17/2026: Authentication is now optional. Removed Login and Register pages. Removed RequireAuth route guard — all pages are accessible without authentication. SSO (Google OAuth) now opens in a popup window instead of navigating the current window. The sidebar user area moved to the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated.\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import dialog on the clients page now shows a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Includes a \"Download CSV template\" button that generates a sample CSV file. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import extended to support deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks in addition to clients. Deals page has Import button with CSV format (Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status) — client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with CSV format (Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee) — client lookup by name. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with CSV format (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) — creates individuals and optionally associates them with clients by name. Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n\n2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. The Settings page has two sections: (1) Import & Export — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV. (2) Webhooks — CRUD for webhook configurations that can send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint. Sidebar navigation now includes Clients, Deals, Tasks, and Settings.\n\n2/19/2026: Webhook modal now includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs).
