The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: Playwright test output, recording metadata block, upload confirmations.\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON. The\n  `addMetadata` entries contain `metadata.test.result` which indicates pass/fail.\n- The Playwright config must use the Replay browser via `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n  from `@replayio/playwright` and include `replayReporter` with `upload: false`.\n- The HTML reporter must use `open: 'never'` to suppress the interactive \"Serving HTML report\"\n  prompt that blocks the script from exiting.\n- Run Playwright with `--retries 0` — no retries. Failures must be analyzed via Replay.\n- Use `child_process.execSync` or `execFileSync` for subprocess calls, inheriting stdio for\n  Playwright output.\n- The `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` env var is already set in the container.\n","numLines":99,"startLine":1,"totalLines":99}}}

Since this is an \"Unpack\" task, I need to determine which scripts need to be implemented for SalesCRM, add tasks to the queue using `add-task.ts`, and output `<DONE>` without implementing them myself. The three scripts with design docs are check, deploy, and test.\n\nNow I'm realizing that schema.ts and seed-db.ts are utility modules used by the other scripts—deploy and test both depend on the schema initialization and seeding logic. But SalesCRM doesn't have a package.json or any code structure yet, so I need to figure out the right order: schema.ts first to define the database structure, then seed-db.ts for test data, followed by check.ts, deploy.ts, and test.ts. I also need to account for the package.json itself as a prerequisite.\n\nLooking at what's actually in the SalesCRM directory, there's only documentation—AppRevisions.md, AppSpec.md, and docs—with no code files at all. But the recent git history shows several commits about writing the app, backend middleware, and shared code, so there's been progress on other parts of the project that I'm not seeing in the current state.\n\nThe key insight is that \"Unpack\" in the task name means I need to break down the package scripts implementation into smaller sub-tasks and queue them up, rather than implementing them directly myself.\n\nLooking at the design docs, there are three main scripts with documentation: check, deploy, and test. But I'm realizing that schema.ts and seed-db.ts are critical dependencies that don't have design docs in the skills directory—they're app-specific infrastructure that the other scripts depend on. I need to figure out whether these should be created as separate sub-tasks or if there's an existing process for handling them. I see that schema.ts, seed-db.ts, and migrate-db.ts are referenced as dependencies in the design docs for check, deploy, and test, but they don't have their own design docs in the scripts folder. Looking at how the Accounting app is structured and the task flow from the git log, I need to figure out whether these get created separately or if they're part of a different process. Let me trace through what other apps have done to understand the full picture. I need to break down the script implementation into subtasks for check, deploy, and test based on the design docs available. Deploy and test will need schema.ts, seed-db.ts, and migrate-db.ts as dependencies, but the implementor can create those as needed when working through the writeScript skill. I'm probably overcomplicating this—the unpacking task is just about queuing the work, and the skill will handle the rest. I'm realizing the package.json needs to exist first for any of these scripts to be registered, but looking back at the previous tasks, they only created planning documents—no actual code yet. Let me reconsider the dependency chain: check.ts is independent, but deploy and test both need schema.ts, and deploy also needs migrate-db while test needs seed-db. The question is whether package.json should be its own task or if it gets created as part of the first script implementation.\n\nActually, looking at the git history more carefully, the \"Write the app for SalesCRM\" task was just unpacked into subtasks that haven't executed yet. So the actual source code writing will happen after this unpacking task completes. That means the script implementation tasks I'm creating now will run after the app code is written, which makes sense—the scripts need the source code to exist first.\n\nSince this is just an unpacking task, I need to create subtasks for implementing each script in the right dependency order. I need to order these scripts by their dependencies—check has no dependencies, so it should come first, then deploy which needs schema.ts and migrate-db, and finally test which depends on schema.ts, seed-db, and the playwright config. I'll group all three as subtasks under a single task using the writeScript
