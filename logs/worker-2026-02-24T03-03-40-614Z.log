See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match.

The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"386b6f99-bf44-4cb3-be41-819542cd6cbd","uuid":"d37e6ad1-fb53-49cc-b460-e7dfcbd4e13f","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

The tests.md file already contains:\n\n1. **PlanPageAuthPages**: There are already sections for ForgotPasswordPage, ResetPasswordPage, and ConfirmEmailPage in docs/tests.md (lines 2884-2977).\n\n2. **PlanComponentForgotPassword**: Test entries for ForgotPasswordPage already exist (lines 2888-2912) with: form display, submission success message, loading state, server error, network failure.\n\n3. **PlanComponentResetPassword**: Test entries for ResetPasswordPage already exist (lines 2918-2947) with: form display, password mismatch validation, successful reset, loading state, server error, network failure.\n\n\n4. **PlanComponentConfirmEmail**: Test entries for ConfirmEmailPage already exist (lines 2953-2977) with: loading state, successful confirmation, missing token, invalid/expired token, network error, auto-login.\n\nActually, looking back at the job descriptions more carefully, I see they're asking to \"decide on components\" and \"add sections\" — but these sections are already there, so either the work was already completed or I'm misunderstanding what the jobs actually require.\n\nLet me check each page against what the jobs specify. For ForgotPasswordPage, I can see entries covering the email input, success messaging, loading states, and error handling. ResetPasswordPage has the password fields, token validation, and login flow. ConfirmEmailPage handles the URL token, auto-confirmation, and various token error states. They all seem fairly comprehensive based on the job requirements, but I should verify whether these are truly complete or if there are gaps in the test coverage. Looking at the ConfirmEmailPage tests, they're actually pretty comprehensive with loading states, success/redirect flows, and error handling for missing or invalid tokens. But I need to step back and check against my testing strategy—I'm realizing the existing coverage is solid for most interactive elements, though I should verify that email validation and token validation are properly tested across the forgot and reset password flows, and confirm that the reset password flow actually logs the user in as specified. Missing: No token in URL handling (should show error before the form)\n- Missing: Expired/invalid token on page load (should show error instead of form)\n- The \"Successful password reset navigates to /clients\" entry doesn't mention that the user is also logged in\n\nFor ConfirmEmailPage:\n- Seems fairly comprehensive already\n\nLet me look at the job descriptions more carefully to understand what's actually required.\n\nJob 2 asks for ForgotPasswordPage tests covering email input, Resend API submission, success messaging, and validation—but I'm missing the email validation test entries. Job 3 needs ResetPasswordPage tests for token validation (including the no-token case), password field confirmation, and proper login verification after reset, plus token validation happening on page load rather than just after form submission. Job 4 for ConfirmEmailPage looks like it's already covering the main scenarios. So I need to fill in the validation gaps for ForgotPasswordPage, add the missing token-on-load validation for ResetPasswordPage, and ensure the login state is properly verified after password reset. I need to review the existing test sections and enhance them based on the strategy requirements—making sure every visible element is inventoried, all clickable elements specify their navigation targets, and any data mutations are verified for persistence. The strategy also emphasizes testing button appearance and ensuring every interactive element has corresponding test coverage.\n\nLooking at the three auth pages, I can see what's missing: ForgotPasswordPage needs tests for email validation edge cases and the back-to-sign-in navigation; ResetPasswordPage requires tests for missing or invalid tokens, password length validation, and auto-login behavior on success; ConfirmEmailPage is mostly non-interactive but needs to verify its loading, success, and error states based on the token from the URL, plus confirm the auto-login and redirect flow works correctly.

The text indicator shows the remaining contacts (e.g., \"Showing 101-120 of 120 contacts\").\n\n#### Pagination updates when search reduces result count\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage shows 120 contacts with 3 pages of pagination.\n- **Action:** User types a search term that returns only 30 contacts.\n- **Expected:** The pagination controls update to reflect the filtered count. The text indicator shows \"Showing 1-30 of 30 contacts\". Since all results fit on one page, the \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons are both disabled and page numbers show only page 1.\n\n#### Pagination hidden when all results fit on one page\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with fewer than 50 contacts (or search results return fewer than 50).\n- **Expected:** The pagination controls are either hidden or show a single page with no Previous/Next navigation needed. The text indicator still shows the count (e.g., \"Showing 1-25 of 25 contacts\").\n\n### ContactsSearchAndActions\n\n#### Search input is displayed with placeholder text\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded.\n- **Expected:** A search input field is visible above the contacts table with placeholder text \"Search contacts...\" (or similar).

Instead, the search waits for the user to stop typing (debounce delay, e.g., 300ms) before filtering the table. This prevents excessive API calls or re-renders during rapid typing. After the debounce delay, the table updates to show contacts matching \"Sar\".\n\n#### Search input clears and shows all contacts\n- **Initial state:** The search input contains \"Sarah\" and only matching contacts are shown.\n- **Action:** User clears the search input (selects all text and deletes, or clicks a clear button if present).\n- **Expected:** All contacts are displayed again without any filter applied. The pagination resets to page 1 with the full contact count.\n\n#### Add Contact button is displayed in page header\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded.\n- **Expected:** An \"Add Contact\" button is visible in the top-right area of the page header.

The dropdown filters to show only clients whose names contain \"Acme\". The user can select a client from the filtered results. Selecting a client populates the Client field. When the search field is focused, it auto-focuses and shows \"No matches\" when no options match the search term.\n\n#### CreateContactModal cancel button closes modal without creating\n- **Initial state:** CreateContactModal is open with some fields filled in (e.g., Name = \"Test Contact\").\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes.

The Name column is marked as required. Title, Email, Phone, and Location are optional text fields. Client Name is optional and performs a lookup by name against existing clients to create the association. A \"Download CSV template\" button is available. A file upload area or file picker is present for selecting a CSV file.\n\n#### ImportDialog CSV format specification is visible before upload\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog for contacts is open.\n- **Expected:** The CSV column format specification table is immediately visible to the user before they attempt any upload.
