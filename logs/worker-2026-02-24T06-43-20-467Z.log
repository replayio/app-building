Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3441bc4e-2b22-4e56-9465-58185a73b570","uuid":"c1393dd1-47f8-4076-a6a7-3a5fc79f1e13","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

The outer container (`.ezxFuW`) is a single-column grid where each child is a full-width row.\n\n```css\n/* Outer list container */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* single column, full-width rows */\ngrid-template-rows: 36px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 308px;\n                  /* ^group header  ^issue rows...                              ^spacer */\n```\n\n- **Group header row**: 36px tall\n- **Issue row**: 44px tall\n- The list container has 14 children: 1 group header + 12 issue rows + 1 spacer\n\n### Issue Row Structure\n\nEach issue row is an `<a>` tag (the full row is clickable) wrapping an inner grid `<div>` with **7 named grid columns**:\n\n| Column       | Content Example          | Font Size | Font Weight | Color             |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `checkbox`   | (empty/checkbox)         | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `priority`   | (priority icon)          | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `identifier` | \"PRO-1247\", \"TT-38\"     | 13px      | 450         | rgb(91, 91, 93)   |\n| `status`     | (status icon)            | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `title`      | \"Contact form not working\" | 13px    | 500         | rgb(26, 26, 26)   |\n| `created`    | (date/avatar info)       | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n| (additional) | (assignee, labels, etc.) | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n\nKey observations:\n- **Identifier** uses muted color `rgb(91, 91, 93)` / `#5b5b5d` with semi-bold weight 450\n- **Title** uses primary color `rgb(26, 26, 26)` / `#1a1a1a` with medium weight 500\n- Both use 13px font size (not the body 16px)\n- The grid uses **named column tracks** (`checkbox`, `priority`, `identifier`, `status`, `title`, `created`) for semantic column placement\n\n### Issue Row Styling\n\n```css\n/* Issue row (A tag) */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-column: 1 / -1;      /* spans full width */\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 44px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nborder: none;              /* 0px none — no visible row borders */\ncursor: default;\ntext-decoration: none;     /* no underline on the link */\noutline: none;             /* focus-visible override */\n```\n\n### Row Separation\n\nRows have **no visible borders** between them. Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nfont-size: 16px;\nfont-weight: 400;\n```\n\nGroup headers contain section names (e.g., \"Other active\") with a count badge (\"19\").\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —         |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`  | ~6% black |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(239, 239, 239)`     | `#efefef` |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(245, 245, 245)`     | `#f5f5f5` |\n| Alt hover (mid)   | `rgb(247, 247, 247)`     | `#f7f7f7` |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(237, 237, 237)`     | `#ededed` |\n\nAll hover backgrounds observed in stylesheets:\n- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)` — primary interactive hover\n- `rgb(239, 239, 239)` — pressed/active\n- `rgb(245, 245, 245)` — sidebar hover\n- `rgb(247, 247, 247)` — light hover\n- `rgb(237, 237, 237)` — selected state\n- `transparent` — reset/clear hover\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: var(--control-border-radius, 4px);\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(45, 46, 47);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background         | Description                |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Default | transparent        | No background              |\n| Hover   | rgb(247, 247, 247) | `#f7f7f7` — subtle gray    |\n| Active  | rgb(238, 238, 238) | `#eeeeee` — slightly darker|\n\nThe hover transition uses `var(--speed-highlightFadeIn)` for a fast, smooth appearance.\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n| `1px solid var(--gray4)`             | Subtle separators        |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#dcdcdc`.\nHover border uses `var(--normal-border-hover)` and `var(--gray5)` for a slightly darker state.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value                              | Usage                     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| `var(--control-border-radius)` 4px | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px                                | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px                                | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%                                | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows are very subtle and use low-opacity black.

[2026-02-24T06:40:38.690Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01AUY6nuuCzdBRS2huYHqbQh","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"I can see from the mockup that the current page uses a specific layout:\n1. A breadcrumb at the top showing \"ClientDetailPage / /clients/acme-corp-451\"\n2. Client name \"Acme Corp\" in large bold text with \"Organization\" badge and \"Active\" badge\n3. Tags row: Enterprise, Software, High Priority, and \"Referral\" with a pencil icon\n4. Quick actions row: Add Task, Add Deal, Add Attachment, Add Person (shown as icon+text buttons)\n5. Source Info section in a card\n6. Two-column layout:\n   - Left column: Tasks, Deals, Attachments\n   - Right column: People, Timeline\n\nLet me verify the exact layout structure against the mockup to make sure all the sections are positioned correctly and that the existing components match what's displayed.\n\nLooking at the components that are already implemented, they seem to cover all the required functionality—ClientHeader handles the name and badges, QuickActions provides the action buttons, SourceInfoSection manages the acquisition details, and the task and deal sections are displaying their content with the expected interactions. I should check if there are any gaps or missing features in these existing implementations. I'm realizing these components were already written in a previous commit, so the worker must have re-queued these same jobs. Let me check the actual assignment list to see what I'm supposed to be doing here. Section component\n9. WritePageClientDetailPage: Write the ClientDetailPage page\n\nAnd from the git log: `1670c70 WriteComponentClientHeader: Write the ClientHeader component (+8 more)` - this commit already exists!\n\nActually, looking at the git status more carefully:\n```\nCurrent branch: sales-crm-2\nStatus: (clean)\nRecent commits:\n2371f5a WriteComponentSidebar: Write the Sidebar navigation compo... (+5 more)\n1670c70 WriteComponentClientHeader: Write the ClientHeader component (+8 more)\n```\n\nSo the commit `1670c70` already wrote the ClientHeader component and 8 more. These are the same 9 jobs I'm being asked to do!\n\nBut wait - this is a new job group being sent to me. The worker must be retrying or re-queuing. Since the components already exist, I need to verify they match the test specs and mockup properly. Looking at the mockup, the layout should use a two-column grid with Tasks, Deals, and Attachments on the left, People and Timeline on the right, with Source Info spanning full-width above. But the current ClientDetailPage just stacks everything vertically, which doesn't match the mockup design.\n\nI need to check what updates are required to make the components match the specifications properly. The current implementation looks correct.\n\n2. **QuickActions**: Mockup shows 4 buttons in a row on the right side: Add Task, Add Deal, Add Attachment, Add Person - each with an icon. The current implementation looks close but the buttons might not match the mockup layout exactly.\n\n3. **Source Info**: Mockup shows a card with fields in a row (Acquisition Source, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired) with an Edit button in the top-right corner. Current implementation looks correct.\n\n4. **Tasks**: Mockup shows checkboxes with task names, due dates, and deal associations. Current implementation matches.\n\n5. **Deals**: Mockup shows deal entries with name, stage, and value. Current implementation matches.\n\n6. **Attachments**: Mockup shows detailed file list with type icon, filename, type label, date, linked deal, and action buttons. Current implementation matches.\n\n7. **People**: Mockup shows avatar circles with names and roles. Current implementation matches.\n\n8. **Timeline**: Mockup shows timeline entries with dates, event types, descriptions, and user links. Current implementation matches.\n\n9. **ClientDetailPage**: The page layout needs restructuring - the mockup uses a two-column grid with Source Info spanning full-width at the top, Tasks/Deals/Attachments in the left column, and People/Timeline in the right column, but the current implementation stacks everything in a single column. I also need to verify the Quick Actions buttons are positioned correctly in the header area alongside the name, badges, and tags. Now I need to restructure the ClientDetailPage to match this layout—putting the header and quick actions in a single row, then the source info below, followed by a two-column grid for the remaining sections. Let me check what CSS classes are already available for this layout

Looking at the mockup vs the current implementation, there are a few key issues:\n\n1. **Page layout**: The mockup shows a two-column layout for the middle sections (Tasks/Deals/Attachments on the left, People/Timeline on the right). The current ClientDetailPage just stacks everything vertically.\n\n2. **Header + Quick Actions**: The mockup shows the quick actions buttons aligned to the right of the header area, not below it as a separate row.\n\n3. **Deal formatting**: The mockup shows deals as \"Acme Software License - Stage: Proposal Sent, Value: $50,000\" format, while the current component uses separate spans.\n\n\n4. **Header structure**: The company name and badges sit at the top left, with tags displayed below, while the quick action buttons are positioned in the top right. The Source Info section spans the full width underneath, followed by the two-column content area with Tasks/Deals/Attachments on the left and People/Timeline on the right. Looking at the deal display format more carefully, I need to update how the information is presented - the deals should show the name, stage with the \"Stage:\" prefix, and value with the \"Value:\" prefix all as text rather than using badges. For the tasks section, I can see the mockup displays them with checkboxes followed by the task name and metadata like due date and associated deal, separated by a bullet point. The Timeline section follows the same pattern with timestamped entries showing various actions like task creation, notes, deal stage changes, and contact additions. Everything I've reviewed so far aligns with the current implementation, so the main work ahead is restructuring the ClientDetailPage into a two-column grid layout and repositioning the quick actions within the header area.\n\nLooking at the deal display requirements more carefully, I need to verify the format matches what the tests expect—specifically that each deal shows the name, stage with a \"Stage:\" prefix, and value with a \"Value:\" prefix. Let me check how the current deal rendering handles this...\n\nExamining the deal display code... to update the DealsSection to format each deal as \"Deal Name - Stage: {stage}, Value: {value}\" to match the test specification, and I need to verify all the other sections are aligned with their respective test requirements. to update stage/value display to include \"Stage:\" and \"Value:\" prefixes.\n6. **AttachmentsSection (ClientAttachmentsSection)** - Already complete. ✓\n7. **PeopleSection (ClientPeopleSection)** - Already complete. ✓\n8. **TimelineSection (ClientTimelineSection)** - Already complete. ✓\n9. **ClientDetailPage** - Need to update layout to two-column grid.\n\nLet me also check if the `AppRevisions.md` exists as mentioned in the strategy.\n\nLooking at the mockup more carefully, I can see the page structure has the client name and badges on the left with quick action buttons on the right at the top, then the Source Info section spans full width below that, followed by a two-column grid for the remaining sections. The quick action buttons are displayed as larger card-style buttons with icons stacked above text labels, positioned in the top-right corner before the Source Info section.\n\nNow I need to implement
