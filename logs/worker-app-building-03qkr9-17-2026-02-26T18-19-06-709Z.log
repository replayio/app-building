This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify).

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_011maZSNUrCzbcnue5EVuXop","session_id":"9b072fb8-44f1-480a-90bb-ff636e9bf5a7","uuid":"75a2dd8a-1385-40ec-bd1d-2c6c4d27940f"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   153→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   154→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   155→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   156→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_011maZSNUrCzbcnue5EVuXop","session_id":"9b072fb8-44f1-480a-90bb-ff636e9bf5a7","uuid":"f387399d-f6a8-466b-8d69-048cd15d9634"}

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_011maZSNUrCzbcnue5EVuXop","session_id":"9b072fb8-44f1-480a-90bb-ff636e9bf5a7","uuid":"7089c3d2-9f2b-4c8b-b83d-ae65cd3b0da2"}

Now I have a clear picture. Let me summarize what needs to be done for each subtask:\n\n**Subtask 1: FixViolation: Add test entries for AccountCard three-dot menu individual actions**\nThe testSpec.md (tests.md) has a test for \"AccountCard three-dot menu opens actions\" which checks that the menu opens with Edit Account, Delete Account, View Transactions. But according to the testSpec.md directive \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result\" and \"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects\", we need individual test entries for:\n\n\n- Edit Account action (clicking it should navigate to account detail page)\n- View Transactions action (clicking it should navigate to account detail page)\n- Delete Account action (clicking it should delete the account, verify persistence)\n\nThese individual action tests are MISSING from tests.md. I need to add them.\n\n**Subtask 2: FixViolation: Fix incorrect Assets category total**\nLooking at the seed data, I can see the three accounts with their balances and need to verify the total matches what's in tests.md.\n\n**Subtask 3: FixViolation: Fix NavBar Log Out to properly terminate session**\nThe NavBar component is just redirecting to /login without actually clearing the auth state. According to the test spec, the session needs to be terminated, so I need to update the NavBar to dispatch a logout action or clear auth state before navigating.\n\n**Subtask 4: RunTests: Verify tests pass after fixes**\n\nNow I'm going to start implementing these changes. Let me examine the relevant files more carefully to understand what needs to be updated.","signature":"Er0QCkYICxgCKkBQayk1zK3IYBOT4iS9IEC64RvbWQxvTATJ5S35xjF6DVs5UPtAplAjN7UIJ5g31+NVwVcLfVlPgB5fYYMBcbRPEgwRCWe/XSrXd2yQursaDCgW7H69bv3IxlsW2CIwTNEx1M/DF/5Q/ohwEead6y4ZyB9kmYHCu31FZLwTJv/QJ+kmsBd9yNnfy0MPT3v9KqQPE8xbRZgdzeszS4fd14FndsJ2tqiatryrN7dIHng5UUI/Id6XU4DQvoq07YT9XJ1zRR+ib90sA6D0p+/b6Mc5oA/OuKCo9YMwo3CPfHmqkjM4GQKTAn8UHVGq13aPzmLRHJQUNf5TUjGVScepFqYSUN5sJjxP22DFePff1Aj0nljkcQCo/FRIy19MDx8QWk2jrIcvg3kRPkxMFf85s8v1fTwpNuR6H/rjwp4chHuCAsmSqjzyzpYeaqHId82K4HxDtNJs2SRWwiVUCSVX0QeKNcQsmdmZleoXYKqXz5UIreX3svLig0zJG5SwlOveVXqkZppp/hmpmfF+KaPUBCwHNitPaj4pQJtF5WltVvYDyE/OhgBQssC8boT+7it3kDJm5eUBvv8LViL4aif5MEsFUviB6vJSStzr9p4jTtopE3oPIjxHKEBy+hTVGXUwzfM5e4UPF3v9m8r7msc0f3Asyg7p4NXdzzwBJMXWiIUgIVoO3n0tc4whTKfd5MnbWULv61LjqCgDcveXRXyu4zobsh6NgjNtNvciGf5jKLyoVxFze5E/kqdR2MryaiZWtKjtw7/zwBzCm6scz/JMOTxTFGtMeqkOuDHvg9H9vUFZ6reHQYlMuYIFXNgxfaguajIT10G1PKT7Ewu1LXUpItL8REzUoZ+//oyyq0ThKjzPx2cL43jEyt9vYI0tkagFldAway6yC2rz8o7renKssXWRFR4ckFDqL5L5xW44S+l6BOswlkmZ4LV1zPxE4jD9rv64BHFzPSSjbStKFQFrtZRX3x4oFxSQyAb23Gs1Nl37xGQfgjTyRlxyOY8G+HKrGUkaFOYrn//w/T11yy5HHDSVj5Yp3hT3LiYX+PnNhjjB6gFL47CuYplqmiP2PoL7VRzMhcd8JhvrS/LQzu49aTe6FLxKoFiDRDf/mIMAo9RnwVr48PLrD3O6uKzYdq39+EsAZZWXh2KAs7iIdx9wOZ/njHe+210ZZSOtlrGBgtDsUPfSqKTjixe/LrGvQ9fjlhAv8yYDxOiCzEs1hpwi6Ak/0AOcSzhRS0ZNIOzDsYTD98UVZHIOmB8uOuDdMQLW8iqcjWdh4vc0ZIg5HBxKZaBdDItoixdMlNtxkPgLtCIcq4wWB+I8wB/VrMcdc4L03LK3hFr0noJsLoetzGYfxrGhh4UhgpB2mGjwJoctHxxTNT0jiUg2WodwaFBnVS82BGtZqkcZTqSONIOuL3BStUbZRGesen/0ArC57tE1eEHRjAPtSk+WgwA7xmxuJkBMaNRKmmoeyNmFsFyMN9wBay8cgTqntvvfxJe7vSnXpu/JlN+S6yhfR+TtxiR/NTBgaE7MnIwTI5+s3ZM6GFX8YGdpTgbQ5vUblYKhFshtoBRGEAF/bQ1aHMMkMX08bbDgN5vQcSn2XMbz/nGtkDtwCBqTNyyNX2Kod0MRvv8scvssvpY91ElUs3I3g9DU5FCOh0M+W4YKmm1VFf8YpIHt+ZOmXVLWNtGrLuXmUx4eyg8fHjpkJ9d3j+CgooUfFD1UZiGd3vwcJ+yHMqxS5985i7FJZe7tA3ar23CNRatNZ+/wV7rM1KMaVg1aDjWH81j5Iru3vt/X3EldmWsMwyBUrErNxKe3hMEr9ZkQP/Jpi6URZKY8PAh5xOsVSEey4Dk3B5apwtWDuufn30MhPVH71Ewio9Mc8+WM/oRpjzEfJn4/dYN/PqCTUhvMSWq/lmM/yT4Zv88Mc8rT1T4DHN6l/kXgz/WHIWes5ay/wMxMWJ6cpPek2ZkPyfHoBso0+PNvVIUA9DcSP2hoqT53TQiL5efvepnqa5vHRbLcv10U6Qhk2TaIIliK4VTk+uK8BMgMguKpItWzk7HO6gTX1C8LoRA6MV1EoOU1aJL3Sgxifi/rSBp/UerAPBH0F38PSiPqDyNBlFxgZ6Mu8tLxcuquHsRdMBkylKutKfp12PkHUvtOlNyQRiE0ellLhJuJNdgndLvtVxKxCutMqCQzX/m6D5JfjyncezYMusLz1/RN42gML78hvEEIO6NvINtjMK6mYLgTlDFxk0idWVZxe+ow/ilCjEqfdjmkTmQUa4gNJOKFrT5gQJ6DWYmhZTgwRgS9+9XuA0aKl0u5fbvxWImB0cyG1Ab1UFun5DiTQTKLS8I6spioZ1CAvjWCnxHUh+XgIm7P/SEOFWHJCjwpMiz9u0eEnD632cZppBrKMgBer8jbF4oKsTm03/XwxYjdns5j6SX4suauySIAfia1sYKXTAnK99FF3ly8FFtaeTYpp3yhMEwBL1dokOlPtYEKmZvuZX8fLCCHQgiJ73naAQmAaVIcXrQu13ez5h5yIo3JrL8EpftpFzkggRN3bqjPUs+r/8nwTJ8aUTcgq06vXcZVSW83D83j++mHS5LaHZYSh5XsMF0CzR3ypo8H0h+FAvhaWmFB/KrIWUuu5PXUSLnEBmAz+tKI3Mx7r5nt/CSGzZ6Wgx9bBth/yGbCyWQHWiRvk3u4zTt9FCJyaCYwN6bXWZRrmI7B/h9lgh2fT3iuDR3hejJHUzUNyAPhOLL4pb8uKZhnyeu9idI6vwYYPYUvFMbseENhAqN20KLWxl32k8rrhbuPIGSbGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3642,"cache_read_input_tokens":42373,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3642,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9b072fb8-44f1-480a-90bb-ff636e9bf5a7","uuid":"a4e4650c-1e2c-480e-85da-f55609bcd66e"}

The text or its background may use a distinct color (e.g., red tint or a badge) to differentiate it from Credit entries.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable Credit type displays with distinct styling**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with both Debit and Credit transactions visible.\n- **Action:** User observes the Type column for a Credit transaction (e.g., \"Salary Deposit\").\n- **Expected:** The Type column displays the text \"Credit\" for the transaction. The text or its background may use a distinct color (e.g., green tint or a badge) to differentiate it from Debit entries.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable Tags column displays tag chips**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with transactions that have tags.\n- **Action:** User observes the Tags column for a transaction with tags (e.g., \"Rent Payment\" with tags \"Housing\" and \"Recurring\").\n- **Expected:** The Tags column displays the tags as small chips/badges (e.g., \"Housing\", \"Recurring\"). Each tag chip has a colored background to visually distinguish it.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable Tags column empty for untagged transactions**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with transactions that have no tags.\n- **Action:** User observes the Tags column for a transaction without tags.\n- **Expected:** The Tags column is empty or displays a dash/placeholder for transactions that have no tags/categories assigned.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable empty state when no transactions exist**\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to the TransactionsPage and no transactions have been recorded yet.\n- **Action:** User observes the table area.\n- **Expected:** An empty state message is displayed (e.g., \"No transactions found\") indicating that no transactions have been recorded. The NewTransactionButton is still accessible to create the first transaction.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable empty state when filters produce no results**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with filters applied that match no transactions (e.g., AccountFilter set to a newly created account with no transactions).\n- **Action:** User observes the table area.\n- **Expected:** An empty state message is displayed (e.g., \"No transactions found matching your filters\") indicating no transactions match the current filter criteria. The filter controls remain accessible so the user can adjust or clear them.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable updates after saving a new transaction**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with existing transactions listed.\n- **Action:** User clicks the NewTransactionButton, fills in the NewTransactionModal with a new transaction (date: \"Nov 1, 2023\", description: \"Office Supplies\", account: Checking Account, type: Debit, amount: $75.00), and clicks \"Save Transaction\".\n- **Expected:** After the modal closes, the TransactionsTable updates to include the new \"Office Supplies\" transaction. The new row appears in the correct position based on the current sort order (e.g., at the top if sorted by date descending). The Pagination total updates to reflect the additional transaction.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable updates after editing a transaction**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage. User clicks on the \"Grocery Store\" row to open it in the NewTransactionModal, changes the description to \"Grocery Store - Weekly\", and clicks \"Save Transaction\".\n- **Action:** User observes the TransactionsTable after the modal closes.\n- **Expected:** The \"Grocery Store\" row now displays the updated description \"Grocery Store - Weekly\". No duplicate row is created. All other columns remain unchanged.\n\n#### Component: Pagination\n\n**Test: Pagination displays below the TransactionsTable**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with more transactions than fit on a single page (e.g., more than 10 or 20 transactions depending on page size).\n- **Action:** User observes the area below the TransactionsTable.\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are displayed below the table, showing the current page number, total pages, and navigation buttons. The controls include: a previous page button (left arrow), page number indicators, and a next page button (right arrow). A label such as \"Page 1 of 5\" or \"Showing 1–20 of 95 transactions\" is displayed.\n\n**Test: Pagination navigates to the next page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1 of transactions with pagination controls visible.\n- **Action:** User clicks the next page button (right arrow).\n- **Expected:** The TransactionsTable updates to display the next set of transaction rows (page 2). The pagination label updates to reflect the current page (e.g., \"Page 2 of 5\"). The previous page button becomes enabled. The page scrolls to the top of the table.\n\n**Test: Pagination navigates to the previous page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on page 2 of the TransactionsPage table.\n- **Action:** User clicks the previous page button (left arrow).\n- **Expected:** The TransactionsTable updates to display the first set of transaction rows (page 1). The pagination label updates to reflect page 1. The previous page button becomes disabled since the user is on the first page.\n\n**Test: Pagination previous button disabled on first page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1.\n- **Action:** User observes the previous page button.\n- **Expected:** The previous page button (left arrow) is disabled/grayed out, indicating there is no previous page to navigate to.\n\n**Test: Pagination next button disabled on last page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing the last page of transactions (e.g., page 5 of 5).\n- **Action:** User observes the next page button.\n- **Expected:** The next page button (right arrow) is disabled/grayed out, indicating there is no next page to navigate to.\n\n**Test: Pagination clicking a specific page number navigates to that page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1 with page number indicators visible (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n- **Action:** User clicks the page number \"3\".\n- **Expected:** The TransactionsTable updates to display the transactions for page 3. The page number \"3\" is highlighted/active. The pagination label updates to reflect page 3.\n\n**Test: Pagination updates when filters change result count**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 3 of 5 pages of transactions.\n- **Action:** User applies a filter (e.g., selects \"Checking Account (Chase Bank)\" in the AccountFilter) that reduces the total results to a single page.\n- **Expected:** The Pagination resets to page 1. The page number indicators update to show fewer pages (e.g., \"Page 1 of 1\"). The previous and next buttons are both disabled since all filtered results fit on one page.\n\n**Test: Pagination hidden when all transactions fit on one page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with very few transactions (e.g., 5 transactions when page size is 20).\n- **Action:** User observes the area below the TransactionsTable.\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are either hidden or displayed in a minimal state (e.g., \"Page 1 of 1\") since all transactions fit on a single page. The previous and next buttons are both disabled.\n\n#### Component: NewTransactionButton\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton displays with plus icon and text**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage.\n- **Action:** User observes the top-right area of the page header, to the right of the filter bar.\n- **Expected:** A \"New Transaction\" button is displayed with a blue/primary filled style. The button shows a plus icon (+) followed by the text \"New Transaction\". The button is prominently positioned for easy access.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton opens NewTransactionModal**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"New Transaction\" button.\n- **Expected:** The NewTransactionModal dialog opens, overlaying the TransactionsPage. The modal is in new transaction mode with empty fields (date defaulting to today, empty description, default currency USD, two empty line item rows). The user can fill in the transaction details and save.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton saving transaction updates table**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage and clicks the \"New Transaction\" button. The NewTransactionModal opens. User fills in: date \"Nov 5, 2023\", description \"Monthly Subscription\", selects \"Checking Account\" with Debit type and amount $15.99, selects \"Expenses\" with Credit type and amount $15.99, adds tag \"Recurring\".\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Save Transaction\" in the modal.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. The TransactionsPage returns to view. The new \"Monthly Subscription\" transaction appears in the TransactionsTable with the correct date, description, account, type, amount, and \"Recurring\" tag. The Pagination total updates to include the new transaction.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton cancelling does not affect table**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with a known set of transactions. User clicks the \"New Transaction\" button and begins filling in fields.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Cancel\" in the NewTransactionModal.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. The TransactionsTable remains unchanged with the same transactions as before the modal was opened. No new transaction is created.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":73,"oldLines":7,"newStart":73,"newLines":7,"lines":[" **Test: CategorySection shows correct category totals**"," - **Initial state:** User is on the AccountsPage with seeded account data."," - **Action:** User observes the category headers.","-- **Expected:** Each category header displays the sum of all account balances in that category.

This seems like a data contamination issue from other tests running in parallel (the Delete Account test might be affecting totals). Or the seed data has different values than expected.\n\n2. **AccountCard Delete Account menu action removes account** - The card is still visible after clicking Delete. The error log shows a foreign key constraint violation: `delete on table \"accounts\" violates foreign key constraint \"transaction_entries_account_id_fkey\" on table \"transaction_entries\"`. So the delete is failing because there are transaction entries referencing this account.\n\n\nThe first failure with the category totals looks like it might be pre-existing and unrelated to my changes, possibly caused by parallel test execution contaminating the data. The second failure is clearer—the delete operation is being blocked by foreign key constraints since transaction entries still reference the account being deleted. The CategorySection test failure looks like data contamination from other tests running in the same worker, which is a pre-existing issue unrelated to my changes. For the Delete Account test, the backend is rejecting deletion because of foreign key constraints from existing transactions, so I need to either modify the delete endpoint to cascade deletions or adjust the test to work within that constraint. Let me check the delete endpoint implementation to see what approach makes sense.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3988,"cache_read_input_tokens":66325,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3988,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9b072fb8-44f1-480a-90bb-ff636e9bf5a7","uuid":"b13a6824-e5fd-4b64-96ea-0d16340d5fd4"}

It simply tries to `DELETE FROM accounts WHERE id = ${id}` without first deleting related transaction entries. I need to fix this by deleting related transaction entries first.\n\nFor the CategorySection totals test, the issue is that the Expenses total is `$77,100.00` instead of `$55,500.00`. This is likely a pre-existing issue caused by parallel test data contamination. But I didn't change this test - this might have been failing before too. Let me check the test more carefully... Actually, this could be because other tests (like the New Transaction test running in parallel) might have created new expense transactions that changed the totals.\n \nThe totals test failure is probably due to test isolation issues with parallel execution sharing the same database within a worker. I should verify whether this test was actually passing before my changes, since the git log shows everything was clean. The test code already had specific expected values like `$150,950.00` for Assets, so if the totals are off now, something's definitely contaminating the test data. The Delete Account test is actually failing due to a foreign key constraint—the deletion never went through, so the data shouldn't have changed at all. The Expenses total discrepancy is strange since this test was passing before, but given the parallel test execution, I'm wondering if the new transaction modal test on the same worker is creating extra expense entries. I need to fix the Delete Account issue first by ensuring related transaction entries are deleted before removing the account, then re-run to see if that resolves the flakiness.\n\nDeleting transaction

This was probably a pre-existing flaky test. Let me think about what could cause `$77,100.00` for Expenses instead of `$55,500.00`.\n\nActually, wait - the delete test deletes the \"Checking Account (Chase Bank)\" which is an Assets account. But the delete test also deletes the transaction_entries for that account. The transaction_entries contain debit and credit entries for transactions. Deleting those entries might affect the YTD totals that feed into other accounts. But the category totals are based on `accounts.balance`, not on summing transaction entries. Unless the app recalculates balances from transaction entries...\n \nHmm, but the category total is just summing the `balance` column from accounts in that category, so deleting an Assets account shouldn't touch the Expenses totals at all. The discrepancy between the expected `$55,500` and actual `$77,100` suggests the test is picking up extra expense balances - either from previous tests polluting the database, or the seed data isn't what I think it is.\n\nWait, each test run gets its own ephemeral branch with fresh seed data, and with 2 workers running in parallel, each worker has its own isolated branch. So tests shouldn't be leaking data between workers. But if my new Delete Account test is running in the same worker and modifying data before the CategorySection test runs, that could explain it - though it's deleting an Assets account, not an Expenses one, so that shouldn't affect the Expenses total either.\n\nThe $21,600 difference is too large to be from a single transaction my tests created. I'm wondering if this might actually be a pre-existing issue rather than something my changes introduced.\n\nLet me reconsider the test isolation problem. The delete test was failing before due to the foreign key constraint, so the deletion never actually executed and the data stayed intact. Now that I've fixed the FK issue, the delete will actually run. If both tests share the same worker, deleting the Checking Account and its transaction entries could wipe out data that the category totals test depends on.\n\nBut wait—the error shows an Expenses total of $77,100, which doesn't match the seed data ($35,000 + $20,500 = $55,500). That extra $21,600 suggests transactions from another test are bleeding in, though we're only running the one spec file. Let me think about what could be creating these extra expense entries.","signature":"Er8nCkYICxgCKkDulODFxRycbEzCIdbCHdSpp9g/OW/auXU+bZSTjk7Z+V33jNyI+MWABL3Puegglt8pBcZtxBBaaEwKAACS2CTKEgwcEXxJtPfYlaNRp8EaDOzsGNcbv2j9MYREWyIwoJkFXFfWMONgY2E5BYDb9Otbhj76DWr8qC5eWVokY6vT32wvvIsk4ngaxCbRpPzFKqYmL23Z93r09LZTKG01onVezC9ordEQAVYxxaCwYDvvABA4X3A/DYe302XPa88IYs2j0BjahY1GY9gOAv0eU4ZTWljKQkli/WNXkaCufvpxYOK0AjR6TqRATJn+4dTOqjyWPhvK0gA9KHfwxpAVrAzk2l5mYG7Y/0oYAeaHv+CGtyEV5RAMNc/I3PSwu0SX/oQCMAiTrrfa/ZqF9jTnQ6obmTgS6rUmZFD1gh9pN/Jyrh4fC/7iyCYBEiljUkedDX11whY6k0Mwi4yDDng+TID76U7oARG+uK31w/EjyChK8b94eYzaYHo/pVipGbRKWSrF1X347v3p5ESJLcd80j9tmZR0OhQPBf8eFVLNLXoSdScyUASd5QDhSIqec8SPI12V9ti/2TB4pim8AMgPQ6SbZTWpSD1DEIrZFW11x8vDpSanrhkvRgY1GGWehDk26A5QFS5gudWY1Viz1gd/OdrMfIrEQgDHRQ26C3jYYM/7Yb04idXLxPlWnR/Hx32x4Cly84gs66DDqnE1pMw4y5QtisP8btH57GIz51hwV2SpTv8ZTRQ8+uwrre1MsEn2NVfUmzJF3Y6M40/omdqpHj4LizbY21bno+wQ+M+I/JesfyK1N2d79wH7RarW1/dizDJgb4S7vTb/WIXCPPvdXT0eg/LZ/uXs+9M9BI7fzk9nDINEg45iZfW4jUO9goIrGcSRAOsSr1fN2/d788tu1/prYRmJciZaqNfG9Y0dcI7Fs600wGuJjmiwo3tqBhFBevlfD+oFzWLdGCuwu4Qdwe5wcBQn0KVrxME0tqwYkDH8GCnANMnpDMsOWKTk1+TtIQ16w1jfOem6l9PcKAY+f5AreNtVq9/Q1w9ziPn0JsicxyY8DD0dhFOAcYj+rvDuL5+hOneCzDgu/vG4vlD5lF01MuSi2Hg9DXbtP88KVUOlfyH1WHc9W0nMQc1cllPD1TDGAKNak9k/pYtVehGf+SE6Y8R1C8OKKh/3HMdOqo8ihOipUSgo7x/1SNHN7U40S4oUP73k+XkdEQMzvMwPR03EWCVZCRolHlazEZexsEWaERLQGfLAO4VCCqjIUiTQIb+3pBrZMDWeqF4gXZZFj3Wss5+F8fhYPP/9jX4CmfeyMs+HVoWe1qhM/w0nwJRa7hdv9QKea6DzCDx1/Omh+Ele06jShhyJa7ahs6L7s0p/NkmXST3Vt4PgqDOxEJXswC+a9tg8fNrd2usZf4XaTbgpFyFtcEQPDhqGMpzGqZsmIzkCQItzErf33rcIGLmp3GRHGmso67/KZ9J9BMP16T+Zbpo6iRFZ+lUVO8gl+vZFreGlq4j2etzETXx/dmKJm3/evb3USNu25YRroobd7790KRPIzxt9ZuIJyAhpEKBwiRaxWmRjHLzuIq8a/HqxmgVZ9crXfkvE8pBncFkgNUj97/2/l0KqKeXLZc2ooxVi35JSfKqJgNnKu8GKqFeutwrqduOUd5ve1SU9ULwV1eFAaHlu/20J5V6qulc3MGfgBSOKEKmwegT+BAk2xknoEKhbvO6Nl7GvRxQ5oPGlWJU6CuV9dF5VgDgq/z2sz28AoXlEORzVyq+0RA0mSFbpi3MyOEGJn0ypwLXEAplzBMit1Jq5gqjHtz7F/NJ/GNGcLd7aKkizSbUOmbVCHo8XXoB+VU770IbtaCqAEf4bVvZjHUarghW6qpeDFXYiRGxx5qSOx1QZ+OR+/f+xZ6uua5XmO5xKrih7WG19VV9cgFcaBDHw4hmfkjRYJ1bBh9VccUXflXL20ZZqCJtyturW+MYbtyprrzvVSSQ9wAOGcYWs79cwjCXRqk+dhqo8zFHxunj6d3EMTLoaCREELEGjU3UE71NX3z9z++vbms22bQvhVr12E8P4p14wJb2QAPRL6OiGlLGPKMCpOA0eNDzaWMo7FgX3+zHQRSEl22iUK4acg1kO755MZcTaKGq/+fmn3LOrjy/HMLk4S2QGV/km4IkxK5xXS4zDnjZ/Wqdzw63IYSz8bN9mI+qXqpO864PyWrSBxi+FAWwhDEl0mO/e24DFJ7+Q1jzUl5cwBfAra8DzzGL3CfktiUtJ55T/6TK6CwtBJHyf7Whc2YV0WzPiIyvn+RB9HRKd4DKjTVMa9QhxhG0iOSFo8IU9Z/B/zw0r/0+uEf6qJSgdCkr5ukSNJCOLe3/DdnW0IUuj2tJzbTowo02OFrE8BG99mh4rJIzDWa04WAJdSc4qogQrH6cieRc4VpqadoH1hU9n/LFwMwHux5MCOfCqdxnlfDNcy+lHmE398KWaKX5TVi7UXmqRJ7P5nQalxHA+9a3NEjtSNDNNpzRmxhoOy01NrT22q9+nx5th3qv6y2bmibIld5LTmivh1QIWjlapcv6SfHYRifCxGtkv6V2ww/SpsleK+W0ZG+7617X4nScg9emrMUjaTV6gMxsJsAwRlwPsLRwR61NrRSzaFqWJiKlSoQo+RWVl96jMsH1jNZRgFQEHXsMuMPzym3vvDofML/XcchyJa32ErZXspg6ybDeGvG6NM0/OpW+br9BAbgSXv2YnR6AHR07BZ6VLYhChmrKxphWxZvJC/zV1j3eiMrKqEqmoPJLCuCnnNnT3QPfFxRyHEvupoAsoddRS8GfOM/2BI3WQ0YVQzgUZkZumurcYAgEEKDNMdzDST84UGxGxlPHNl7WIPNNiubsErlDy4kW1p15/E3TmJItDkZ2chiqcZagBVkDTwA7SFI3OJDXHsC/pzDPnGcyT4kK4DtBj0a+F9fVdHqpTURRQGdqcbxR6ZKoTOJUiEky8qTvvWtZvh65RmDH1UqI9FybgKNvuREknHct872EFcTLsI9IQEovmsHvX297hIEUbDY74T0FCesPie0srRJt27cG0WOaHpLW+6ybyH0qKpxVx7+X61cP0G3Pojzk54c0EIPRAF1CW5UXCDeHUiVhIvG8CejgYDoRpz+q/bFSy9S95Fc7BDU4wem/BpPxRePYb8ID/5DOhKr+BuzNAwNHveeS/XUxsxN2mmO2GW47x4QL+qjxJ+yuCU7k99yvMI9pv150wfOUxMHfBIP8lWMytQ3wS8ggPfjLEoojBmmnL4gbdMXR3r5cuTZ3LhIqZVfV3fg/cfM+2aEl7ivdtvXddjg/HveeDyjLMuSe5o3B9AlQ9tGQqQIP7rTtHblZ52B0Lz4iNcoPk/B1OHfBr1zTsk6NbWiiq8RwtVAkLFSlz/t/Ztp8DE/ZCSTveSnJ2Yzly+W2TR+zFe+XTkc61xJnRtQrYvHt7NZY9YnHoWMH+HRAK7yUCQ1qNZDW2wWvctQ3nQXrOj7/YAHqYU2cDtKC1DtJBOEbQKO97CBpDUcUKuVX7Q/MoHmgJSCyUn/E5iLOSUpeXYyoZgCuo89WbgU0LXFRmZ33Omp+sNF4uXSXtnHYUG28KzPwjVhT68NOZYUYpbgKMOQNivYGPwHlwkaw73tqJ+udl0paXnxrIAeqnRRxJqg8uDsiiatB86ZVpQoXpYXNM+Ar0R0ffZYbpQwI8rGAbdVbsD+2fkVBXglH3HojiPDRAg7zmQi3TDq5PNcLCjAcqMroiEGu3wamD1OAtEW60GI/3r0cDd2fhz+TPc0U/AL4vtoDH5ufnel5G+d/ZQLErsDbkFZ5d9CwhXOvm+DDnf37W81frmoU5jRyUPihLPl/+fweQTBI0B40mlwSvpPnvLdknTN/TAZTvjfiUe5otNAPXSkSyghe6szhxrNeOJnCkQjIGQalRYyP3jGYvPqECzxpkhTFgQ7jvUQbo5dMhmnMHrOCIIFS98X4OVsNDVNk7L4LqzgrARF3tmyrcWS0er0ITy5XkE+dwubXIiWk1Omn0AwSDbNZSU0LlmmG8242guxRA8DODOq6Ox/OahWWQLnxI+kBZ5/m0QfIwdONO7Osme0QUEY3pgOU0l2jbt+zMt/oNAGEMPZu+V9SC+f2ASGCx0eusbyhH/P0oRt7CdgDGXx8l00kCxaEkAZcPPkhc3BB9hzpuaAqfjJ4DIm64/gn0eQBQmrl9vhYlGhu5RRgxJEUq4XWUFeJrOIz2h3RdSi/imP00owZwR0JxxgJtbEEfeXWZSpblYJL96QzBRyHt8rKC4ataGUjYQe/HiB7B8EJiwkMNxivmEgn/M5n0D7C24xkdHw9OWv81vZsf527JjVUk+5NXjZ1VaCBfOWm++6YyH2xfaKW53/+/pypRq1IaPHfpwZboaV2/tkY15RnaL4ySfGTXCGX3ZdV17Wk7QiuIPzFqLGRRS3tllvQ71t0Fvjw7ph70KHsp9NOiRiHr2wHVFZ1MZ/kk+rQb/VprQUL2vOeLcXdvRSsaYfvfrYLFe/TAdSQmFEatxmy6ZsRqDoJQamL0g0cDw/KFqIUUJLzmi5POGFw4tnFVarzbk36RWw9E81Btfn/jRrG0x5LxL81IdpMBvQx5BFCE2uZawuhkDODcW7hI8i4GuiHGmKY4/tVokm/YV5XCMDixCKdyS0P3/ZxefN1GSbUubB0sepd5lUFbUlWQVU8nq9I/SCoAYPRWYUMVWwgclNqIWIrFNdjjAnb4ED33MZbfmOpr3ZRYQTV/SPaJK81XRksN7wxZTlKSy1fakA9pK8GzYyDIfuVMmk3rCRUXTszdxmBXuTQWZQdqHs58ulkRFz8CFpx0Zmy4ZLz2lC6Ek3GXoyQzV8CS1F4R+NhTr9X5AQLwGsqX5fDIhLNrexyS6jBH7Q3utsg5E14qCtdAHEl5RGD+aQs0kjuwwvHYaLSuRbH+PYFzl

The Delete Account test now passes (27 passed). But two issues:\n\n1. **CategorySection shows correct category totals** - Still failing with Expenses at $77,100.00 instead of $55,500.00. This is consistently failing with the same value. Let me investigate this more deeply.\n\n2. **AccountCard click navigates to AccountDetailPage** - This test tries to click on \"Checking Account (Chase Bank)\" which was already deleted by the Delete Account test running on the same worker! This is a data contamination issue within the same worker.\n\nFor issue #2, I need to ensure the \"click navigates\" test doesn't depend on data that the delete test removes. \n\nThe Delete Account test (test 25) ran on the same worker as the click navigates test (test 26), deleting \"Checking Account (Chase Bank)\" before the click test could use it. I could fix this by having the delete test target a different account instead, or by having the click test verify a different account that won't be affected by the deletion.\n\nThe real issue is that the test spec explicitly requires using the Checking Account's three-dot menu, but running this destructive test in parallel with other tests that depend on that account creates a race condition. Since tests need to run concurrently, I should modify the Delete Account test to create and delete its own temporary test account instead of using the shared Checking Account. Looking at the dependency map, \"Investment Portfolio (Vanguard)\" would conflict with the investment performance test, and \"Savings Account (Ally)\" would affect the savings goal test. The liability accounts seem like a better option since fewer tests depend on them, though I need to verify that the liability tests don't all check the same accounts. The real issue here is test isolation—I should either pick an account that genuinely has no other test dependencies, or create a brand new test account specifically for the delete operation. I need to pick an account for the delete test that won't break other tests—the Car Loan seems like the safest choice since it's only checked for its balance in the liability test. I'll update both the test spec and the implementation to use Car Loan instead of Checking Account, which keeps the delete test isolated from the click navigation test that already uses Checking Account.\n\nNow I'm looking at the CategorySection totals issue—the Expenses category is showing $77,100.00 when it should be $55,500.00, which is a $21,600 discrepancy. Let me trace through the seed data to figure out where these extra expense transactions are coming

[2026-02-26T17:56:05.532Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Xi8sKRf1FfiFMSo86sNvQX","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I see the issue clearly!\n\nThe seed data has FOUR expense accounts:\n1. Operating Expenses: $35,000.00\n2. Payroll Expenses: $20,500.00\n3. Rent Expense: $18,000.00\n4. Utilities Expense: $3,600.00\n\nTotal: 35,000 + 20,500 + 18,000 + 3,600 = **$77,100.00**\n\nSo the tests.md and the test both have the wrong expected value! The test expects $55,500.00 (which is only 35,000 + 20,500), but the actual total is $77,100.00 because there are two more expense accounts seeded (Rent Expense and Utilities Expense).\n\n\nI need to update both the test assertion and the documentation to reflect the correct total of $77,100.00. For the second issue, the \"click navigates to AccountDetailPage\" test is failing because the Delete Account test is removing the Checking Account that the navigation test depends on. I'll fix the test isolation by having the Delete Account test remove a different account like the Car Loan instead.\n\nBut wait—looking at which accounts are actually tested individually, the Car Loan shows up in the liability test too, so that could still cause interference. I need to find an account that isn't being checked by any other test to avoid cascading failures across the test suite. Looking at the expense accounts that aren't individually tested, I could use Rent Expense for the delete test since it's isolated from other AccountCard tests. But that creates a problem—if the delete test runs and removes the $18,000 Rent Expense entry, it'll throw off the CategorySection totals test which expects the full Expenses category sum. The real solution is to ensure tests don't interfere with each other's data expectations.\n\nI'm weighing a few approaches: creating a unique test account within the delete test itself for true isolation, running the delete test in its own isolated block, or adjusting the test spec to be more flexible about which account gets deleted. Given the testing guidelines that say data-modifying tests should operate on their own isolated records, the cleanest fix is to have the delete test create its own account first, then delete it through the UI rather than relying on existing test data.\n\nBut I'm realizing the real bottleneck here is that tests run in parallel, so I can't control ordering or guarantee which accounts other tests have already touched. The practical solution is to pick an account that's less likely to be individually tested—something like \"Car Loan\" in Liabilities—and then adjust any liability-specific tests to either skip that account or verify it exists before checking it.\n\n, looking at this more carefully, the Playwright tests with `fullyParallel: true` and 2 workers means tests from the same describe block can run on different workers. Each worker has its own database branch, so they shouldn't interfere with each other. But the test run shows the Delete test passed while the click test failed, and examining the worker distribution reveals the Delete test ran on Worker 1 while the click test ran on Worker 2.\n\nThe real problem is that both tests are trying to interact with \"Checking Account (Chase Bank)\" — the delete test removes it, then the click test can't find it. The quickest solution would be to swap the click test to use \"Savings Account (Ally)\" instead, but I'm hesitant to modify existing tests without good reason.\n\nActually, the better approach is to make my delete test self-contained by having it create its own account via the API first, then delete that account through the UI. That way it won't interfere with any pre-existing test

The delete test needs to first expand a category before finding the account card. Let me take the simplest approach that works:\n\n1. The delete test should expand the Expenses category, then delete \"Utilities Expense\" (the last expense account, $3,600). No other test individually checks this account.\n2. Fix the expenses total to $77,100.003. Leave the \"click navigates\" test as-is since it won't be affected.\n\nBut wait - I need to make sure the category totals test isn't affected by deleting Utilities Expense. If both tests run on the same worker, and the delete test runs first, the expenses total would be $77,100 - $3,600 = $73,500. \n\nThat would break the totals test. I'm realizing that any deletion in the same worker will cascade into other tests. My options are limited: I could create a test-specific account via API, use a separate database branch for isolation, or prevent the deletion from persisting—but the spec requires verifying persistence. Looking back at what I actually specified for the delete test, I said it should remove the \"Checking Account (Chase Bank)\" card from Assets, so I need to reconsider whether that's the right account to delete.\n\nThe real issue is test isolation with shared state. The pragmatic fix would be adding a POST endpoint to accounts.ts so the delete test can create its own throwaway account to delete, which is actually a reasonable feature for the app anyway. I could use `page.request` to insert a test account directly via API, then delete it through the UI—but that still requires the POST endpoint. Let me think about whether there's a simpler path forward. me take the simplest pragmatic approach: make the delete test create its own test account via the backend API. I need to add a POST endpoint to accounts.ts.\n\nWait, but the task says I'm fixing violations. Adding a POST endpoint to accounts is a significant new feature. Let me reconsider.\n\nThe simplest approach without adding API features:\n- Change the delete test spec and test to work differently: instead of deleting a specific seeded account, expand a non-default category (expenses) and delete \"Utilities Expense\" ($3,600). Since no individual test checks \"Utilities Expense\", this won't affect other tests.\n- The only potential conflict is with the CategorySection totals test. If they're on the same worker, the totals would change.\n\nI think the real solution is to use the delete test with an account from an expanded category, and accept that the totals test might fail if they're on the same worker. The key insight is that with 2 workers and roughly 29 tests distributed evenly, I can strategically place the delete test near the end to minimize the chance it runs on the same worker as the totals test. tests must be designed to run concurrently. So I need to make the delete test completely isolated—the cleanest approach is to have it create its own account through the API rather than relying on seed data. I could add a POST endpoint to accounts, but that feels like feature work rather than a test fix. Let me think about whether this is justified or if there's a simpler workaround.\n\nActually, adding the POST endpoint is the right call here. It's a natural part of the CRUD operations and solves the isolation problem properly—the test creates a throwaway account, deletes it, and leaves no shared state modified.","signature":"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

The filter controls remain accessible so the user can adjust or clear them.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable updates after saving a new transaction**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with existing transactions listed.\n- **Action:** User clicks the NewTransactionButton, fills in the NewTransactionModal with a new transaction (date: \"Nov 1, 2023\", description: \"Office Supplies\", account: Checking Account, type: Debit, amount: $75.00), and clicks \"Save Transaction\".\n- **Expected:** After the modal closes, the TransactionsTable updates to include the new \"Office Supplies\" transaction. The new row appears in the correct position based on the current sort order (e.g., at the top if sorted by date descending). The Pagination total updates to reflect the additional transaction.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable updates after editing a transaction**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage. User clicks on the \"Grocery Store\" row to open it in the NewTransactionModal, changes the description to \"Grocery Store - Weekly\", and clicks \"Save Transaction\".\n- **Action:** User observes the TransactionsTable after the modal closes.\n- **Expected:** The \"Grocery Store\" row now displays the updated description \"Grocery Store - Weekly\". No duplicate row is created. All other columns remain unchanged.\n\n#### Component: Pagination\n\n**Test: Pagination displays below the TransactionsTable**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with more transactions than fit on a single page (e.g., more than 10 or 20 transactions depending on page size).\n- **Action:** User observes the area below the TransactionsTable.\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are displayed below the table, showing the current page number, total pages, and navigation buttons. The controls include: a previous page button (left arrow), page number indicators, and a next page button (right arrow). A label such as \"Page 1 of 5\" or \"Showing 1–20 of 95 transactions\" is displayed.\n\n**Test: Pagination navigates to the next page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1 of transactions with pagination controls visible.\n- **Action:** User clicks the next page button (right arrow).\n- **Expected:** The TransactionsTable updates to display the next set of transaction rows (page 2).

The previous page button becomes disabled since the user is on the first page.\n\n**Test: Pagination previous button disabled on first page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1.\n- **Action:** User observes the previous page button.\n- **Expected:** The previous page button (left arrow) is disabled/grayed out, indicating there is no previous page to navigate to.\n\n**Test: Pagination next button disabled on last page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing the last page of transactions (e.g., page 5 of 5).\n- **Action:** User observes the next page button.\n- **Expected:** The next page button (right arrow) is disabled/grayed out, indicating there is no next page to navigate to.\n\n**Test: Pagination clicking a specific page number navigates to that page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1 with page number indicators visible (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n- **Action:** User clicks the page number \"3\".\n- **Expected:** The TransactionsTable updates to display the transactions for page 3. The page number \"3\" is highlighted/active. The pagination label updates to reflect page 3.\n\n**Test: Pagination updates when filters change result count**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 3 of 5 pages of transactions.\n- **Action:** User applies a filter (e.g., selects \"Checking Account (Chase Bank)\" in the AccountFilter) that reduces the total results to a single page.\n- **Expected:** The Pagination resets to page 1. The page number indicators update to show fewer pages (e.g., \"Page 1 of 1\"). The previous and next buttons are both disabled since all filtered results fit on one page.\n\n**Test: Pagination hidden when all transactions fit on one page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with very few transactions (e.g., 5 transactions when page size is 20).\n- **Action:** User observes the area below the TransactionsTable.\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are either hidden or displayed in a minimal state (e.g., \"Page 1 of 1\") since all transactions fit on a single page. The previous and next buttons are both disabled.\n\n#### Component: NewTransactionButton\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton displays with plus icon and text**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage.\n- **Action:** User observes the top-right area of the page header, to the right of the filter bar.\n- **Expected:** A \"New Transaction\" button is displayed with a blue/primary filled style. The button shows a plus icon (+) followed by the text \"New Transaction\". The button is prominently positioned for easy access.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton opens NewTransactionModal**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"New Transaction\" button.\n- **Expected:** The NewTransactionModal dialog opens, overlaying the TransactionsPage. The modal is in new transaction mode with empty fields (date defaulting to today, empty description, default currency USD, two empty line item rows). The user can fill in the transaction details and save.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton saving transaction updates table**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage and clicks the \"New Transaction\" button. The NewTransactionModal opens. User fills in: date \"Nov 5, 2023\", description \"Monthly Subscription\", selects \"Checking Account\" with Debit type and amount $15.99, selects \"Expenses\" with Credit type and amount $15.99, adds tag \"Recurring\".\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Save Transaction\" in the modal.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. The TransactionsPage returns to view. The new \"Monthly Subscription\" transaction appears in the TransactionsTable with the correct date, description, account, type, amount, and \"Recurring\" tag. The Pagination total updates to include the new transaction.\n\n**Test: NewTransactionButton cancelling does not affect table**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with a known set of transactions. User clicks the \"New Transaction\" button and begins filling in fields.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Cancel\" in the NewTransactionModal.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. The TransactionsTable remains unchanged with the same transactions as before the modal was opened. No new transaction is created.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":133,"oldLines":9,"newStart":133,"newLines":9,"lines":[" - **Expected:** The app navigates to the AccountDetailPage for the Checking Account.

The test itself doesn't have `test.slow()` and the Replay Chromium browser is 2-3x slower. The test checks 5 categories with 3 assertions each (15 assertions) plus 6 order assertions = 21 assertions. With the Replay browser overhead, this can easily exceed the 60-second default timeout.\n\nSince this is a pre-existing test that was likely on the edge of timing out, and the Delete Account test on the same worker might have added some load, the simplest fix is to add `test.slow()` to this test. Or I could look at whether the delete test (which creates a new account) adds data that causes the category section to render more slowly.\n \nThe test results show significant variance across runs—3.1 seconds, then 56.6 seconds, then timing out at 66 seconds—which points to flakiness rather than a consistent problem. This wide fluctuation suggests something environmental is causing the test to slow down unpredictably.\n\nSince the git status is clean and these tests were passing before, this isn't related to my changes. The issue appears to be the Replay Chromium browser experiencing cold-start or resource contention problems. I'll add `test.slow()` to extend the timeout from 60 seconds to 180 seconds, which should give it enough breathing room to handle the overhead.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":822,"cache_read_input_tokens":97642,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":822,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"9b072fb8-44f1-480a-90bb-ff636e9bf5a7","uuid":"b4e28dd5-a3be-4b8f-87e7-762c789f9940"}
