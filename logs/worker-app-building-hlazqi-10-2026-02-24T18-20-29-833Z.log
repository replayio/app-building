Lost (Q3): 18 ($0.6M) (with an icon)\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md\nJob 2 done. Now Job 3: PlanComponentDealsTableView.\n[TodoWrite]\nFrom the mockup, the table view has:\n- Columns: Deal Name, Client, Stage, Owner, Value, Close Date (with sort arrow ↓), Status\n- Status badges with colors: On Track (blue/teal), Needs Attention (amber/yellow), At Risk (red/pink), Won (green)\n- Three-dot action menu on each row\n- Row click navigates to deal detail\n- Pagination: \"Page 1 of 9\"\n- Close Date sort arrow indicator (from AppRevisions.md)\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md\nJob 3 done. Now Job 4: PlanComponentDealsPipelineView.\n[TodoWrite]\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md\nJob 4 done. Now Job 5: PlanComponentDealsFiltersAndSearch.\n[TodoWrite]\nFrom the mockup, the filter bar contains:\n- Stage: dropdown (All Stages)\n- Client: dropdown (All Clients) - searchable per AppRevisions.md\n- Status: dropdown (Active)\n- Date - Range: date range picker\n- Sort by: dropdown (Close Date (Newest))\n- Search input (search icon + text input)\n\nPer AppRevisions.md, filter dropdowns use custom FilterSelect components (not native HTML select). FilterSelect with many options includes a searchable search input.\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md\nJob 5 done. Now Job 6: PlanComponentCreateDealModal.\n[TodoWrite]\nFrom the mockup, there's a \"Create New Deal\" button in the upper right. The job specifies the modal fields: name, client searchable dropdown, value, stage, owner user dropdown, probability, expected close date, status, validation. From AppRevisions.md, owner field uses a FilterSelect populated from ... (truncated)\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md\nAll 6 jobs are complete. Let me mark the final task as done and verify the file.\n[TodoWrite]\nLet me verify the DealsListPage section looks correct.\n[grep] ^## DealsListPage|^### |^#### \n[grep] ^## DealsListPage|^### Deals|^### CreateDeal|^#### \n[grep] ^## DealsListPage|^Components: DealsSummary|^### Deals|^### CreateDeal\nThe structure looks correct. All 6 jobs are complete:\n\n1. **PlanPageDealsListPage**: Added component list (DealsSummaryCards, DealsTableView, DealsPipelineView, DealsFiltersAndSearch, CreateDealModal, DealsImportExport, DealsListContent) and section headers. Added new jobs for DealsImportExport and DealsListContent.\n\n2. **PlanComponentDealsSummaryCards**: Added 6 test entries covering the 4 summary cards (Total Active Deals, Pipeline Value, Won Q3, Lost Q3) plus filter responsiveness.\n\n3. **PlanComponentDealsTableView**: Added 22 test entries covering column headers, all 7 data columns, Close Date sort arrow indicator, row click navigation, action menu (View/Edit/Delete with confirmation), and pagination (display, next/prev, disabled states).\n\n4. **PlanComponentDealsPipelineView**: Added 8 test entries covering stage columns, deal cards display, drag-and-drop between columns with API update, same-column drop no-op, filter reflection, and card click navigation.\n\n5. **PlanComponentDealsFiltersAndSearch**: Added 17 test entries covering all 6 filter controls (Stage dropdown, Client searchable FilterSelect, Status dropdown, Date Range picker, Sort by dropdown, Search input), FilterSelect search behavior, \"No matches\" state, combined AND logic, and filter persi... (truncated)\n\n6. **PlanComponentCreateDealModal**: Added 16 test entries covering Create button display, modal open/close, all form fields (name, client searchable dropdown, value, stage, owner user dropdown, probability, close date, status), validation, successful creation with timeline entry, and cancel/backdro...
