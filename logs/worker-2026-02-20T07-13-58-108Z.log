Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":116,"startLine":1,"totalLines":116}}}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    10→\n    11→2/14/2026: Sidebar navigation contains only Clients, Deals, and Tasks links. Dashboard, Reports, and Settings links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    12→\n    13→2/14/2026: Filter dropdowns on the deals page use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system.\n    14→\n    15→2/16/2026: Deal detail page attachment upload modal now supports both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n    16→\n    17→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page now supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    18→\n    19→2/16/2026: Task links on client detail page and deal detail page now navigate to /tasks/:taskId (the task detail page) instead of the deal detail page or being non-clickable.\n    20→\n    21→2/16/2026: Added Supabase authentication system. New pages: Login (/login) with email/password and Google OAuth, Register (/register) with name/email/password and Google OAuth, AuthCallback (/auth/callback) for OAuth redirects. All app routes are protected by a RequireAuth guard that redirects unauthenticated users to /login. The sidebar displays the authenticated user's name, avatar, and a sign-out button. All 10 Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware. Timeline events and deal history now attribute actions to the authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    22→\n    23→2/17/2026: Authentication is now optional. Removed Login and Register pages. Removed RequireAuth route guard — all pages are accessible without authentication. SSO (Google OAuth) now opens in a popup window instead of navigating the current window. The sidebar user area moved to the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated.\n    24→\n    25→2/18/2026: CSV import dialog on the clients page now shows a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Includes a \"Download CSV template\" button that generates a sample CSV file. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    26→\n    27→2/18/2026: CSV import extended to support deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks in addition to clients. Deals page has Import button with CSV format (Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status) — client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with CSV format (Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee) — client lookup by name. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with CSV format (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) — creates individuals and optionally associates them with clients by name. Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n    28→\n    29→2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. The Settings page has two sections: (1) Import & Export — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV. (2) Webhooks — CRUD for webhook configurations that can send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint. Sidebar navigation now includes Clients, Deals, Tasks, and Settings.\n    30→\n    31→2/19/2026: Webhook modal now includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    32→\n    33→2/20/2026: FilterSelect dropdowns with many options now include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    34→\n    35→2/20/2026: Fixed testSpec directive violations: CDP-HDR-02 now includes name save persistence verification (edit name, save, confirm persisted after reload) per the directive requiring mutation persistence tests. CDP-QA-04 stage dropdown label corrected from 'Proposal' to 'Proposal Sent' to match the actual application UI labels used in AddDealModal and other components.\n    36→\n    37→2/18/2026: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) and User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId). Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. Added /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members. Sidebar now has \"Team\" nav item. Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal now show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    38→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3bee5287-9fd5-49bf-a63f-fbb3c4d610f7","uuid":"76fe99dd-0adb-4887-b964-aec079b4dad1","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nChanges to the app spec from bug reports and maintenance.\n\n## Revisions\n\n2/14/2026: Attachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.\n\n2/14/2026: Added a TaskDetailPage at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\n2/14/2026: Sidebar navigation contains only Clients, Deals, and Tasks links. Dashboard, Reports, and Settings links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n2/14/2026: Filter dropdowns on the deals page use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system.\n\n2/16/2026: Deal detail page attachment upload modal now supports both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page now supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n2/16/2026: Task links on client detail page and deal detail page now navigate to /tasks/:taskId (the task detail page) instead of the deal detail page or being non-clickable.\n\n2/16/2026: Added Supabase authentication system. New pages: Login (/login) with email/password and Google OAuth, Register (/register) with name/email/password and Google OAuth, AuthCallback (/auth/callback) for OAuth redirects. All app routes are protected by a RequireAuth guard that redirects unauthenticated users to /login. The sidebar displays the authenticated user's name, avatar, and a sign-out button. All 10 Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware. Timeline events and deal history now attribute actions to the authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n\n2/17/2026: Authentication is now optional. Removed Login and Register pages. Removed RequireAuth route guard — all pages are accessible without authentication. SSO (Google OAuth) now opens in a popup window instead of navigating the current window. The sidebar user area moved to the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated.\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import dialog on the clients page now shows a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Includes a \"Download CSV template\" button that generates a sample CSV file. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import extended to support deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks in addition to clients. Deals page has Import button with CSV format (Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status) — client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with CSV format (Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee) — client lookup by name. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with CSV format (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) — creates individuals and optionally associates them with clients by name. Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n\n2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link.

Let me systematically check each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecPersonDetailPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in PersonDetailPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. **Images consistency**: Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling. Prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images.\n2. **Inventory every visible element**: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n3. **Don't substitute easier elements**: Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\n\n\n4. **Exact navigation targets**: Every clickable element needs its exact navigation target or action result specified in the test entry.\n5. **Mutation persistence + side effects**: When user actions mutate data, I need to verify the change persists and that all the right side effects happen.\n6. **Button and control appearance**: Button styling, text, and icons matter—if the mockup shows specific details, the test entry must verify them.\n7. **Modal dialogs**: Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they work properly.\n8. **Attachment - file uploads**: File upload functionality should be supported unless the mockup explicitly shows otherwise.\n9. **Import/upload format**: Import and upload dialogs must specify what data format is expected.\n10. **Backend integrations setup instructions**: Any configurable backend integrations need complete setup instructions included.\n11. **State-changing actions cross-page**: State-changing actions should have tests verifying that other parts of the app update appropriately, like timeline or history entries.\n\nNow I'm checking the PersonDetailPage test entries against these directives. Looking at the PersonHeader section, the existing entries seem to cover the key scenarios—testing name and contact info display, verifying that clicking associated client links navigates correctly, and confirming that the edit button makes fields editable.\n\nFor the RelationshipsSection, I'm seeing tests for section display with view and filter toggles, list view entries, navigation links, the add entry form modal, mutation persistence when adding relationships, filter functionality, and graph view. The entries appear to be cut off at PDP-REL-07.\n\nNow moving into ContactHistorySection tests, which cover section display, entry details, the add entry modal, mutation persistence for new entries, edit form functionality, persistence of edits, filtering, and deletion with mutation persistence.\n\nI'm also starting to see AssociatedClientsSection entries beginning to appear.\n\nNow I'm checking the test coverage against the key directives: the header test covers all visible elements specified in the AppSpec, navigation targets are explicitly specified in the relevant tests, and I'm verifying that all data-mutating actions have corresponding persistence checks. The modals for adding and editing relationships and contact history all have open and save tests, but I'm noticing the test spec doesn't explicitly cover cancel button behavior on any of them—which seems like it might conflict with the directive to completely test modal functionality. Let me look at what the actual tests cover to see if this is a real gap.\n\nFor the state-changing actions directive, I'm checking whether edits to person info are verified to propagate across the app—like whether changing a name on the edit modal shows up on the detail page—but the test spec doesn't seem to explicitly verify this cross-page update behavior. Looking back at the AppSpec requirements for PersonDetailPage, the test entries actually do cover the key features well — relationships are tested, and the contact history logging is addressed too.\n\nI notice the AppSpec references a mockup I can't access, so I'll need to verify the implementation against the text description and component code instead of the visual reference.\n\nLooking through the PersonHeader component, I can see the key elements are covered: name, title, contact details, client associations with links, and the edit functionality with form fields and action buttons. The RelationshipsSection is next on my list to check.\n\nNow examining the RelationshipsSection—it has the view toggle between graph and list modes, filtering and add entry options, relationship items displaying name, type, role, and company with delete capabilities, and the graph's center node. Moving on to ContactHistorySection, I'm verifying the section heading, filter button, add entry button, and the entry items with their date, type, summary, and team member information.\n\nChecking AssociatedClientsSection next—the client cards show name, status, industry, and a view button. The testSpec entries for PersonDetailPage look fairly comprehensive so far. Let me verify once more against the core directives, particularly that every clickable element specifies its exact navigation target or action result, like the relationship link navigating to /individuals/<individualId> and the client card navigating to /clients/<clientId>.\n\nI'm noticing a gap though—the breadcrumb at the top of PersonDetailPage has a \"Clients\" link that navigates to /clients, but there's no test entry for it. The directives are clear that every clickable element needs a test entry with its navigation target, so this looks like a potential violation I need to address. I need to refocus on what I'm actually checking — the test entries themselves for directive violations, not whether the implementation matches the spec. Let me look at the testSpec.md directives systematically: consistent styling, inventorying every visible element, avoiding easier substitutes, exact navigation targets, testing persistence and side effects, button appearance, complete modal coverage, file uploads, import documentation, backend setup, and cross-page state changes. Now I'll review the PersonDetailPage test entries against these criteria. The test entries for PersonDetailPage list four components, but the actual code includes a breadcrumb that isn't documented in the test section—this could violate directive 2 if the breadcrumb appears in the mockup. I need to verify whether the breadcrumb should be inventoried as a visible element or if it's considered part of the page structure itself.\n\nFor the PDP-HDR-04 test about saving edited person info, the test correctly verifies persistence to the database. The directive requires checking for side effects like timeline entries, but the code shows that editing person info only updates the individuals endpoint without creating any timeline entries, so there are no additional side effects to test here.\n\nNow looking at the relationship and contact history tests: adding a relationship persists the change and shows in the list, with no side effects from the code. Deleting a relationship removes it from the list and persists the deletion. Similarly, adding a contact history entry appears in the log at the correct position and persists, while deleting an entry removes it from the log.\n\nI'm noticing an inconsistency in how persistence is documented across tests. PDP-HDR-04 says \"Change persisted to database\" but doesn't explicitly mention page reload confirmation like the other deletion tests do. Let me check how other similar tests handle this verification to ensure consistency.\n\nLooking at CDP-HDR-02, it also states \"Change is persisted to database\" without explicitly calling out a page reload, so this phrasing seems acceptable as long as the directive requirement to verify persistence is met. The wording is sufficient even if it doesn't spell out the reload step.\n\nNow I need to verify the modal dialog coverage is complete. For AddRelationshipModal, I see PDP-REL-04 covers opening and PDP-REL-05 covers saving. For AddContactHistoryModal, PDP-CH-03 tests opening and PDP-CH-04 should cover the save action.\n\nThe gap I'm noticing is that while these entries describe the modal opening and saving, they don't explicitly mention the modal closing after save or testing the Cancel button. PDP-REL-04 mentions the Save/Cancel buttons exist, but there's no dedicated test for actually clicking Cancel to close without saving. Similarly, PDP-REL-05 and PDP-CH-04 describe the results of saving but don't explicitly state the modal closes afterward.\n\nThere's also a discrepancy in PDP-REL-04 — it describes a \"create new\" option for the person field, but the actual implementation only has a searchable select without that creation capability. I need to figure out whether the test description is aspirational or if the implementation is incomplete. The spec doesn't actually specify how relationships get added — whether through search and select or by creating new ones. So there's a mismatch: the test entry PDP-REL-04 mentions \"create new\" as an option, but the AddRelationshipModal code only supports selecting existing persons. This means either the test is overstating what should happen, or the implementation is incomplete.\n\nLooking at how ClientDetailPage handles this — it lets you create new persons or associate existing ones — it makes sense that PersonDetailPage would only allow associating existing persons since you're linking relationships between people who already exist. So the test entry's mention of \"create new\" seems inaccurate for this context.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the button labels in the test entries match what's actually in the code, starting with the \"+\" button text in PDP-REL-01.\n\nThe button displays \"Add Entry\" with a Plus icon, which matches the test entry's \"+ Add Entry\" notation. Same pattern holds for PDP-CH-01 with the contact history section buttons.\n\nI'm also verifying the Associated Clients section — specifically the Industry field that shows in the cards. The code pulls the industry value from the client association data, which should work fine as long as that field exists on the ClientAssociation type. The test entry describes cards showing client details including industry information, but the description appears to be cut off.\n\nLooking at what the code actually renders for each client card: it uses a Building2 icon rather than a custom client logo, displays the client name, shows a status badge, includes the industry field if available, and has a \"View Client Detail Page\" button. The test spec mentions \"client icon/logo\" but using a generic Building2 icon is reasonable since individual clients probably don't have custom logos.\n\nI think I've covered the main points. There's one violation I've identified: PDP-REL-04 describes the person field as supporting both selection and creation of new persons, but the actual implementation only allows searching and selecting existing ones, so the test entry should be updated to reflect that limitation.\n\nActually, let me double-check the breadcrumb navigation. The PersonDetailPage has a breadcrumb trail at the top with \"Clients / Individuals / {name}\" where \"Clients\" is clickable, but I don't see a test entry for this interactive breadcrumb element. Given the directive to inventory every visible element and specify navigation targets for clickable items, this might be a gap if the breadcrumb appears in the mockup.\n\nThe question is whether the breadcrumb was part of the original spec or added as a helpful feature by the developer. Since it's a functional clickable element that affects navigation, it probably should have a test entry regardless. Let me also check if there are any cross-page state effects that aren't being tested.\n\nNow I'm looking at the PersonDetailPage and whether changes there propagate correctly — if someone edits a person's name or title, does that update in the ClientDetailPage's People section? And when relationships are added, are they bidirectional? The test entries don't seem to cover these cross-page effects, which could be violations of the directive requiring state-changing actions to have tests confirming other parts of the app update appropriately.\n\nI'm realizing I need to distinguish between what's actually required versus what would just be nice to have — not every cross-page effect necessarily needs its own test entry if it's not a core part of the feature contract.\n\nLooking at the testSpec directives, most are covered well: styling is consistent, navigation targets are exact, button appearances match, and there's no inappropriate substitution. The main areas where things could be stricter are around persistence and side effects, plus some minor gaps in modal cancel testing and cross-page state verification.\n\nBut focusing on clear violations: PDP-REL-04 is genuinely problematic because it claims the person field supports \"create new\" functionality, but the actual implementation only lets you search for existing people. That's a direct mismatch between what the test entry says and what the spec allows.\n\nRather than overthinking this, I should just identify what's actually worth fixing. The testSpec entries are pretty solid overall—no major directive violations jump out. For the writeApp and writeTests checks, I need to examine those directives against the PersonDetailPage components and the Playwright tests to see if there are real issues there. ) before deciding what fix groups to add.\n\n## Job 2: CheckComponentsPersonDetailPage — Check writeApp.md directive violations\n\nwriteApp.md directives:\n1. **Match test entries**: When working on a component, identify test entries and make sure they're satisfied.\n2. **Visual appearance**: Match visual appearance to mockup — button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts, field sets.\n3. **data-testid**: All components must include data-testid attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything E2E tests need. Add testids during initial development.\n4. **Monorepo base**: `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` in netlify.toml — not directly relevant to components.\n5. **Neon tagged template literals**: Use tagged template literal syntax only.\n6. **Empty strings to null for DB**: Convert empty strings to null.\n7. **Netlify function path indices**: Path index 2 for function name, 3 for resource ID.\n8. **Searchable select for entity references**: Use searchable select/dropdown, not plain text for IDs.\n9. **No duplicate nav links**: Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links.\n10. **No native HTML select**: Never use native `<select>` for filter controls.\n11. **File-type-specific attachment icons**: Not relevant for PersonDetailPage.\n12. **Actual file uploads for attachments**: Not relevant for PersonDetailPage.\n\nNow I'm checking each directive against the components. Starting with data-testid attributes — PersonHeader.tsx has the required testids on the header and edit form elements. Continuing through the test IDs for the relationships section and its filter options... Adding test IDs for the remaining relationship graph elements and moving on to the contact history section with its filter options... Adding test IDs for the associated clients section and the add relationship modal... Continuing through the test IDs for the edit contact history modal and its various input fields and action buttons.\n\nNow I'm checking the searchable select requirement for entity references. The AddRelationshipModal correctly uses a searchable person select, and the AddContactHistoryModal uses FilterSelect for the type field, but the team member field is just a plain text input rather than a searchable select from actual users—which seems like it might not align with the directive about referencing other entities. to a User entity. The AppRevisions say \"Deal owner and task assignee fields... now show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\" But this was only applied to deal owner and task assignee fields, not to the contact history team member field.\n\nIs the team member field supposed to be a reference to a User entity? Looking at PDP-CH-02: \"Team Member: Michael B. (Sales Lead)\". This looks like a team member name, which could be free text or could reference a user. The AppRevisions added a Users API and changed deal owner and task assignee to use user dropdowns, but didn't explicitly mention the contact history team member field.\n\nI think this IS a violation of the writeApp directive. The contact history team member field references a team member, which is an entity (a User). It should use a searchable user select dropdown, consistent with how deal owner and task assignee work.\n\nThough re-reading the directive more carefully: \"When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\" The team member field accepts a name string rather than an ID, so it might not technically violate the directive. But semantically, since the team member IS a user in the system and the AppRevisions already changed similar fields to use user dropdowns, the contact history team member should probably follow the same pattern for consistency.\n\nNow checking Directive 10 about native HTML selects — I'm reviewing all the dropdown components across the PersonDetailPage to make sure they're using custom dropdowns rather than native select elements. RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, and both modals all use FilterSelect or custom dropdowns, so that's good.\n\nMoving on to verify the test entries against the actual implementation, starting with the header display requirements. The contact history tests are all passing, along with the associated clients section. Now I need to verify the backend function is using the proper neon tagged template literals for the database queries.\n\nLooking at the component structure, each section has consistent styling with internal padding and bottom margins for spacing between sections—PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, and AssociatedClientsSection all follow the same pattern. The `mb-4` spacing is for separating sections, not outer layout concerns, so they're properly isolated. I need to focus on just the Directives section from writeApp.md, not the Tips. Going through the actual directives in lines 49-96, I can see most of them are already satisfied, but I still need to verify the backend-specific ones around Neon tagged templates, empty string conversions, and Netlify function paths.\n\nSince the job specifically mentions \"PersonDetailPage components,\" that's the frontend layer, so the backend directives would likely be checked separately. Looking at what I can verify in the frontend components themselves, I'm not finding any clear violations — the data-testid attributes are in place, custom dropdowns are being used instead of native selects, and entity references are using searchable selects as required.\n\nNow I'm moving on to Job 3 to check the test file against the writeTests guidelines. md directive violations\n\nwriteTests.md directives:\n1. **Verify navigation targets precisely**: Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click. ✓ or ✗?\n2. **Side effects assertions**: For actions with side effects, verify both primary and side effects. Assert side effect happens exactly once.\n3. **Avoid getByText with common words**: Prefer getByTestId. Never work around ambiguity with .first().\n4. **Consistent data-testid values**: All test files for same component must use same testid values.\n5. **File upload mechanics**: Tests must exercise actual file upload mechanics for file upload specs.\n6. **No locator calls inside .toPass()**: Never put auto-wait calls inside .toPass() retry blocks.\n7. **Strategy file paths**: At /repo/strategies/jobs/...\n8. **Auth e2e test**: Apps with login must have complete e2e test. N/A for PersonDetailPage tests specifically.\n\nPlus parallel test design requirements: no fixed counts, create records in beforeAll, no hardcoded IDs, fullyParallel: true.\n\nNow I'm checking the test file against these directives. The navigation tests are asserting URLs correctly with regex patterns after clicks, which satisfies the first directive.\n\nFor the second directive on side effects, I'm looking at the relationship tests. The spec mentions PDP-REL-05 should verify that adding a relationship persists and shows in the list, but scanning the actual test file, I see tests labeled PDP-HDR-01 through PDP-HDR-04, then PDP-REL-01 through PDP-REL-06. There's a mismatch between what the spec describes and what's actually implemented in the test file.\n\nNow I'm comparing the test titles more carefully against the spec entries to see where they align and where they diverge.\n\nI found a mismatch: the test labeled PDP-HDR-04 is testing the cancel functionality that restores original values, but the spec's PDP-HDR-04 actually covers saving edited person info and persisting those changes. This means the spec's save persistence requirement doesn't have a corresponding test, and the test for cancel behavior doesn't match any spec entry—that's a violation of the requirement that test titles must match their spec counterparts.\n\nLet me continue checking the remaining tests to see how widespread this issue is.\n\nLooking at PDP-REL-05, the test checks whether the save button is disabled when the person ID is empty, but the spec expects the test to verify that adding a relationship actually persists and appears in the list. PDP-REL-06 only validates that the filter dropdown opens, not that it actually filters relationships by type as the spec requires. I'm also noticing that PDP-REL-08 for deleting relationships is completely missing from the test file, and PDP-CH-04 is testing disabled save state rather than persistence of new entries.\n\nSimilarly, PDP-CH-06 tests whether the cancel button closes the modal instead of verifying that edits persist, and PDP-CH-08 for deleting entries is absent entirely. So I'm seeing a pattern of gaps: several critical persistence and deletion tests are missing, and some existing tests are checking UI behavior rather than actual data operations. I'm also noticing that the missing persistence and mutation tests violate the second directive about verifying side effects alongside primary effects. Now looking at the third directive about avoiding common words in getByText — most of the selectors are reasonably specific within their modal scope, though \"Type *\" is borderline since it's a common word, but the exact match requirement probably makes it acceptable.\n\nHowever, I'm realizing getByText does substring matching by default, which means \"Type *\" could potentially match \"Relationship Type *\" if both are visible in the same modal. Let me verify which modals actually contain these labels — the contact history modal has \"Type *\" while the relationship modal has \"Relationship Type *\", so they're in different modals and shouldn't cause conflicts.\n\nWithin the AddContactHistoryModal specifically, \"Type *\" should be unique since \"Date/Time *\" doesn't contain \"Type *\" as a substring. The testing directive prefers getByTestId for precision, but getByText with \"Type *\" works here since it's unambiguous within that modal scope. That said, using getByTestId would be more aligned with best practices.\n\nNow checking the Summary/Notes field — modal.getByText('Summary/Notes *') is also unique within the modal. Looking at the test file's data-testid values, they're all consistent with what the components define: person-header, person-header-name, person-header-edit-button, relationships-section, relationships-view-toggle, contact-history-section, and associated-clients-section all check out. I don't see any .toPass() blocks that would violate the directive about locator calls, and the test doesn't appear to be structured for parallel execution.\n\nThe tests are using dynamic count checks rather than fixed numbers, discovering IDs from the UI instead of hardcoding them, and not relying on pristine data. For navigation verification, PDP-REL-03 checks that we land on an individuals page using a regex pattern, but it's not verifying the specific individual we navigated to — it could match any individual page. A more precise assertion would extract the expected ID first and verify the full URL. That's a minor weakness though, not a critical failure.\n\nThe main issue I'm finding is that several test titles don't align with the spec entries.\n\nMore importantly, there are significant gaps in test coverage. Multiple spec entries have no corresponding Playwright tests at all — the persistence and mutation tests are completely missing. The existing tests only verify that UI elements are visible and modals open or close, but they don't actually test whether data operations like saving, adding, or deleting are persisting correctly. That's a major gap I need to address with new test groups.\n\nLooking at the violations across all three jobs, the writeTests violations are the most critical. The PersonDetailPage tests have mismatched titles and missing test cases, all stemming from the same root issue: the tests were written to check UI visibility rather than to match the actual spec requirements. I'll consolidate these into a single fix group since they're all part of the same component and share the same underlying
