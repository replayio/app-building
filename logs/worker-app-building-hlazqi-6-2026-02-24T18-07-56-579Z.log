There is NO test file for TaskDetailPage.\n\n**writeTests.md directive violations:**\n\n1. **\"Write playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied\"** - VIOLATED: No test file exists for TaskDetailPage\n2. **\"The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry\"** - Cannot evaluate: no tests or test entries exist\n3. **\"Tests must verify navigation targets precisely\"** - VIOLATED: No tests exist\n4. **\"For actions that produce side effects, write assertions\"** - VIOLATED: No tests exist\n5. **\"Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements\"** - Cannot evaluate: no tests exist\n\n---\n\n## Summary of All Violations\n\nAll three jobs point to the same root cause: **The TaskDetailPage has not been built out at all.** It exists only as:\n- An empty heading in `docs/tests.md`\n- A stub component with just a heading\n- No test file\n\nThe AppRevisions.md specifies the page should have task info display, notes section, and task actions. The backend already has the `tasks.ts` function supporting single task fetch by ID, and the schema has a `task_notes` table, but no task-notes backend function exists.\n\nNow I'll add fix groups. Since this requires building the page from scratch following the standard pipeline (test spec → components → tests), I'll add groups using the appropriate build strategies.\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPageTaskDetail: Decide on TaskDetailPage components, add sections and test entries to docs/tests.md for TaskDetailPage\"\nAdded group at front: 1 job(s) (strategy: strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md)\n  - PlanPageTaskDetail: Decide on TaskDetailPage components, add sections and test entries to docs/tests.md for TaskDetailPage\nQueue now has 71 group(s).\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanTaskDetailComponents: Plan and write TaskDetailPage components (sections, backend functions for task notes) based on docs/tests.md\" --trailing\nAdded group at end: 1 job(s) (strategy: strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md)\n  - PlanTaskDetailComponents: Plan and write TaskDetailPage components (sections, backend functions for task notes) based on docs/tests.md\nQueue now has 72 group(s).\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanTaskDetailTests: Write playwright tests for TaskDetailPage based on docs/tests.md entries\" --trailing\nAdded group at end: 1 job(s) (strategy: strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md)\n  - PlanTaskDetailTests: Write playwright tests for TaskDetailPage based on docs/tests.md entries\nQueue now has 73 group(s).\n[TodoWrite]\nAll three jobs are complete. Here's a summary of findings and actions:\n\n**Violations found (all three jobs share the same root cause):**\n- **TaskDetailPage test entries**: Section in `docs/tests.md` is completely empty - no components listed, no test entries\n- **TaskDetailPage components**: Page is a stub (just a heading) - no functionality implemented.

Let me also verify that I'm using consistent `data-testid` values and not having any issues with the modal overlay test ID (both CreateContactModal and ImportDialog use `modal-overlay`).\n\nLooking at the test, the overlay click test for CreateContactModal at line 400 uses `page.getByTestId('modal-overlay')` which could match both the CreateContactModal overlay and ImportDialog overlay. But since CreateContactModal is the only modal open at that point, it should work fine.\n\nLet me also verify that the `contacts-table-row` doesn't have a unique ID per row - looking at the ContactsTable component, each row uses `data-testid=\"contacts-table-row\"` (same for all rows), which is fine for our tests since we use `.first()`, `.filter()`, or `.nth()` methods.\n[TodoWrite]\nAll 31 tests have been written in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/contacts-list.spec.ts`. The tests cover:\n\n- **ContactsSearchBar** (6 tests): Search filtering by name, email, title, phone, location, and clearing search\n- **ContactsTable** (7 tests): Column headers, displaying name/title/email/phone/location/clients, and row navigation\n- **CreateContactModal** (6 tests): Opening modal, form validation, creating contact, searchable client dropdown, cancel, overlay close\n- **ContactsListContent** (8 tests): Page heading, loading state, empty states (no match/no contacts), pagination controls/next/previous\n- **CSV Export/Import** (4 tests): CSV export download, import dialog, valid file import, validation errors\n\nAll tests use consistent `data-testid` values matching the existing components, follow the strategy guidelines (generous timeouts, no `.toPass()` with nested waits, proper `setInputFiles` for file upload), and the code passes type check and lint.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 192934ms | Turns: 40 | Cost: $1.2725\nCost: $1.2725 (total: $44.1307)\nTurns: 40\nGroup signaled <DONE>.

The search mechanism (debounced, searches across name/email/title/phone/location)\n3. The table structure (6 columns)\n4. The CreateContactModal with form fields and validation\n5. The ImportDialog with CSV upload\n6. The pagination system (50 per page)\n7. The existing test patterns from `tasks-list.spec.ts`\n[TodoWrite]\nNow let me check the router configuration to confirm the contacts route is set up correctly.\n[grep] contacts|individuals|PersonDetail\nGood. Now I have all the info. Let me write the test file.\n[write] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/contacts-list.spec.ts\nNow let me run the type check to make sure the test file has no issues.\n[TodoWrite]\n$ cd /repo/apps/SalesCRM && npm run check 2>&1 | tail -50\n> sales-crm@0.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\nRunning typecheck...\nRunning lint...\nAll checks passed.\nThe code passes type check and lint. Let me now verify the test count matches all 31 required tests by counting the test cases in my file.\n[grep] ^\\s+test\\('\nHmm, let me check differently.\n[grep] test\\(\nAll 31 tests are present, one for each required job. Let me verify each test title matches the job description exactly.\n\nLet me cross-reference the test titles with the jobs:\n\n1. \"Search input filters contacts by name\" - Job 1 ✓\n2. \"Search input filters contacts by email\" - Job 2 ✓\n3. \"Search input filters contacts by title\" - Job 3 ✓\n4. \"Search input filters contacts by phone\" - Job 4 ✓\n5. \"Search input filters contacts by location\" - Job 5 ✓\n6. \"Search input clears and shows all contacts\" - Job 6 ✓\n7. \"Table displays correct column headers\" - Job 7 ✓\n8. \"Table rows display contact name\" - Job 8 ✓\n9. \"Table rows display contact title\" - Job 9 ✓\n10. \"Table rows display contact email\" - Job 10 ✓\n11. \"Table rows display contact phone\" - Job 11 ✓\n12. \"Table rows display contact location\" - Job 12 ✓\n13. \"Table rows display associated clients\" - Job 13 ✓\n14. \"Clicking a contact row navigates to PersonDetailPage\" - Job 14 ✓\n15. \"Clicking Add Contact button opens CreateContactModal\" - Job 15 ✓\n16. \"CreateContactModal form validates required fields\" - Job 16 ✓\n17. \"CreateContactModal successfully creates a contact\" - Job 17 ✓\n18. \"CreateContactModal client dropdown is searchable FilterSelect\" - Job 18 ✓\n19. \"CreateContactModal cancel button closes modal without creating\" - Job 19 ✓\n20. \"CreateContactModal closes on overlay click\" - Job 20 ✓\n21. \"Page displays heading and Add Contact button\" - Job 21 ✓\n22. \"Loading state shows while contacts are being fetched\" - Job 22 ✓\n23. \"Empty state shown when no contacts match search\" - Job 23 ✓\n24. \"Empty state shown when no contacts exist\" - Job 24 ✓\n25. \"Pagination controls appear when contacts exceed page size\" - Job 25 ✓\n26. \"Clicking next page loads the next set of contacts\" - Job 26 ✓\n27. \"Clicking previous page loads the previous set of contacts\" - Job 27 ✓\n28. \"CSV export downloads contacts as CSV file\" - Job 28 ✓\n29. \"CSV import button opens import dialog\" - Job 29 ✓\n30. \"CSV import processes valid file and creates contacts\" - Job 30 ✓\n31. \"CSV import shows validation errors for invalid data\" - Job 31 ✓\n\nAll 31 tests match. Let me also verify that I'm using consistent `data-testid` values and not having any issues with the modal overlay test ID (both CreateContactModal and ImportDialog use `modal-overlay`).\n\nLooking at the test, the overlay click test for CreateContactModal at line 400 uses `page.getByTestId('modal-overlay')` which could match both the CreateContactModal overlay and ImportDialog overlay. But since CreateContactModal is the only modal open at that point, it should work fine.\n\nLet me also verify that the `contacts-table-row` doesn't have a unique ID per row - looking at the ContactsTable component, each row uses `data-testid=\"contacts-table-row\"` (same for all rows), which is fine for our tests since we use `.first()`, `.filter()`, or `.nth()` methods.\n[TodoWrite]\nAll 31 tests have been written in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/contacts-list.spec.ts`. The tests cover:\n\n- **ContactsSearchBar** (6 tests): Search filtering by name, email, title, phone, location, and clearing search\n- **ContactsTable** (7 tests): Column headers, displaying name/title/email/phone/location/clients, and row navigation\n- **CreateContactModal** (6 tests): Opening modal, form validation, creating contact, searchable client dropdown, cancel, overlay close\n- **ContactsListContent** (8 tests): Page heading, loading state, empty states (no match/no contacts), pagination controls/next/previous\n- **CSV Export/Import** (4 tests): CSV export download, import dialog, valid file import, validation errors\n\nAll tests use consistent `data-testid` values matching the existing components, follow the strategy guidelines (generous timeouts, no `.toPass()` with nested waits, proper `setInputFiles` for file upload), and the code passes type check and lint.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 192934ms | Turns: 40 | Cost: $1.2725\nCost: $1.2725 (total: $44.1307)\nTurns: 40\nGroup signaled <DONE>.
