There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"06cc4bfe-b987-441b-99bc-d60e98adecca","uuid":"f528b3b5-79db-4583-9c93-fd21342724a2","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

Looking at all the components, they actually already exist and are well-implemented. Let me review what the subtasks are asking me to do:\n\n1. WriteComponentSupplierOverview: Write the SupplierOverview component\n2. WriteComponentDocumentsTab: Write the DocumentsTab component\n3. WriteComponentCommentsSection: Write the CommentsSection component\n4. WriteComponentOrdersSection: Write the OrdersSection component\n5. WritePageSupplierDetails: Write the SupplierDetailsPage itself\n\nLooking at the existing code, these components already exist and appear quite complete. But the task says to \"write\" them, so perhaps these files need improvements or there are issues. Let me compare the components against the test spec to see if they fully satisfy requirements.\n\n\nNow I'm checking each component against the test requirements. The SupplierOverview component appears to handle all the key features—displaying supplier details like name and address, showing contact information, rendering a status badge, and providing navigation and edit/delete functionality.\n\nFor the DocumentsTab, I'm verifying it displays document cards with all necessary details, supports searching by filename, and includes action buttons for viewing and downloading documents. The CommentsSection needs to show comment counts and timestamps, allow adding new comments, and support collapsing/expanding the section.\n\nNow I'm noticing an issue with the comment addition flow—when a new comment is added, the component needs to refetch the comments list so the count updates and the new comment appears at the top. Looking at how the SupplierDetailsPage handles this, the `onAddComment` callback dispatches an action but I need to verify it's actually triggering a refetch of the comments rather than just sending the request. I'm realizing these components were already written in a previous commit, but my current task queue is asking me to write them again—let me check the git history and AppRevisions to understand what's actually needed here.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the component implementations against the test specifications to spot any issues: the SupplierOverview's \"Back to Dashboard\" button placement looks correct, but CommentsSection might not be refetching the comment count after adding a new comment, and OrdersSection appears to have the right columns for the Historical Orders table.\n\nSince this task is being retried, something must have failed before—let me check if `addSupplierComment` properly updates the list in the Redux slice, or if there's a missing refetch that's causing the test to fail.","signature":"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

Let me examine this situation more carefully:\n\nThe components all already exist and appear to be properly implemented. Let me check for any issues:\n\n1. **SupplierOverview** - Looks good. Matches the spec.\n\n2. **DocumentsTab** - Looks good. Has search, upload with file picker and type selection, view/download actions.\n\n3. **SupplierCommentsSection** - Looks good. Has collapse/expand, add comment, display comments. The `addSupplierComment.fulfilled` handler in the slice does `state.comments.unshift(action.payload)` which adds it to the front.\n\n\n4. **OrdersSection** - Looks good. Has tab switching, search, filter by status, correct columns for each tab.\n\n5. **SupplierDetailsPage** - Looks good. Fetches data, shows breadcrumb, shows all sections.\n\nNow I'm checking the `onAddComment` callback to see if the backend response includes the necessary fields like `created_at` and `author_name` when a comment is added via the thunk.\n\nThe POST request sends the comment text and author name, then the fulfilled handler adds the server response directly to the comments array. Since these tasks might have been retried before and the code already exists, I should run a quality check to verify everything passes type checking and linting.\n\nLooking at the git history, I can see these components were already committed in an earlier change, so I need to confirm the implementation is correct and signal completion once the checks pass. Looking at the test specifications for SupplierDetailsPage, I'm verifying that the existing code matches each requirement. The breadcrumb navigation, tab links, and SupplierOverview section all appear to be correctly implemented with the right structure and styling. I'm now checking the address field and other details to ensure they match the expected multi-line format and complete data display. The comments section looks solid with the Redux dispatch handling new comments correctly. The orders section also checks out with tabs, search, and status filtering all working as expected. I should run the quality gate to verify everything compiles, though it should already be passing since this was committed before. Let me also verify that the `text-right` CSS class is properly defined for the table alignment. Looking at the git history, I can see that the SupplierOverview commit from earlier already includes multiple subtasks, so this task was likely completed before but the agent didn't properly signal completion. The task is still queued because the worker probably ran out of context after committing.\n\nSince the code already exists and matches what was requested, I should verify it compiles correctly, mark
