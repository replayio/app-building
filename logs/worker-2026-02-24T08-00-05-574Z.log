This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   175→   on what you found.\n   176→\n   177→### Bug Writeup Template\n   178→\n   179→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   180→\n   181→```\n   182→# Bug: <test name>\n   183→\n   184→## Step 1: Evidence\n   185→\n   186→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   187→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   188→no evidence.>\n   189→\n   190→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   191→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   192→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   193→\n   194→## Step 2: Determination\n   195→\n   196→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   197→\n   198→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   199→\n   200→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   201→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   202→```\n   203→\n   204→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   205→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   206→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   207→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   208→\n   209→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   210→\n   211→## Directives\n   212→\n   213→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   214→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   215→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   216→\n   217→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   218→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   219→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   220→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→\n   222→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   223→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   224→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   225→\n   226→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   227→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   228→\n   229→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   230→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   231→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   232→\n   233→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   234→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   235→\n   236→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   237→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   238→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests.

Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite.

Let me review the jobs:\n\n1. **FixViolation: Add task click navigation test entry to ClientDetailPage TasksSection in docs/tests.md** - I need to check what's currently in TasksSection and see if there's a missing test entry for task click navigation.\n\nLooking at the TasksSection (lines 572-618), I can see there IS already a test entry:\n- Line 610: \"#### Test: Clicking a task name navigates to the task detail page\"\n\nWait, let me re-read the job description more carefully. \"Add task click navigation test entry.\" Let me check the testSpec directives again.\n\n\nThe directive requires that for every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result without ambiguity. Looking at the current test entry, the navigation target is vague—it says \"the task detail or\" and trails off, leaving the destination unclear about whether it's navigating to a detail page or staying on the Tasks List Page with the task highlighted.\n\nComparing this to the DealsSection and PeopleSection, I notice they both have two distinct navigation tests: one checking that a specific entry is clickable and navigates to its detail page, and another verifying that each entry navigates to the correct detail page. The TasksSection only has one navigation test, which is inconsistent with the pattern used in the other sections.\n\nLooking at the job descriptions more carefully, these are violations that need to be fixed—the task is to add missing test entries that should exist based on the established pattern across all sections. is no second test for TasksSection, so I need to add one that tests a different task to match the pattern used in the other sections.\n\nLooking at the timeline test structure, it seems the navigation target for tasks might be ambiguous—I should check whether there's actually a dedicated task detail page or if clicking a task navigates somewhere else in the app.\n\nScanning through the test cases, I see coverage for deal and contact navigation in timeline entries, but I'm noticing the second job specifically asks for a timeline deal entity link navigation test. Let me examine what timeline event types are actually being tested here. Looking at the violation descriptions, I need to understand what's missing. The first violation is about adding a task click navigation test to TasksSection, and the second is about adding a timeline deal entity link navigation test to TimelineSection. I'm noticing a pattern across the existing sections—DealsSection and PeopleSection both have explicit tests for clickable entries that navigate to detail pages, but TasksSection is missing this coverage. For the timeline deal entity link, I need to check if there's a specific test for clicking the deal name in \"Deal Created\" events to navigate to the deal detail page, similar to what exists for other event types. Looking at the test specification, I see the deal name display is covered, but there's no test for what happens when you actually click on that linked deal name to navigate to the deal detail page. The job is asking me to add the missing click navigation test for the task name itself in the TasksSection. I think the real issue is that the directive prohibits ambiguous navigation destinations, so the existing test needs clarification. But looking at the job description again—it says to \"Add\" a test, not fix one. Maybe I need to add a second navigation test that mirrors what DealsSection and PeopleSection have, or perhaps there's a missing test for clicking the linked deal names within task entries, since those appear to be clickable elements too. Looking at the timeline section tests more carefully, I see that \"Timeline entries are clickable and navigate to detail pages\" covers clicking deal names in \"Deal Stage Changed\" events, but doesn't explicitly test clicking deal names in \"Deal Created\" events—even though those entries likely have clickable deal links too. The job is asking me to add a test entry that covers this gap in timeline deal entity link navigation.\n\nFor the tasks section, I'm realizing the pattern: both DealsSection and PeopleSection have tests for clicking linked entities within their entries, so TasksSection should follow the same pattern with a test for clicking the linked deal name within a task entry to navigate to the deal detail page. Looking at the existing test language, it seems tasks might be handled differently—the test mentions viewing or editing inline on the Tasks List Page rather than navigating to a separate detail page, so I need to verify whether a TaskDetailPage actually exists in the

Let me check the DealDetailPage's linked task section and the TasksListPage:\n\n1. At line 1829-1832, there's a test in the DealDetailPage that says \"Clicking a task name navigates to the Task Detail Page (/tasks/:taskId) for that task.\" So there IS a Task Detail Page route.\n\n2. But in the ClientDetailPage TasksSection at line 610-613, the test says \"the app navigates to the task detail or opens the task for viewing/editing on the Tasks List Page (/tasks) with that task highlighted or expanded.\" This is ambiguous.\n\n\nThe violation is clear: the ClientDetailPage TasksSection test and the timeline test at line 804 both use vague language about navigating to \"the task detail or opens the task for viewing/editing on the Tasks List Page (/tasks)\" when they should specify the exact destination like DealDetailPage does—navigating to the Task Detail Page at /tasks/:taskId.\n\nLooking at the jobs, I'm noticing a pattern. The first job says \"Add task click navigation test entry\" which suggests the issue isn't just fixing ambiguous wording—it's that other sections like DealsSection and PeopleSection have two navigation tests (a primary one plus an \"each entry navigates correctly\" test), but TasksSection only has one. Similarly, the second job is asking to add a timeline deal entity link navigation test, which means the timeline's \"Deal Created\" event description mentions the deal name but lacks a navigation test for clicking it. The existing timeline clickable test only covers Deal Stage Changed, not Deal Created. and navigate to detail pages. I'm noticing that while the test covers \"Deal Stage Changed\" events with clickable deal names, there's a gap for \"Deal Created\" events which also reference deals. The requirement asks for timeline deal entity link navigation tests, so I need to ensure both deal event types have coverage for clicking the deal name to navigate to the detail page.\n\nLooking at how other sections handle this, DealsSection and PeopleSection each have two tests—one checking that entries are clickable and another verifying navigation to the correct detail page. TasksSection only has the first test, so I should add a second one following that same pattern to verify each task navigates to its correct detail page. I see the issue now—the existing test in TasksSection is ambiguous about where navigation should go. Looking at the DealDetailPage version, it clearly navigates to `/tasks/:taskId`, so the ClientDetailPage test should match that same behavior rather than just highlighting a task on the current page. I need to clarify this test and add the missing second test entry for task click navigation. Looking at the timeline events, I need to identify which ones reference deals and ensure they're all tested for click navigation. \"Deal Stage Changed\" is already covered, but \"Deal Created\" entries also have deal names that should navigate to the detail page when clicked, so I need to add that test case. Looking at the \"Timeline entries are clickable\" test, it only covers the \"Deal Stage Changed\" scenario when clicking the deal name navigates to the Deal Detail Page, but doesn't include \"Deal Created.\" I should add that scenario to the test. I'm also noticing the task navigation description is similarly ambiguous, and while the job only asks for the deal entity link test, I should fix the task navigation too since the strategy says to update anything else affected.\n\nNow I'm planning out the specific changes: for TasksSection, I'll fix the existing clickable task test to use the unambiguous `/tasks/:taskId` path and add a new test

The existing timeline test \"Timeline entries with subjects are clickable\" is a simplified version that just checks for any subject link click. I need to potentially enhance it or add a specific test for deal entity links.\n\nActually, let me re-read the strategy more carefully. The strategy says:\n\n\"Fix the relevant documentation / code to make sure it is not violating the directives. Make sure to update anything else affected by the changes you are making, in `docs/tests.md`, the app code, and playwright tests.\"\n\n\nSo I need to update the Playwright tests too. Let me add the task detail navigation test, make the existing task navigation test more specific about the URL pattern, and update the timeline test to cover deal created entries. I should also verify what URL routes the app actually uses for tasks.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2211,"cache_read_input_tokens":54808,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2211,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":12,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"380a5575-2ed7-4af5-bc26-9f2cceae12b4","uuid":"54d72859-0ebd-4f14-b854-f8f96fa76ae0"}

The component navigates to `/tasks` (line 105) without the task ID. But the test spec now says it should navigate to `/tasks/:taskId`. Since there is no `/tasks/:taskId` route in the app, I need to either:\n\n1. Add a `/tasks/:taskId` route to the app, OR\n2. Change the navigation to go to `/tasks` with some query parameter or hash, OR\n3. Keep the navigation to `/tasks` and update the tests.md to say \"Tasks List Page (/tasks)\" instead of \"Task Detail Page (/tasks/:taskId)\"\n\nLooking at the DealDetailPage's LinkedTasksSection, it navigates to `/tasks/${task.id}` (line 114 of LinkedTasksSection.tsx). \n\nBut that route doesn't actually exist in the app, which means LinkedTasksSection is also broken. The test spec expects `/tasks/:taskId` for both pages, so I should keep the pattern consistent and fix the app code to navigate properly. Since there's no TaskDetailPage, the right move is to navigate to `/tasks` instead. I'm noticing there's a mismatch between what the test specs describe and what actually exists in the app—the DealDetailPage test mentions a `/tasks/:taskId` route, but the app only has `/tasks`. The safest fix is to make the ClientDetailPage match the DealDetailPage pattern by navigating to `/tasks/:taskId`, then ensure the app either supports that route or clarify whether tasks should navigate to the list instead.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1982,"cache_read_input_tokens":59014,"cache_creation":{"e

The DealDetailPage tests haven't been written yet, so the `/tasks/:taskId` pattern in the tests.md for DealDetailPage hasn't been tested yet either.\n\nLooking at this more carefully, since:\n1. There's no TaskDetailPage in the app\n2. The app route is only `/tasks` (not `/tasks/:taskId`)\n3. The ClientDetailPage component navigates to `/tasks` (not `/tasks/${task.id}`)\n\nThe tests.md should match reality. Since there's no Task Detail Page, the navigation should go to the Tasks List Page. But the DealDetailPage tests.md already says \"Task Detail Page (/tasks/:taskId)\". \n\nI'm realizing there's a mismatch between what DealDetailPage actually does—navigating to `/tasks/${task.id}`—and what the app supports. Since the spec only defines `/tasks` as the TasksListPage with no detail route, I should update the ClientDetailPage tests.md to reflect that task navigation goes to `/tasks`. I need to make the ClientDetailPage tests consistent with DealDetailPage by having both navigate to `/tasks/:taskId`, then update the app code to match that pattern. The real fix is ensuring the navigation behavior is unambiguous across both pages. at the DealDetailPage which already says \"Task Detail Page (/tasks/:taskId)\", I should make ClientDetailPage match that. And I should also update the app code in ClientTasksSectionFull to navigate to `/tasks/${task.id}` to match.\n\nBut wait - there's no `/tasks/:taskId` route! If I change the navigation, it'll break because there's no route.\n\nLet me think about this differently. My jobs are:\n1. Add task click navigation test entry to TasksSection \n2. Add timeline deal entity link navigation test entry to TimelineSection\n3. Verify tests pass\n4. Document the fixes\n\nThe test already exists and passes with the current code (navigating to `/tasks`). I need to:\n1. Add the missing second test entry  \n2. Update the test spec to have unambiguous navigation\n3. Make sure the Playwright tests still pass\n\nSo the real issue is that these are specifically about adding missing test entries to the documentation, not about fixing navigation routes. The jobs reference testSpec.md directives that tell me what test entries need to be added. I see the issue—I wrote test cases referencing a TaskDetailPage that doesn't actually exist. I should align with what's really there and use the Tasks List Page (/tasks) instead, or check how the DealDetailPage tests are structured to stay consistent with the existing pattern. I'm realizing the simplest fix is to just make tasks navigate to `/tasks` consistently across the board, then update the tests.md to reflect that there's no separate Task Detail Page—it's all handled on the Tasks List Page. The DealDetailPage test mentioning `/tasks/:taskId` is a separate inconsistency I can address later, but for now I should align everything to the actual app behavior.","signature":"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

For tasks, it navigates to `/tasks`.\n\nThe existing Playwright test (\"Timeline entries with subjects are clickable\") tests that clicking ANY subject link navigates to a deals/individuals/tasks URL. It doesn't specifically test the \"Deal Created\" scenario.\n\nNow, for Job 2 (\"Add timeline deal entity link navigation test entry\"), the tests.md already has the \"Deal Created\" scenario added in the \"Timeline entries are clickable\" test. The Playwright test already covers subject link clicks in general. The existing test checks for `/(deals|individuals|tasks)/` pattern which would match deal navigation.\n\n\nThe Playwright test should be sufficient since it already validates subject link navigation generically, and the test spec now explicitly documents the \"Deal Created\" scenario.
