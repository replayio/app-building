See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me scan through the full tests.md to see what's already documented and what the current structure looks like.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":196,"cache_read_input_tokens":30385,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":196,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e4d023f6-10fb-48f2-a2ad-a08872b2d09c","uuid":"39b810f5-124e-4f29-91f2-e9aab76f1d05"}

[2026-02-25T06:56:36.753Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_013zNnXd14NgmjhNGrDgsaYH","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a good understanding of the existing tests.md. The file currently has tests for:\n1. AccountsPage\n2. AccountDetailPage\n3. NewTransactionModal\n4. CreateReportDialog\n5. ReportDetails\n6. ReportList\n\nI need to add a new \"TransactionsPage\" section. This is a page that lists all transactions across all accounts with filters for date range, account, material, transaction type, and a search bar, plus a sortable transactions table with pagination and a new transaction button.\n\nLooking at the subtask descriptions:\n1. **PlanPageTransactions**: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\n\n\n2. **PlanComponentTransactionsFilters**: Add test entries for DateRangeFilter, AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, TransactionTypeFilter, SearchBar\n3. **PlanComponentTransactionsTableAndPagination**: Add test entries for TransactionsTable (sortable columns, row click navigation), Pagination, NewTransactionButton\n\nSince this is an accounting app, a dedicated Transactions page makes sense - it would show ALL transactions across all accounts, with various filter capabilities. But I'm noticing the AppSpec doesn't actually list a dedicated Transactions page, so I should verify this is the right approach before proceeding with the test documentation.\n\nThe Transactions page would need filters for date range, account, material/category, and transaction type, plus a search bar to help users find specific transactions. The main table should be sortable and support pagination, with a button to create new transactions. I should also check if the NavBar needs a Transactions link to match the existing navigation pattern of Dashboard, Accounts, Reports, and Budgets. I need to add the Transactions page to the navigation structure. Looking at the existing NavBar pattern with Dashboard, Accounts, Reports, and Budgets, I should include a Transactions link there too. Since the skill allows for necessary features beyond the spec to make the app functional, adding this navigation makes sense—I'll proceed with building out the page section and let the component tests handle the routing details.\n\nFor the Transactions page, I'm planning a header component for the title and breadcrumb, then several filter components for date ranges, accounts, material categories, transaction types, and a search bar to let users narrow down their view of transactions.\n\nLooking at the subtask breakdown, I can see the filters are split across subtasks 2 and 3, with the table, pagination, and new transaction button making up the rest of the interface. Let me verify this against the existing documentation patterns to make sure I'm organizing these consistently. I need to reconsider the scope of subtask 1 — it's just about deciding the component structure and adding the page section with placeholders to the docs, not filling in all the test details. The actual test content will come in subtasks 2 and 3 for specific components. So I'll add the TransactionsPage section header, list all the components, and create empty placeholder sections for each one. basic `TransactionsPageHeader` component with tests (since it's not covered by subtasks 2 or 3)\n4. Add placeholder headings for the other components (that will be filled in by subtasks 2 and 3)\n\nActually, re-reading the skill: the subtask says \"Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\". Looking at the later subtasks, they already specify the components. So I think in the PlanPage subtask, I should:\n1. Add the page section with component list\n2. Write tests for TransactionsPageHeader (the page header component that includes title, breadcrumb etc.)\n3. Add component headings for the filter components and table/pagination that will be filled in later\n\nLet me do this systematically.\n\nThe Transactions page would have:\n- Route: `/transactions`\n- A page header with title \"Transactions\" and breadcrumb\n- Filter controls like date range, account, material, transaction type, and search\n- A table showing all transactions with sortable columns\n- Pagination controls\n- A \"New Transaction\" button\n\nNow I'm mapping out the component structure. Subtask 2 handles the filter components (DateRangeFilter, AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, TransactionTypeFilter, SearchBar), while subtask 3 covers the table and pagination (TransactionsTable, Pagination, NewTransactionButton). So my component list is: TransactionsPageHeader, DateRangeFilter, AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, TransactionTypeFilter, SearchBar, TransactionsTable, Pagination, NewTransactionButton.\n\nFor the table columns, I need Date, Description, Account, Type (Debit/Credit), Amount, and Category/Material as tags.\n\nNow I'm considering what \"Material\" means in this accounting context—it likely refers to inventory items or goods associated with transactions, given this is part of a larger system with InventoryTracker and ProductionHub. The TransactionsTable will have sortable columns for Date, Description, Account, and Type.\n\nI'm planning to structure the implementation in stages: first adding the page skeleton, then the filter

The NewTransactionButton is still accessible to create the first transaction.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable empty state when filters produce no results**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with filters applied that match no transactions (e.g., AccountFilter set to a newly created account with no transactions).\n- **Action:** User observes the table area.\n- **Expected:** An empty state message is displayed (e.g., \"No transactions found matching your filters\") indicating no transactions match the current filter criteria. The filter controls remain accessible so the user can adjust or clear them.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable updates after saving a new transaction**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with existing transactions listed.\n- **Action:** User clicks the NewTransactionButton, fills in the NewTransactionModal with a new transaction (date: \"Nov 1, 2023\", description: \"Office Supplies\", account: Checking Account, type: Debit, amount: $75.00), and clicks \"Save Transaction\".\n- **Expected:** After the modal closes, the TransactionsTable updates to include the new \"Office Supplies\" transaction. The new row appears in the correct position based on the current sort order (e.g., at the top if sorted by date descending). The Pagination total updates to reflect the additional transaction.\n\n**Test: TransactionsTable updates after editing a transaction**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage. User clicks on the \"Grocery Store\" row to open it in the NewTransactionModal, changes the description to \"Grocery Store - Weekly\", and clicks \"Save Transaction\".\n- **Action:** User observes the TransactionsTable after the modal closes.\n- **Expected:** The \"Grocery Store\" row now displays the updated description \"Grocery Store - Weekly\". No duplicate row is created. All other columns remain unchanged.\n\n#### Component: Pagination\n\n**Test: Pagination displays below the TransactionsTable**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage with more transactions than fit on a single page (e.g., more than 10 or 20 transactions depending on page size).\n- **Action:** User observes the area below the TransactionsTable.\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are displayed below the table, showing the current page number, total pages, and navigation buttons. The controls include: a previous page button (left arrow), page number indicators, and a next page button (right arrow). A label such as \"Page 1 of 5\" or \"Showing 1–20 of 95 transactions\" is displayed.\n\n**Test: Pagination navigates to the next page**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the TransactionsPage viewing page 1 of transactions with pagination controls visible.\n- **Action:** User clicks the next page button (right arrow).\n- **Expected:** The TransactionsTable updates to display the next set of transaction rows (page 2).
