Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"41e54f33-bf82-4767-8b4e-3deb895f0fb3","uuid":"8ee835b3-ea94-48c4-8786-8fa86c5e6872","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

[2026-02-24T02:59:36.862Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01S5B5QxPGmibrLowweTLmVG","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"I can see the UserDetailPage section already exists in tests.md (lines 2750-2849) with all the components and test entries. Let me re-read the job descriptions:\n\n1. **PlanPageUserDetailPage**: Decide on components for UserDetailPage, add sections to docs/tests.md\n2. **PlanComponentUserInfo**: Add test entries for user info header (name, email, join date) and summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals)\n3. **PlanComponentUserSections**: Add test entries for owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed sections\n\nIt looks like the UserDetailPage section already exists with:\n\n\n- Components: UserDetailHeader, UserDetailStats, UserDealsList, UserTasksList, UserActivityFeed\n- UserDetailHeader tests (lines 2754-2779)\n- UserDetailStats tests (lines 2781-2793)\n- UserDealsList tests (lines 2795-2812)\n- UserTasksList tests (lines 2814-2831)\n- UserActivityFeed tests (lines 2833-2849)\n\nSo there's already content for these components! But looking at the strategy, the PlanPage job is about deciding on components and adding section headers. The PlanComponent jobs are about adding test entries. Let me check if the existing test entries match what the PlanComponent jobs are asking for.\n\nLooking at the spec, I need to verify the tests cover the key requirements: user info with name, email, and join date; summary stats for active deals, open tasks, and total deals; the owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and activity feed sections. I'm checking each component's test coverage against these requirements to see if anything's missing or needs adjustment. I'm checking whether the test coverage aligns with the strategy directives—specifically whether I've inventoried every visible element, verified navigation targets for clickable items, and confirmed button styling. Since there's no mockup image for the user detail page, I'm working from the text description, but I should verify if elements like the stats cards are interactive and might navigate to filtered views.\n\nLooking at potential gaps: error handling for invalid user IDs, zero-value stats display, currency and date formatting, priority and badge color coding in the deals and tasks lists, different activity event types with their specific text formats, and whether activity items are clickable navigation targets. I'm noticing the task descriptions mention adding sections and test entries, but those already exist in the codebase. Let me re-examine what each job is actually asking for to understand if there's additional work needed beyond what's already been documented. Looking at the directives more carefully, I'm noticing some gaps in the test coverage. I need to add tests for edge cases like invalid user IDs that should trigger error states, zero-value scenarios across the stats section, and specific visual formatting like deal stage badge colors and currency formatting. There are also missing tests for task priority indicators and action button interactions that should be verified.\n\nBut I'm second-guessing whether all of these are necessary or if I'm over-engineering the test suite. Let me compare against how similar detail pages handle this—looking at patterns in DealDetailPage and ClientDetailPage to see what level of granularity they actually test for.\n\nReading back through the existing UserDetailPage section, the coverage seems pretty solid already. These planning jobs might be artifacts from an earlier iteration before the content was fully written out. Since the actual test entries are already there and follow the same pattern as other pages, I should verify the component breakdown is sound and move forward. The spec doesn't explicitly mention clickable activity items, so I shouldn't assume that feature exists. Looking at how the deals and tasks lists handle navigation elsewhere in the test spec, I should maintain consistency rather than add untested interactions. I think the current tests cover the main scenarios well, so I'll focus on a few targeted additions to strengthen coverage. Looking at the specific test gaps across these components, I'm noticing that UserDealsList needs coverage for multiple deals and stage badge styling, UserTasksList is missing tests for multiple tasks and priority visual indicators, and UserActivityFeed needs to verify reverse chronological ordering of events.\n\nFor the additions, I'm thinking about what would meaningfully improve test coverage without over-engineering: error handling for non-existent users in UserDetailHeader, zero-state stats display, color-coded stage and priority badges across the deals and tasks lists, and potentially clickable activity entries that navigate to related entities.\n\nLooking back at the ClientDetailPage spec, I see that timeline events there are explicitly clickable and link to detail pages. The UserDetailPage activity feed likely follows the same pattern, so I should test that activity entries are clickable and navigate appropriately rather than treating them as static logs.\n\nNow I'll focus on what's actually missing from the test coverage. For the UserInfo component, I need to add tests for error states when a user doesn't exist and for edge cases like zero counts in the stats. For the UserSections component, I should verify that deal and task badges render with the correct styling based on their stage or priority level.\n\nLooking at how similar tests are structured in TasksListPage and DealsListPage, I can follow those patterns for consistency. Let me finalize which specific test cases to add and then make the

For the user info and stats, I should verify the error handling when navigating to an invalid user ID, and make sure stats properly display zero values when a user has no activity. The stats layout itself should follow a consistent grid pattern with icons, numbers, and labels. For the deals, tasks, and activity sections, I need to check that deal stage badges render with the correct colors, and ensure all the interactive elements work as expected. Now I'm identifying the specific test gaps across each component—things like handling non-existent users, zero-value stats, currency formatting for deals, priority badge colors for tasks, and ensuring the activity feed displays events in the right order with appropriate descriptions. I'll add these missing test entries to the docs.","signature":"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

Each row navigates to the correct individual's detail page based on their id.\n\n#### Pagination controls appear when contacts exceed page size\n- **Initial state:** The system has more than 50 contacts (e.g., 120 contacts).\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are displayed below the contacts table. The controls include a \"Previous\" button, numbered page buttons (e.g., 1, 2, 3), and a \"Next\" button. A text indicator shows \"Showing 1-50 of 120 contacts\". Each page shows up to 50 contacts.

The \"Next\" button is enabled. Page number 1 is highlighted.\n\n#### Next button is disabled on last page\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to the last page of contacts (e.g., page 3 of 120 contacts with 50 per page).\n- **Expected:** The \"Next\" button is disabled (visually grayed out and not clickable). The \"Previous\" button is enabled. The last page number is highlighted.

Instead, the search waits for the user to stop typing (debounce delay, e.g., 300ms) before filtering the table. This prevents excessive API calls or re-renders during rapid typing. After the debounce delay, the table updates to show contacts matching \"Sar\".\n\n#### Search input clears and shows all contacts\n- **Initial state:** The search input contains \"Sarah\" and only matching contacts are shown.\n- **Action:** User clears the search input (selects all text and deletes, or clicks a clear button if present).\n- **Expected:** All contacts are displayed again without any filter applied.

The name is prominent and clearly readable.\n\n#### Table rows display contact title\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with contacts that have titles (e.g., \"VP of Sales\", \"CTO\", \"Marketing Director\").\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the contact's title/role in the Title column (e.g., \"VP of Sales\", \"CTO\", \"Marketing Director\"). Contacts without a title show an empty cell or placeholder.\n\n#### Table rows display contact email\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with contacts that have email addresses.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the contact's email address in the Email column (e.g., \"sarah@acme.com\").

Each row navigates to the correct individual's detail page based on their id.\n\n#### Pagination controls appear when contacts exceed page size\n- **Initial state:** The system has more than 50 contacts (e.g., 120 contacts).\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are displayed below the contacts table. The controls include a \"Previous\" button, numbered page buttons (e.g., 1, 2, 3), and a \"Next\" button. A text indicator shows \"Showing 1-50 of 120 contacts\". Each page shows up to 50 contacts. The current page number (1) is visually highlighted/selected.\n\n#### Clicking Next loads the next page of contacts\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with pagination controls visible. User is on page 1.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Next\" button.\n- **Expected:** The contacts table updates to show the next page of contacts (contacts 51–100).

User is on page 1.\n- **Action:** User clicks page number \"3\".\n- **Expected:** The contacts table updates to show page 3 of contacts (contacts 101–120).

Both \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons reflect correct enabled/disabled state.\n\n#### Previous button is disabled on first page\n- **Initial state:** User is on page 1 of the contacts list.\n- **Expected:** The \"Previous\" button is disabled (visually grayed out and not clickable). The \"Next\" button is enabled. Page number 1 is highlighted.\n\n#### Next button is disabled on last page\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to the last page of contacts (e.g., page 3 of 120 contacts with 50 per page).\n- **Expected:** The \"Next\" button is disabled (visually grayed out and not clickable). The \"Previous\" button is enabled. The last page number is highlighted. The text indicator shows the remaining contacts (e.g., \"Showing 101-120 of 120 contacts\").\n\n#### Pagination updates when search reduces result count\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage shows 120 contacts with 3 pages of pagination.\n- **Action:** User types a search term that returns only 30 contacts.\n- **Expected:** The pagination controls update to reflect the filtered count. The text indicator shows \"Showing 1-30 of 30 contacts\". Since all results fit on one page, the \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons are both disabled and page numbers show only page 1.\n\n#### Pagination hidden when all results fit on one page\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded with fewer than 50 contacts (or search results return fewer than 50).\n- **Expected:** The pagination controls are either hidden or show a single page with no Previous/Next navigation needed.

Instead, the search waits for the user to stop typing (debounce delay, e.g., 300ms) before filtering the table. This prevents excessive API calls or re-renders during rapid typing. After the debounce delay, the table updates to show contacts matching \"Sar\".\n\n#### Search input clears and shows all contacts\n- **Initial state:** The search input contains \"Sarah\" and only matching contacts are shown.\n- **Action:** User clears the search input (selects all text and deletes, or clicks a clear button if present).\n- **Expected:** All contacts are displayed again without any filter applied.

Client Name is optional and performs a lookup by name against existing clients to create the association. A \"Download CSV template\" button is available. A file upload area or file picker is present for selecting a CSV file.\n\n#### ImportDialog CSV format specification is visible before upload\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog for contacts is open.\n- **Expected:** The CSV column format specification table is immediately visible to the user before they attempt any upload.
