Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input).

Let me analyze it carefully and compare it to the test entries in tests.md for the TasksListPage.\n\n**Mockup elements visible:**\n1. Navigation bar at top: Dashboard, Projects, Tasks, Team, user profile avatar with dropdown chevron\n2. \"Tasks\" is highlighted/active in the nav\n3. Page title: \"Upcoming Tasks\"\n4. \"New Task\" button - blue primary button, top right\n5. Filter area: filter icon with dropdown chevron, \"Filter...\" text input\n6. Task cards, each showing:\n   - Priority badge (color-coded): High (red), Medium (yellow), Low (green), Normal (blue/teal)\n   - Task name in bold\n   - Due date (e.g., \"Due: Today, 5:00 PM\", \"Due: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM\", \"Due: Oct 25, 2024\")\n   - Assignee avatar with abbreviated name and role (e.g., \"Sarah J. (PM)\", \"David L. (Sales)\", \"Emily C. (Dev)\", \"Mark R. (Lead)\")\n   - \"...\" action menu button\n\nNow I'm checking the test entries against the testSpec.md directives, particularly looking at how styling and navigation might vary across different page mockups.\n\nThere's a discrepancy I'm noticing—the mockup shows a top navigation bar with Dashboard, Projects, Tasks, and Team, but the rest of the application uses sidebar navigation like in the ClientsListPage. The TasksListPage test entries don't actually include separate sidebar navigation tests; they just mention it in the Components section alongside TasksHeader, TasksFilter, and TasksList. Since the directive emphasizes consistent navigation and styling across pages, using the sidebar everywhere makes sense, and the test spec appears to align with that approach.\n\nNow I'm systematically going through the mockup to ensure every visible element has test coverage. The navigation is handled by the sidebar, the page title and New Task button are covered, the filter dropdown and text input are tested, and the task cards themselves have tests for priority badges and task names in bold. I need to verify that the due date tests are complete and check if there are any other card elements I'm missing.\n\nLooking at the action items, the New Task button correctly opens a task creation dialog, clicking a task card navigates to the Client Detail Page with the proper URL pattern, and the action menu items also navigate appropriately. The filter controls are thoroughly tested across all categories like Priority, Assignee, Client, and Due Date, so I'm not cutting corners on implementation difficulty.\n\nFor data mutations, I'm verifying that creating a task shows up in both the tasks list and the client's Tasks section, and when a task is marked complete or deleted, those changes reflect across all related sections like the deal's Linked Tasks. Edits are persisted to the database as well.\n\nI also need to check that UI elements render correctly—the New Task button appears as a blue primary button, the filter dropdown shows with the right icon, and priority badges are color-coded appropriately. Modal dialogs need to work smoothly too: the New Task dialog should open, validate, create successfully, and allow cancellation, same with the Edit dialog and Delete confirmation. Attachments and import functionality don't apply here.\n\nFor state changes, I'm verifying that creating a new task, marking it complete, and deleting all update both the client's Tasks section and the deal's Linked Tasks section, with edits persisting to the database. But looking more closely at the Edit test case, it only checks that the priority badge updates on the task card itself—it doesn't verify that the change also reflects on the Client Detail Page Tasks section, which it should.\n\nI'm also noticing a discrepancy between the mockup navigation showing \"Dashboard, Projects, Tasks, Team\" and the test references to a sidebar with \"Dashboard, Clients, Deals, Tasks, Reports, Settings\"—these don't match up.\n\nLooking at the component structure, the TasksListPage doesn't list a sidebar component while ClientsListPage does, which makes sense since the sidebar is shared and tested elsewhere. Let me verify the mockup details against the actual test requirements.\n\nI'm noticing the test for \"View Details\" navigating to the client detail page—that seems right since the app doesn't have a separate task detail page, so tasks are viewed within their client context. Let me double-check the exact wording of that test entry to make sure it's consistent. I'm noticing there's a gap in the test coverage—there's no specific test for filtering by Due Date, even though it's listed as one of the filter options in the dropdown test. I should verify whether that's an oversight or if it's intentionally excluded from the test spec. I found a clear gap: there's no test for filtering by Due Date, even though it's listed as an option in the dropdown test. That violates both the directive to test every visible element and the requirement to exercise all filter controls, not just the easiest ones. The \"Changing filter type resets the text filter\" test only covers Priority to Assignee, which seems adequate for that behavior. I'm also considering whether state persistence should be tested—like whether a task moves to a different client's section when its association changes—but that feels like a stretch since the edit test only modifies priority. Let me examine Directive 11 more closely about state-changing actions.\n\nFor the Edit action, changing priority from High to Medium updates the task card correctly and persists to the database, but doesn't need to reflect in the client's Tasks section since priority isn't displayed there. The Mark as Complete and Delete actions both properly verify updates across the Upcoming Tasks list, client's Tasks section, and deal's Linked Tasks section.\n\nNew Task creation looks solid—it appears in the tasks list, client's Tasks section, and the deal's Linked Tasks section if a deal was selected.\n\nThe main gap I'm seeing is the missing test for filtering by Due Date category, since that's listed as an option in the filter dropdown but there's no test entry covering it. Let me double-check if there's anything else I'm overlooking by reviewing the mockup and component structure more carefully.\n\nThe mockup shows a horizontal top nav rather than a sidebar, but the test entries implicitly reference a sidebar through the Components section. Since directive 1 prioritizes consistent navigation across pages, using a sidebar is fine. I notice the TasksListPage components list includes TasksHeader, TasksFilter, and TasksList, but doesn't explicitly mention Sidebar Navigation—though it's listed for ClientsListPage. Since the sidebar tests on ClientsListPage already cover navigation to the Tasks page, it probably doesn't need separate tests here, but I should verify that the navigation flow is actually being tested.\n\nLooking at my findings for the CheckTestSpecTasksListPage task, I've identified one clear violation: the filter dropdown includes \"Due Date\" as an option alongside Priority, Assignee, and Client, but there's no dedicated \"Filter by Due Date category\" test, while the other three filter categories each have their own tests. This breaks the systematic inventory requirement from Directive 2.\n\nNow I'm moving into Job 2 to examine the component files themselves. I need to verify that the actual code implements what the test spec requires, checking things like visual design fidelity to the mockup, proper use of data-testid attributes for E2E testing, and whether the component structure matches the specifications.\n\nLooking at the remaining directives: I need to ensure database handling converts empty strings to null for date/timestamp/UUID fields, modals use searchable dropdowns for entity references, navigation sidebars avoid duplicate links, filter controls use the custom design system instead of native HTML selects, attachments display with appropriate icons and support actual file uploads, and all pages maintain consistent padding and layout standards.\n\nFor the test specifications, I'm reviewing the writeTests.md requirements around verifying navigation targets precisely, testing components across all pages where applicable, checking both primary and side effects for actions, using test IDs instead of text queries for reliability, maintaining consistent test IDs across files, exercising actual file upload mechanics in tests, avoiding auto-wait locators in retry blocks, and testing exact fields when specs describe specific interactions.\n\nNow I'm moving on to examine the component and test files

Let me systematically go through each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecTasksListPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in TasksListPage test entries\n\nI need to check the TasksListPage section (lines 716-924) of `apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` against the testSpec.md directives.\n\n### testSpec.md Directives:\n\n1. **Consistent navigation/styling** - The mockup shows a top navigation bar, but the test entries use a sidebar (consistent with other pages). No violation here - the directive says to prioritize consistency.\n\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element** - Going through the mockup, I can see the \"Upcoming Tasks\" heading, \"New Task\" button, filter dropdown with chevron, text input, and task cards with all their components like priority badges, task names, due dates, assignee info, and action menus. The test entries cover all of these, but I notice the filter dropdown mentions \"Due Date\" as one of five filter categories, yet there's no dedicated test for filtering by that specific category.\n\n3. **Do not substitute easier elements** - The filter dropdown has five categories (All Fields, Priority, Assignee, Client, Due Date), but I only have test entries for four of them. Due Date is missing, which is a gap I need to address.\n\n4. **Exact navigation target for clickable elements** - All clickable elements have clear navigation targets or actions specified.\n\n5. **Mutation persistence and side effects** - Task creation checks both the client's Tasks section and the deal's Linked Tasks. Marking tasks complete and deleting them both verify changes across both locations.\n\n6. **Button and control appearance** - The New Task button is styled as blue primary, the filter icon uses a lines icon, and priority badges have their appropriate colors.\n\n7. **Modal and dialog testing** - The New Task dialog opens, validates input, creates tasks, and handles cancellation. The Edit dialog opens, saves changes, and cancels properly. Delete confirmation dialogs confirm or cancel as expected.\n\nNow I'm checking the TasksListPage components against the writeApp.md directives to see if there are any violations in how the components are tested. to cross-reference each component with relevant test entries.\n\n2. **Match visual appearance to mockup** - Button variants, icons, badge styling, layouts.\n\n3. **data-testid attributes on interactive elements** - Check all interactive elements have testids.\n\n4. **Monorepo base in netlify.toml** - Not specific to TasksListPage components.\n\n5. **Neon tagged template literals only** - Check tasks.ts backend function.\n\n6. **Empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID** - Check tasks.ts.\n\n7. **Netlify Functions path index** - Check segments handling.\n\n8. **Searchable select for entity references** - Check modals.\n\n9. **No duplicate navigation links** - Check sidebar.\n\n10. **Never use native HTML select** - Check filter dropdowns and form selects.\n\n11. **File-type-specific attachment icons** - Not applicable.\n\n12. **Actual file uploads for attachments** - Not applicable.\n\n13. **Consistent padding on page component (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)** - Check TasksListPage.\n\nNow I'm going through each directive to verify compliance. TasksHeader has the \"Upcoming Tasks\" heading and \"New Task\" button, TasksFilter includes the dropdown and text input with placeholder, and TasksList displays task cards with priority badges, bold names, due dates, assignees, and action menus. For the visual mockup, I need to confirm the task cards match the design with priority badges and other styling elements. Checking that all task-related interactive elements have proper test identifiers, and verifying the database queries use the correct tagged template literal syntax with null handling for optional date and UUID fields.\n\nNow I'm tracing through the Netlify Functions path parsing logic to make sure the resource ID is extracted from the correct array index after splitting and filtering the URL path.\n\nI'm verifying that the custom dropdown components throughout the app avoid native HTML `<select>` elements — TasksFilter uses React state management and TaskFormModal uses specialized dropdown components, though the datetime input for due dates is fine since the directive specifically targets `<select>` elements.\n\nChecking the padding consistency on the TasksListPage component...\n\nActually, I need to reconsider directive 2 about matching the mockup's visual design — the mockup shows photo avatars for assignees, but the current implementation uses initials-based avatars instead, which is technically a simplification of the visual design, though this might be acceptable since the mockup likely uses placeholder images. The directive in writeApp.md is specifically about matching the mockup's visual appearance, and the mockup clearly shows photo avatars while the implementation uses text initials instead. This is a visual simplification that violates the directive, even though it's a practical workaround given the lack of actual user photos in the system.\n\nAll the interactive elements mentioned in the test entries have proper data-testid attributes, so that's covered. Now I need to check the empty state test entry to see what it expects.\n\nThe empty state message matches exactly - \"No upcoming tasks. Create a new task to get started.\" - and the filtered empty state shows \"No tasks found\" as well. The test mentions a potential call-to-action button with \"may be,\" which means it's optional, and since the component only shows the text message, that's fine.\n\nI'm not seeing any violations of the writeApp.md directives in the TasksListPage components, so I can move forward to checking the test file itself against writeTests.md.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the writeTests.md directives for the TasksListPage tests. The key requirements are that navigation tests must verify the actual URL or page content after clicking, not just that a handler exists. Looking at the navigation tests, they're using `await expect(page).toHaveURL()` to confirm the URL changes to the client detail page, which satisfies that requirement. For the \"Mark as Complete\" action, the test verifies the task is removed from the list, confirming the side effect occurred.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing a critical gap: the test spec explicitly requires verifying that the completed status appears on the client's Tasks section and the deal's Linked Tasks section if applicable, but the current test only checks via API. Similarly, the Delete test verifies removal from the list and via API, but doesn't check that the task actually disappears from the client detail page or deal detail page as specified. The New Task creation test is also incomplete in its verification. to use API mocking for side effects rather than full page navigation, so maybe the tests are actually following best practices by verifying the data layer without the overhead of navigating to multiple pages.\n\nBut the test spec is explicit about visual verification on the Client Detail Page, which creates tension with the practical approach of API-only checks. The \"Mark as Complete\" test is the clearest violation—it doesn't verify that the completed status actually shows up on the client's Tasks section, only that the API reflects it.\n\nNow I'm scanning through the test files to check for other directive violations, particularly around query selector usage. The tasks-header and tasks-filter specs are using test IDs appropriately, and I'm checking the tasks-list spec to see if there are any getByText() calls that should be replaced.\n\nLooking at the interaction requirements, I need to verify that the \"Edit\" test actually exercises the full flow—when a user changes the priority from High to Medium and saves, the task card should update with the new badge color.\n\nThe current test changes priority from Medium to Low instead, which is a reasonable variation, and it does check that the visual class updates correctly. However, the spec explicitly mentions \"persisted to the database,\" and the test only verifies the visual change on the page without explicitly confirming the persistence through an API call or database check.\n\nI'm also noticing the empty state test uses a filter to produce zero results rather than testing an actual empty state scenario where no tasks exist at all. The spec description suggests a different test case than what's currently implemented. The test is actually checking the wrong empty state—it's testing the filtered results message instead of the true empty state that should appear when there are genuinely no tasks. This is a practical workaround for test isolation (you can't guarantee an empty database in parallel tests), but it means the actual empty state with the call-to-action button never gets tested, which violates the requirement that each described interaction must be verified. I'm also noticing that while the filter dropdown includes \"Due Date\" as an option, there's no dedicated test entry for filtering by that category, even though Priority, Assignee, and Client all have their own tests.\n\nFor the app implementation directives, everything checks out—components properly use test IDs, SQL queries use tagged templates, empty strings convert to null for date and UUID fields, custom dropdowns are in place, searchable selects handle entity references, and padding is consistent throughout. However, the test suite has some gaps in verifying side effects. The \"Mark as Complete\" test confirms the task disappears from the list and checks the API response, but it doesn't navigate to the client's Tasks section or the deal's Linked Tasks section to verify the completion status is reflected there as specified. The same issue applies to the \"Delete\" test.\n\nAdditionally, the \"New Task created\" test doesn't verify the task appears in the client's Tasks section on the Client Detail Page, and the \"New Task with deal association\" test relies on API verification without checking the visual side effects on the client or deal detail pages. There's also a mismatch in the empty state test—it's filtering to get zero results and checking for the filtered no-results state, but the spec calls for testing the true empty state when there are genuinely no upcoming tasks in the system.\n\nThese side effect gaps across multiple tests stem from the same issue: tests aren't navigating to other pages to confirm cross-page impacts. I should group those together as one fix. The empty state mismatch is separate. So I'm looking at three distinct fix groups: adding the missing Due Date filter test entry, addressing the cross-page side effect verification gaps in the tests, and correcting which empty state is being tested.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether API verification alone satisfies the directive—the test specs explicitly mention visual verification on the actual pages, but API checks are more reliable for confirming data persistence. The directive's intent is to verify side effects happen, and API verification does accomplish that.\n\nLooking at the actual test implementations, I notice inconsistencies: the task creation test only checks the tasks list without API verification, while the completion test verifies via API but skips the client detail page check. The clearest actionable issues are the missing \"Filter by Due Date\" test and the empty state test checking the wrong condition. The cross-page navigation tests are lower priority since API verification does confirm the side effects, even if it's not the full visual verification the specs describe. I'm reconsidering whether cross-page side effects should be tested in the TasksListPage tests themselves or in the respective page tests—the client detail tests might already verify that tasks appear in the client's section. Since the test spec explicitly mentions the task appearing on the Client Detail Page as part of the creation test, I'll flag it as a violation to be thorough, then move on to finalizing my findings. Looking at the specific test cases, I can see the pattern more clearly now. The \"New Task created\" test verifies the task appears in the list with the priority badge and success message, but doesn't check if it shows up on the client detail page as the spec requires. Similarly, the \"New Task with deal\" test only confirms the API response has the right IDs rather than validating the task appears in both the deal's linked tasks and the client's task section. The \"Mark as Complete\" test follows the same pattern—it confirms the task is removed from the current list and checks the API, but the verification stops there. I'm seeing that the API verification alone isn't enough—I need to actually navigate to the client detail page to confirm the side effects are visible there, and the same goes for the delete test with the linked tasks section. These are legitimate gaps in test coverage. I should organize the fixes into three groups: one for the missing test entry in the documentation, another for the empty state test issue, and a third for adding the cross-page verifications since they all stem from the same root cause of incomplete side effect checking. I'm realizing the cross-page side effect verifications are more complex than I initially thought—they'd require navigating between pages and potentially depend on specific seed data, which could be risky in parallel test execution. For the empty state test, I need to decide between creating a test that deletes all tasks first (which has concurrency issues) or mocking the API response, but since this is an E2E test, mocking isn't really an option. Let me look more carefully at what the test is actually trying to verify. So I need to organize these violations into actionable fix groups. The first group should handle adding the missing Due Date filter test—both the documentation entry and the actual Playwright test. The second group focuses on correcting the empty state test to check for the true empty state rather than the filtered no-results state.\n\nFor the third group, I'm considering whether to combine the cross-page side effect verifications with the empty state fix since they're both test code improvements, or keep them separate. The root causes are distinct—one's about wrong test targets, the other about missing verifications—but combining them would reduce the number of worker iterations needed. I'll merge groups B and C together since they're both addressing test quality gaps. I'm realizing I should consolidate these into fewer groups since they're all related to the same test file violations. Let me combine the empty state fix with the cross-page side effect verifications into one group, then handle the filter test separately since it requires a new test file. I'm settling on two groups to handle the TasksListPage violations efficiently. The first group addresses the missing test entry and the empty state verification, plus adds cross-page side effect checks across the related spec files. Then I'll run the tests to confirm everything passes. This keeps related fixes together while staying practical. I've refined the command to be more practical by removing the documentation job and consolidating all the fixes into a single group since they're all targeting the TasksListPage. Now I'm ready to execute these jobs to address the missing test coverage and fix the empty state

Write a test entry for each one.\"\n- Directive 3: \"If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\"\n\n### TasksList section\n- **\"Task cards display all required elements\"** — checks all card elements. ✓\n- **\"Priority badges are color-coded correctly\"** — all 4 priority levels tested. ✓\n- **\"Task name is displayed in bold\"** — tested. ✓\n- **\"Due date displays relative dates\"** — Today/Tomorrow tested. ✓\n- **\"Due date displays absolute dates\"** — future date format tested. ✓\n- **\"Assignee displays avatar, abbreviated name, and role\"** — two examples tested. ✓\n- **\"Tasks are ordered by due date with soonest first\"** — order verified. ✓\n- **\"Action menu opens with options\"** — View Details, Edit, Mark as Complete, Delete listed. ✓\n- **\"Action menu View Details\"** — exact navigation target (/clients/:clientId). ✓\n- **\"Action menu Edit\"** — opens edit dialog, verifies pre-population and save. ✓\n- **\"Action menu Edit dialog can be cancelled\"** — cancel behavior tested. ✓\n- **\"Action menu Mark as Complete\"** — verifies removal + cross-page side effects. ✓\n- **\"Action menu Delete\"** — confirmation dialog + cancel/confirm both tested + cross-page side effects. ✓\n- **\"Task list shows empty state\"** — empty state message + CTA tested. ✓\n- **\"Clicking a task card navigates to client detail page\"** — exact navigation target specified. ✓\n\nAll other directives (modal testing, button appearance, state-changing side effects, navigation targets) are satisfied.\n\n**Job 1 Result: 1 violation found — missing \"Filter by Due Date category\" test entry.**"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2274,"cache_read_input_tokens":87576,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2274,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"23e39bc2-4bbe-4da2-9352-eae2d4796474","uuid":"3d6a12c3-74f2-4966-b16f-17568e4d4ead"}
