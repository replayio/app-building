Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"78c88dc6-4953-4452-8352-881c3e68ef13","uuid":"02c5112e-19fe-4299-84df-edc803d002cb","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":138,"startLine":1,"totalLines":138}}}

I also need to update the writeApp.md strategy to reference the apps/shared directory for shared components.

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"78c88dc6-4953-4452-8352-881c3e68ef13","uuid":"5a9baec1-cacd-4ecc-9457-668df88cd203","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7.

The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   253→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   254→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   255→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   256→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working.

Verify the API returns correctly\n   260→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   261→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   262→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   263→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   264→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   265→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   266→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   267→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   268→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.

If it modifies state (database,\n   files, processes), verify the state changes are correct.\n\n6. **Typecheck and lint**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint .` to verify no errors.\n\n7.

Let me think about what I need to do:\n\n1. Queue build tasks for each of the 5 apps (InventoryTracker, ProductionHub, Accounting, SalesCRM, SupplierTracker) following the buildInitialApp.md strategy\n2. Update the writeApp strategy to reference an `apps/shared` directory for shared components\n\nThe buildInitialApp strategy says to add these 6 stages per app, all with `--trailing`:\n1. testSpec.md\n2. writeApp.md\n3. writeScript.md\n4. writeTests.md\n5. testing.md\n\n\n6. deployment.md\n\nI need to figure out how to pass the app name to each subtask. The strategies reference relative paths like \"AppSpec.md\" and \"docs/tests.md\", but they need to know which app directory they're working in. Since the apps live in subdirectories like `apps/SalesCRM`, the subtask descriptions need to include the app name so workers know which directory to operate in.\n\nI'm thinking the subtask descriptions should follow the pattern from checkDirectives.md, embedding the context directly—something like \"Unpack: Write test specification for InventoryTracker\". This way each of the 6 tasks queued for buildInitialApp will be specific to its app.\n\nFor the shared components strategy, I'm realizing that apps like AppStyle.md and common UI patterns (sidebar navigation, tables) could live in `apps/shared` to avoid duplication across InventoryTracker, SalesCRM, and the other apps.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":9044,"cache_read_input_tokens":45961,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":9044,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"78c88dc6-4953-4452-8352-881c3e68ef13","uuid":"5eaaf52b-41de-43d3-b5b2-68060621dca8"}

Let me analyze the common patterns across the 5 apps:\n\n1. **InventoryTracker**: Accounts, Materials, Batches, Transactions, Dashboard, Settings - data tables, detail pages, forms, double-entry accounting\n2. **ProductionHub**: Recipes, Calendar, Runs, Equipment - calendar views, data tables, detail pages, forms\n3. **Accounting**: Accounts, Transactions, Reports, Budgets - data tables, modals, detail pages, reporting\n4. **SalesCRM**: Clients, Deals, Tasks, People, Contacts, Settings - data tables, detail pages, forms, attachments, timelines, authentication\n\n\n5. **SupplierTracker**: Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders - data tables, detail pages, documents/attachments\n\nLooking at what ties these together, they all use the same sidebar navigation with main content layout following AppStyle.md, and every one relies heavily on searchable data tables, detail pages with sectioned content, modals for create/edit operations, and consistent form elements like inputs, dropdowns, and date pickers. Status badges and filter/search bars appear throughout as well.\n\nBeyond the UI layer, there's a lot of repetition in how data flows through these apps—CRUD operations, database utilities with Neon connections, Netlify Functions for backend endpoints, and Redux slices with async thunks for API calls. A few apps also share specific features like document attachments and comment systems, plus there's potential to unify authentication across everything.\n\nI'm thinking through how to structure the shared directory to capture all this. The components folder would hold the reusable pieces like the sidebar layout, a flexible data table with filtering and sorting, detail page headers with action buttons, filter bars, and modals. This should eliminate a lot of duplication across the five apps.\n\nFor utilities, I'd centralize the Neon database setup, API fetch wrappers with error handling, date formatting, and CSV utilities. The styles folder pulls in the CSS variables and base component styles, while the Redux and Netlify folders establish patterns for store setup and backend middleware like authentication and database operations.\n\nNow I'm drafting a comprehensive update to the writeApp.md documentation.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4110,"cache_read_input_tokens":62207,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4110,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":13,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"78c88dc6-4953-4452-8352-881c3e68ef13","uuid":"6cc5a38d-db4c-4c0a-a781-a37627c762a6"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --strategy \"strategies/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --strategy \"strategies/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":27,"oldLines":6,"newStart":27,"newLines":89,"lines":[" - All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files."," - Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific).

This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root.

Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n   129→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n   130→\n   131→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n   132→\n   133→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n   134→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n   135→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n   136→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n   137→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n   138→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n   139→\n   140→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n   141→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n   142→contexts (testing, deployment).\n   143→\n   144→## Directives\n   145→\n   146→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n   147→\n   148→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n   149→\n   150→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n   151→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n   152→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n   153→\n   154→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n   155→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n   156→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n   157→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   158→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n   159→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n   160→\n   161→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n   162→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n   163→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n   164→\n   165→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n   166→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n   167→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n   168→\n   169→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n   170→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n   171→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n   172→\n   173→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n   174→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n   175→\n   176→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n   177→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n   178→  to the same destination.\n   179→\n   180→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n   181→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n   182→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n   183→\n   184→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n   185→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n   186→  icon for all attachment types.\n   187→\n   188→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n   189→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   190→\n   191→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   192→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   193→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   194→\n   195→## Tips\n   196→\n   197→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   198→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   199→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   200→  ```ts\n   201→  build: {\n   202→    sourcemap: true,\n   203→    minify: false,\n   204→  },\n   205→  define: {\n   206→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   207→  },\n   208→  ```\n   209→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   210→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   211→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   212→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   213→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   214→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   215→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   216→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   217→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   218→  when the prop changes.

When building something\nthat is clearly reusable across apps (not domain-specific), add it to `apps/shared/` so other\napps can use it.\n\nApps import from shared using relative paths (e.g., `import { DataTable } from '../../shared/components/DataTable'`).\nConfigure a TypeScript path alias in each app's `tsconfig.json` for cleaner imports:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@shared/*\": [\"../shared/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd a corresponding Vite alias in `vite.config.ts`:\n\n```ts\nresolve: {\n  alias: {\n    '@shared': path.resolve(__dirname, '../shared'),\n  },\n},\n```\n\n### What belongs in `apps/shared/`\n\n**`apps/shared/components/`** — Reusable React UI components that appear in multiple apps:\n- `AppLayout` — Sidebar + main content layout shell following `AppStyle.md`\n- `Sidebar` — Navigation sidebar with active-page highlighting\n- `DataTable` — Filterable, sortable, paginated data table using CSS Grid (per AppStyle.md)\n- `DetailPageHeader` — Entity detail page header with title, metadata, and action buttons\n- `FilterBar` — Search input + dropdown filter controls\n- `FilterSelect` — Custom styled dropdown (never native `<select>`)\n- `Modal` — Base modal dialog with form support\n- `ConfirmDialog` — Confirmation modal for destructive actions\n- `StatusBadge` — Color-coded status indicator using CSS variables\n- `EmptyState` — Placeholder for empty lists/tables\n- `LoadingSpinner` — Loading indicator\n- `Pagination` — Page controls for large data sets\n- `AttachmentList` — File list with type-specific icons/thumbnails\n- `FileUpload` — File picker with drag-and-drop support\n- `CommentSection` — Threaded comments/notes with add/delete\n- `Timeline` — Chronological activity feed\n\n**`apps/shared/lib/`** — Shared utilities:\n- `db.ts` — Neon serverless client setup (tagged template literal helper)\n- `api.ts` — Frontend fetch wrappers with error handling\n- `dates.ts` — Date formatting and parsing utilities\n- `csv.ts` — CSV import/export helpers\n- `colors.ts` — Status color mappings from AppStyle.md\n\n**`apps/shared/styles/`** — Shared CSS:\n- `variables.css` — CSS custom properties from `AppStyle.md` (palette, typography, spacing)\n- `base.css` — Reset and base typography styles\n\n**`apps/shared/netlify/`** — Shared backend utilities for Netlify Functions:\n- `db.ts` — Backend Neon connection helper (accepts URL parameter, uses tagged template syntax)\n- `response.ts` — Standard JSON response helpers (success, error, 404)\n- `middleware.ts` — Optional auth middleware, CORS headers\n- `parse-path.ts` — URL path parsing with correct index handling for function name vs resource ID\n\n### When NOT to use shared\n\n- Domain-specific components that only make sense for one app (e.g., a transaction double-entry\n  form, a recipe builder, a deal pipeline board).\n- Components with highly app-specific props or behavior that would require excessive configuration\n  to generalize.\n- When in doubt, start app-specific and extract to shared only when a second app needs the same thing.\n\n### Building shared code\n\nThe first app that needs a shared component creates it in `apps/shared/`. Subsequent apps import\nit directly. If a later app needs the component to behave slightly differently, extend it via\nprops — do not fork it into an app-specific copy. Keep shared components flexible through\ncomposition (children, render props) rather than accumulating app-specific flags.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":233,"startLine":1,"totalLines":233}}}
