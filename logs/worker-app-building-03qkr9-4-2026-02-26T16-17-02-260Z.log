The skill says:\n\n1. Read `docs/tests.md` to understand the existing application structure\n2. Add one task per page using `add-task`\n3. Also add a separate task for non-page specific checks (backend)\n\nBut first, I need to figure out which app I'm working with. Let me check the task queue to see what app is associated with this task, and then read the tests.md file.\n\nLet me look at the task file and find which app this is for.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2757,"cache_read_input_tokens":23652,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2757,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d10a55c7-b2fd-4289-a039-26d87f55aacd","uuid":"447929bb-c3ff-41be-93a7-941924438461"}
