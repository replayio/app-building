No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings.

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch.

Let me go through them one by one.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecCalendarPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in CalendarPage test entries\n\nI need to check the CalendarPage section of docs/tests.md (lines 320-618) against the testSpec.md directives:\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements. Prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler alternatives when the mockup specifies particular elements.\n4. Every clickable element needs its exact navigation target or action result documented in the test.\n5. When user actions change data, I need test entries confirming the persistence and all expected side effects.\n6. Button styling, text, and icons must match what's shown in the mockup.\n7. Modal dialogs require comprehensive testing to ensure they function correctly.\n8. File uploads should be supported in attachment functionality unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs need to specify their expected behavior.\n10. Configurable backend integrations must have complete setup instructions visible in the UI.\n11. State-changing actions need tests verifying that other parts of the app update in response.\n\nNow I'm going through the CalendarHeader test entries to check if they align with these requirements. CAL-HDR-1 looks fine—it's just verifying the page title exists. But CAL-HDR-2 is checking that a Prev button displays, and per the button appearance directive, it should verify the icon as well as the text, not just confirm the button exists.\n\nThe rest of the entries seem solid—CAL-HDR-3 through CAL-HDR-5 verify the Today button and month/year display are present. CAL-HDR-6 through CAL-HDR-8 test the navigation functionality, which is good. CAL-HDR-9 and CAL-HDR-10 cover the view toggle and default selection, and CAL-HDR-11 starts checking what happens when you click the Daily toggle.\n\nNow looking at the next batch: the Daily, Weekly, and Monthly toggles all specify the view changes along with date format and navigation behavior, which is thorough. CAL-HDR-14 checks that the New Production Run button appears with the right styling and position. CAL-HDR-15 is testing the modal that opens when you click that button—it needs to have the right fields, accept input, close properly, and persist the new event, which aligns with the directive about testing modal dialogs thoroughly.\n\nBut I'm noticing a gap here: the test only covers the happy path of filling in the form and submitting. It doesn't test what happens when you click the cancel button, the close X button, or click outside the modal to dismiss it. The component clearly has these elements (`new-run-cancel-btn`, `new-run-modal-close`, and an overlay with an onClick handler), so there's a potential gap in coverage for the modal's complete behavior. The status filter tests that follow look solid—they check the dropdown displays correctly and that filtering actually hides non-matching runs. The remaining grid tests cover event status colors for Scheduled, In Progress, and Pending Approval states, multi-day event spanning, event interaction through the details popup, stacked events on the same day, empty cells, drag-and-drop rescheduling with confirmation and persistence, canceling drag operations, and switching between weekly and daily views.\n\nNow I'm checking the RunDetailsPopup component, verifying it displays all the essential run information including title, start and end times, quantity, status, materials, and notes, along with the Edit Run button that navigates to the run details page and a functional close button.\n\nI'm also noting that the popup handles edge cases like empty notes and material shortage indicators, and can be dismissed either through the close button or by clicking outside the modal.\n\nLooking at the test coverage against the directives, I notice the New Run Modal opened by CAL-HDR-15 is missing test entries for several dismissal methods—specifically the cancel button, the close button, and clicking the overlay to close it, which appears to be a gap in the modal dialog testing requirements.\n\nThe happy path for creating a new run is covered, and I can see that data persistence is being verified in both the modal creation test and the drag-and-drop rescheduling test, which aligns with the directives. I should also verify that the form validation for the New Run Modal is fully tested.\n\nLooking at the component code, the submit button is disabled when either the start or end date is missing, but I don't see a test entry that explicitly covers this validation behavior. The directive about completely testing modal dialogs should include validation states. That's a gap.\n\nThe main issue I'm identifying is that there's no test coverage for the cancel or close functionality of the New Production Run modal—only the happy path of submitting is tested. This violates the directive about thoroughly testing modal dialogs.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the CalendarPage components against the writeApp.md directives. test entries and make sure requirements are satisfied.\n3. Match visual appearance to mockup.\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything E2E tests will need to target.\n5. In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory, add `base = \"apps/...\"` to netlify.toml.\n6. When using neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax.\n7. For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, convert empty strings to null before inserting.\n8. Netlify Functions resource ID at path index 3.\n9. When building modals that reference other entities, use a searchable select/dropdown component.\n10. Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links.\n11. Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls.\n12. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons.\n13. Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.\n14. Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`).\n15. Components should be layout-agnostic.\n\nNow I'm going through each component to verify compliance. CalendarPage has the required testid on its root, but I need to verify the page-content class actually applies the correct padding directive. For CalendarHeader, the testids are in place on interactive elements, and I'm checking whether the searchable select requirement is properly

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\"\n\nNone of the CalendarPage components have these JSX comments. This is a violation of the testSpec.md requirement. However, looking at the context, this seems like it might be a directive that's been consistently not followed across the entire app. Let me check if any components in the app have these comments.\n\nActually wait - this is listed under \"Requirements\" not \"Directives\" in testSpec.md. The task says to check \"testSpec.md directive violations.\" The Requirements section says:\n\n\nI need to distinguish between the Requirements and Directives sections in testSpec.md. The task specifically asks me to check directive violations, not requirements, so I should focus only on what's listed under the Directives section rather than the Requirements section.\n\nLooking at the directives themselves: I need to ensure comprehensive test coverage of every visible element in the mockups, avoid substituting simpler implementations for what's actually shown, and specify exact navigation targets or action results for all clickable elements. I need to add directive 11 about state-changing actions and their side effects, then systematically review the CalendarPage test entries. I'm finding that the New Production Run modal violates directive 7 because it only tests the happy path—there are no test entries for the cancel button, close button, or clicking outside to dismiss it. I'm also starting to check directive 4 against all clickable elements to see if navigation targets and action results are properly specified. I've verified the event interactions—clicking opens a popup, dragging reschedules the run, and the popup can be closed either through the close button or by clicking outside. I notice the modal's cancel and close buttons haven't been tested yet, which relates to the directive 7 violation I flagged earlier.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking which visible elements have test coverage. The header components are all accounted for—the title, navigation buttons, period display, view toggles, and the new run button. The calendar grid itself shows good coverage too, with the day columns, cells, and event cards all tested.\n\nLooking at the popup elements, those are covered as well. The multi-day event spans and both weekly and daily view modes are tested. I'm also verifying the non-visual directives—consistency isn't directly testable from the test entries, but the substitution and mutation persistence checks appear to be in place. This feels like solid coverage across the board.\n\nThe one gap I'm noticing is that there's no test entry for what happens when someone cancels or closes the New Run Modal. Beyond that, the state-changing actions like creating and rescheduling runs both properly update the calendar grid, which is good. Now I should move on to examining the components themselves.\n\nLooking at the writeApp.md directives for component checks, I need to verify that all interactive elements have proper `data-testid` attributes, ensure the visual design matches the mockup, and confirm that things like modals use searchable dropdowns instead of native HTML selects for entity references.\n\nNow I'm going through each component to validate compliance. CalendarPage has the correct responsive padding and includes the necessary test ID, with all subcomponents properly composed. For CalendarHeader, I'm checking that all interactive elements have the required data-testid attributes... I've verified all the testids for the New Run Modal form fields and buttons, and confirmed that the recipe selection uses a searchable input while the status filter uses a custom dropdown instead of native selects.\n\nNow I'm checking the CalendarGrid component to ensure it has the proper testids across all its views—the month view with day headers and event cells, the weekly view with its own header structure, and the daily view with hourly cells—plus the reschedule tooltip elements. Finishing up the RunDetailsPopup test IDs and confirming the modal overlay behavior—everything looks compliant with the directives so far, but I want to verify that the overlay's click handler properly closes the modal without triggering unintended actions.\n\nNow moving into Subtask 3 to check the CalendarPage tests against writeTests.md, specifically looking at whether navigation assertions are precise and whether components tested across multiple pages are properly validated in each context. continuing through the test guidelines and now reviewing the calendar-header test file to verify each spec entry has proper coverage. also visible. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-4**: Checks Next button visibility and text. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-5**: Checks period label with current month/year. ✓ Uses `toHaveText` with exact expected string.\n\n**CAL-HDR-6**: Prev button navigation.\n- Checks period label changes ✓\n- Computes expected previous month ✓\n- Verifies calendar grid is still visible ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-7**: Next button navigation. Similar to above. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-8**: Today button navigation. Goes Prev twice, then clicks Today, verifies returns to original. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-9**: View toggle display. Checks all three buttons visible with correct text. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-10**: Monthly view default. Checks active class, non-active classes, monthly grid visible. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-11**: Daily toggle switch. Verifies Daily becomes active while Monthly loses active, the daily grid appears, period label updates to daily format, and Prev navigates by day. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-12**: Weekly toggle switch. Similar pattern to daily. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-13**: Monthly toggle return. Switches to weekly first, then back to monthly. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-14**: New Production Run button. Checks visibility and text. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-15**: New Production Run modal submission. Opens the modal, verifies all form fields are visible, and starts selecting values.\n\nContinuing with the modal test—selecting a recipe from the dropdown, filling in dates and quantity, then submitting to verify the modal closes and the event appears on the calendar. Also navigates away and back to confirm persistence, using slow test mode with generous timeouts. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-16**: Filter button display. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-17**: Filter dropdown options. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-18**: Filter hides non-matching runs. Creates two runs with different statuses, applies the filter, and checks visibility accordingly with proper cleanup. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-19**: Filter \"All\" shows all runs. ✓\n\n**CAL-HDR-20**: Legend display. ✓\n\nNow moving into the calendar grid tests. **CAL-GRID-1**: Column headers. ✓\n\n**CAL-GRID-2**: Day cells with date numbers. Uses slow test mode, checks sample days, and counts day cells via page evaluation without violating auto-wait directives. Also verifies dimmed cells for previous month dates. ✓\n\n**CAL-GRID-3**: Event cards on correct dates. Creates a run through the API and confirms it appears in the right cell with proper cleanup. ✓\n\n**CAL-GRID-4**: Event card format. Checking the regex pattern for the card text...\n\nthe test retrieves text content from the first event card, which is fine since the element was already waited for visibility. Also confirming no `getByText` usage with common words across the CalendarPage tests—they stick to `getByTestId`. ✓\n\n**CAL-GRID-5-9**: Status color tests. All create runs via API and verify the CSS classes, with cleanup in finally blocks. ✓\n\n**CAL-GRID-10**: Multi-day events. Creates a run spanning Monday to Friday, checks the span class and confirms intermediate cells don't have duplicate renders. ✓\n\n**CAL-GRID-11**: Click...\n\nReviewing the remaining test cases. **CAL-GRID-12** stacks multiple events and verifies both appear in the same cell. **CAL-GRID-13** checks that empty day cells have no events. **CAL-GRID-14** tests drag-and-drop rescheduling with `test.slow()`, dragging an event from day 16 to 15, confirming the tooltip appears, accepting the reschedule, verifying the event moved, and checking persistence after reload. **CAL-GRID-15** covers drag cancellation with `test.slow()` as well.\n\nFor the drag cancel test, I'm using `page.evaluate` to manually trigger drag events since that's more reliable with Replay browsers, and the tooltip appears and disappears correctly when the drag is cancelled. **CAL-GRID-16** and **CAL-GRID-17** switch between weekly and daily views to verify the headers and structure display properly. Moving into the popup tests now, starting with **CAL-POP-1** checking the title displays the recipe name, **CAL-POP-2** validating the start date/time format with regex, and **CAL-POP-3** for the end date/time.\n\nContinuing through the popup spec, I'm verifying the quantity field, status badge, materials list with a fallback for \"no materials\", notes field, and the Edit Run button. For **CAL-POP-9**, I'm extracting the run ID from the testid, clicking Edit Run, and confirming navigation to the correct `/runs/{runId}` path. The close button test checks that the popup closes and the calendar remains visible.\n\nFor **CAL-POP-12**, I'm testing the empty notes scenario by creating a run without notes through the API, opening the popup, and verifying the \"No notes\" text displays. **CAL-POP-13** navigates to March 2026 to find the Material Shortage event and checks for the shortage indicator class. **CAL-POP-14** tests that clicking outside the popup on the overlay closes it.\n\nI've also scanned for any `.toPass()` usage with auto-wait behavior and didn't find any violations of that directive.\n\nNow I'm verifying the remaining directives: there are no `beforeEach` hooks with unnecessary cleanup, the test files use consistent data-testid naming conventions like `calendar-event-{id}` and `run-details-popup`, most assertions have generous timeouts of 15000 or 30000 milliseconds for backend operations, and the multi-step test flows like CAL-HDR-15, CAL-GRID-2, CAL-GRID-10, CAL-GRID-12, and CAL-GRID-14 are marked with `test.slow()`.\n\nLooking at the test files overall, I don't see any violations against the writeTests.md directives—the tests are well-structured with proper timeouts, cleanup patterns, no anti-patterns like `.toPass()` for flaky assertions, and consistent test identifiers throughout.\n\nLet me double-check one specific case: CAL-GRID-12 uses a selector to count events in a cell and verifies there are at least two, which is fine since the `count()` method has auto-wait semantics but isn't wrapped in `.toPass()`, so it follows the directive correctly.\n\nAfter reviewing all three specification files, I found only one violation: the NewRunModal in CalendarHeader has multiple dismissal methods (Cancel button, Close button, and overlay click-to-close) but there are no test entries covering these, which violates the directive about thoroughly testing modal dialogs. I'll create a task to add those missing test
