Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches.

Let me now systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientDetailPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage test entries\n\nI need to check the ClientDetailPage test entries (section 2 in docs/tests.md) against the testSpec.md directives.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n\n3. I need to avoid substituting simpler elements for what's actually shown in the mockup — if the design calls for complex columns with joins or computed values, I test all of them, and if there are four filter controls, I test all four rather than just the easiest ones.\n4. Every clickable element requires a specific navigation target or action result in the test entry, with no ambiguity about where buttons lead or how external flows like OAuth or payments open and complete.\n5. For any action that changes data, I need to write test entries that verify the mutation happens correctly.\n6. Button and control appearance — text, icons, styling — must match what the mockup shows, not just confirm that some button exists.\n7. Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they work properly.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format and verify that format documentation is visible to users before they attempt the import.\n10. Backend integrations that users can configure, like webhooks or OAuth apps, need complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n11. Any action that changes state requires test coverage.\n\nNow I'm going through the ClientDetailPage test entries to check that state-changing actions trigger the right side effects — particularly that mutations write history entries atomically without duplicates. Looking at the ClientHeader tests, I notice that CDP-HDR-05 tests editing client type and persistence, but doesn't specify a timeline entry, which seems like a gap since other mutations like name, status, and tags all track history.\n\nFor QuickActions, the task and deal creation tests both verify persistence and timeline entries correctly, and the attachment dialog test is checking that the upload interface works.\n\nFor SourceInfoSection, I'm noticing that the source info edit test doesn't include a timeline entry verification—if mutations are being tracked, that's another potential gap against the directives.\n\nFor TasksSection, I'm checking the completion workflow and whether all state changes are properly logged.\n\nFor DealsSection and AttachmentsSection, I'm verifying display and navigation work correctly, though I'm questioning whether attachment deletion really needs a timeline entry since it wasn't mentioned in the timeline section's scope.\n\nNow looking at PeopleSection and TimelineSection—those tests all pass, covering display, navigation, and the atomicity of key events like task creation and deal stage changes. But I'm noticing a potential gap: CDP-HDR-05 tests that type changes persist, yet it doesn't verify a timeline entry gets created, while the name, status, and tag change tests do mention timeline entries. That inconsistency might be worth flagging.\n\nSimilarly, CDP-SRC-03 confirms source edits persist but doesn't reference a timeline entry either. And while there's an atomicity test for deal stage changes and task creation, I don't see one specifically for status changes—though ATOM-03 in the cross-cutting section does cover that. But name and tag changes lack atomicity tests altogether, which could be another gap to address.\n\nLooking back at the directive itself, it's asking for test entries that verify both the data persists AND that exactly the right side effects happen—meaning one timeline entry per action, no duplicates. So when CDP-HDR-02 says \"A timeline entry is created for the name change,\" it should be explicitly confirming that persistence and the single timeline entry occur together.\n\nScanning through the test entries, most of them mention timeline creation but don't explicitly state \"exactly one\"—that's a gap. CDP-HDR-05 and CDP-SRC-03 don't mention timeline entries at all, which looks like violations of the directive. CDP-TSK-02 is cut off mid-sentence, but the pattern suggests it should also be verifying timeline atomicity.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether source information changes should trigger timeline entries at all. The timeline section lists specific event types—task created, note added, deal stage changed, email sent, contact added—and source changes aren't among them. But the directive says to think through every field that can change, so there's some tension there.\n\nLooking at directive 7 about modal dialogs, I'm checking whether each modal is properly tested. The Add Task, Add Deal, and Add Attachment modals all have opening and creation tests, and the Add Person modal appears to follow the same pattern.\n\nBut I'm noticing the tests mention Save and Cancel buttons without explicit test cases for the Cancel behavior itself. The directive asks for complete modal testing, and cancellation is definitely part of proper modal functionality—that could be a gap.\n\nLet me recalibrate though. Testing cancel on every single modal might be excessive, even if it would be thorough. I should be more measured about what constitutes a real oversight versus being overly strict.\n\nI also need to check directive 2 about inventorying every visible element in the mockups, but without access to the actual images, I'm limited to working from the component descriptions provided. Looking at what's listed, the ClientHeader includes the client name, type badge, status badge, tags, and edit functionality.\n\nNow I'm going through each section systematically—QuickActions, SourceInfoSection, TasksSection, DealsSection, AttachmentsSection, PeopleSection, and TimelineSection all appear to have their key elements covered in the test cases. Before I flag anything as a violation, I need to be careful about distinguishing between genuine gaps and unreasonable expectations.\n\nLooking at the actual violations: the type change mutation stands out as genuinely missing a timeline entry, which is inconsistent since status changes, name changes, and tag changes all create timeline entries. The directives emphasize tracking every mutation's side effects, and given how significant a type change is in a CRM context, this omission seems like a real oversight rather than a marginal concern.\n\nSource info changes are murkier—the timeline doesn't list them as tracked events, and administrative metadata changes might legitimately not warrant timeline entries in this app, so that feels more debatable. Now I need to check whether the modal dialogs have proper cancel test coverage, since the directive calls for completely testing modal functionality. Looking at the attachment upload tests, CDP-QA-06 and CDP-QA-07 cover the file upload dialog and actual file upload, which satisfies the directive about attachment functionality. Now I'm identifying the key violations: CDP-HDR-05 is missing a timeline entry when the header type changes, which violates directives about side effects and state-changing actions since all other header edits include timeline entries. Additionally, the modal dialogs for adding tasks and deals lack explicit cancel button tests, which violates the directive requiring complete modal dialog testing. I'm overthinking the granularity here—let me step back and focus on the clearest violations. I should systematically check each testSpec.md directive against the actual ClientDetailPage test entries to see what's missing. Starting with the inventory directive: I need to verify that all visible elements mentioned in the component descriptions have corresponding test coverage, checking things like the ClientHeader elements (name, badges, tags, edit icon) and QuickActions buttons.\n\nContinuing through the sections—SourceInfoSection covers source, campaign, channel, date acquired, and edit button; TasksSection has heading, unresolved label, checkboxes, due dates, and deal associations; DealsSection covers heading, deal name, stage, and value; AttachmentsSection includes heading, file preview, filename, type label, date, deal link, download, and delete; PeopleSection has heading, avatar, name, and role; and TimelineSection has heading and events.\n\nNow checking the directives—all elements appear to be accounted for, there are no obvious substitutions to make, and the navigation targets are properly specified with exact paths for tasks, deals, and individuals. For mutations, I'm verifying that persistence and timeline entries are being tracked correctly across the relevant components.\n\nI'm finding that most directives are satisfied, though there are a couple of issues: CDP-HDR-05 is missing its timeline entry, and CDP-SRC-03 might not need one depending on whether source info changes warrant timeline documentation. The rest of the mutations show proper persistence and timeline handling where applicable. , timeline entry not mentioned for deletion\n\nHmm, let me think about CDP-QA-07 (attachment upload) and CDP-ATT-04 (attachment delete). The timeline section lists these event types: \"task created, note added, deal stage changed, email sent, contact added.\" Attachment events aren't listed. But the directive says to think through what needs history tracking. For a CRM, tracking when documents are added/removed seems important.\n\nActually, wait - these are guidelines for the test spec author. The test spec author already decided which events to track in the timeline. The test entries just need to be consistent with that. The fact that the timeline doesn't list attachment events suggests the spec author decided they don't need tracking. That's a design decision, not a violation.\n\nBut CDP-HDR-05 (type change) IS inconsistent because ALL other header field edits create timeline entries. This is clearly an oversight.\n\nNow checking the button and control appearance requirements - the four action buttons are all properly tested with their icons and labels, and the attachment preview handling covers both file type icons and image thumbnails. For the modal dialog testing, I'm seeing that opening and creation flows are covered across all modals, but cancel behavior hasn't been tested for any of them, which is a clear gap. are create-only)\n- Validation not tested (e.g., what happens if required fields are empty?) ← POSSIBLE VIOLATION\n\nActually, for \"completely test,\" I think the lack of cancel tests is a genuine issue. At minimum, one modal should have a cancel test to verify the modal closes without saving.\n\n**Directive 8** (attachment file uploads): \n- CDP-QA-06: \"file upload (drag & drop or file picker) or link URL entry\" ✓\n- CDP-QA-07: \"Upload a file 'Report.pdf'\" ✓\n✓\n\n**Directive 9** (import/upload format documentation): No import dialogs on ClientDetailPage. N/A ✓\n\n**Directive 10** (backend integration setup instructions): No backend integration configuration on ClientDetailPage. N/A ✓\n\n**Directive 11** (state-changing actions update other parts): I've got tests covering task creation, deal creation, and person addition all flowing into timeline entries, plus atomicity checks for task completion and deal stage changes. The cross-cutting atomicity tests handle the main scenarios, though I'm noticing potential gaps around tag changes, name changes, and contact additions—though these might already be covered by the broader tests.\n\nSo my final violations are: CDP-HDR-05 missing a timeline entry test, and the lack of modal cancel tests. Everything else appears to be addressed.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether source info changes should also create timeline entries. The directive is clear that every mutation the timeline tracks needs a history entry, but the real question is whether source info changes are actually tracked by the timeline or if they're separate metadata that doesn't need history logging.\n\nLooking at the existing timeline events, source info changes aren't listed, so they're not currently tracked. But I notice CDP-HDR-05 (type change) sits in the same section as the other header changes that do have timeline entries, which creates an inconsistency I should flag. Let me move forward by checking the test entries against the actual implementation.\n\nFor Job 1, I've identified two clear violations: CDP-HDR-05 lacks a timeline entry despite being grouped with other field edits that have them, and none of the four quick action modals have cancel test entries, which violates the directive to completely test modal functionality. Now I'm moving into Job 2.\n\nI need to examine the ClientDetailPage components against the writeApp.md directives. This means checking that test entries match the component code, verifying visual design matches the mockup without simplification, ensuring all interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes, and confirming the monorepo structure follows the specified conventions.\n\nBeyond the component-level checks, I'm also reviewing the broader architectural directives: the Netlify configuration for the subdirectory setup, database handling for null conversions with DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID types, modal entity selection using searchable dropdowns instead of text inputs, navigation consistency to avoid

Let me start systematically checking each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientDetailPage\n\nI need to check the ClientDetailPage test entries (section 2 in docs/tests.md) against the testSpec.md directives.\n\nLet me go through each directive:\n\n### Directive 1: Consistent navigation/styling over exact mockup adherence\nNot directly relevant to individual page test entries. ✓\n\n### Directive 2: Systematically inventory every visible element\nLooking at the component list:\n- ClientHeader: name, type badge, status badge, tags, edit icon - all tested ✓\n\n\n- QuickActions: Add Task, Add Deal, Add Attachment, Add Person - all tested ✓\n- SourceInfoSection: source, campaign, channel, date, Edit button - all tested ✓\n- TasksSection: heading, unresolved label, checkboxes, due dates, deal associations - all tested ✓\n- DealsSection: heading, list with name/stage/value - tested ✓\n- AttachmentsSection: heading, file previews, filename, type, date, deal, actions - tested ✓\n- PeopleSection: heading, avatar, name, role - tested ✓\n- TimelineSection: heading, events - all tested ✓\n\nAll required elements are accounted for. Navigation targets are properly specified across tasks, deals, and individuals. For mutations, I'm verifying that name changes, status updates, and tag modifications persist correctly and generate corresponding timeline entries.\n\nI'm noticing a violation with the type change mutation—it persists but doesn't create a timeline entry. Most other operations like task and deal creation properly log timeline events, though a few like attachment uploads and source info changes don't have timeline entries mentioned. Task completion does generate the expected timeline record. I need to flag the type change issue and continue checking button and control styling requirements. I've identified two key violations: the type change action missing a timeline entry, and no cancel button tests across any of the modals. Now I need to examine the actual component code for Jobs 2 and 3 to see what's implemented.","signature":"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"

Let me also check the backend functions to ensure compliance with the neon SQL tagged template directive and the empty string to null conversion directive. Let me also check if there are any native `<select>` elements.\n\nLet me now systematically check the writeApp.md directives against each component:\n\n### Directive 1: Test entry requirements satisfied by app code\nI need to cross-reference the test entries with the component implementations. Let me check the key ones:\n\n- CDP-HDR-01: Header shows name, type, status, tags. Looking at ClientHeader.tsx - it shows name (h1), type badge, status badge via StatusDropdown, tags via TagBadge. \n\n- CDP-HDR-02: Editing name. ClientHeader has editing mode with name input. ✓\n- CDP-HDR-03: Editing status via StatusDropdown. The StatusDropdown changes status directly via handleStatusChange → onUpdate({ status: newStatus }) — but this is separate from the edit mode which handles all fields. ✓ \n- CDP-HDR-04: Tag editing. Tags are editable in edit mode. ✓\n- CDP-HDR-05: Type editing. Type is editable in edit mode via FilterSelect. ✓\n- CDP-QA-01: Quick action buttons. All 4 buttons present. ✓\n- CDP-QA-02: Add Task modal fields. Looking at AddTaskModal - has title, description, due date, priority, deal association. ✓\n- CDP-QA-04: Add Deal modal fields. AddDealModal has name, value, stage, owner. ✓\n- CDP-QA-06: Add Attachment with file upload. AddAttachmentModal has file upload and link toggle. ✓\n- CDP-QA-08: Add Person modal. AddPersonModal has create new / associate existing. ✓\n- CDP-SRC-01: Source info display. SourceInfoSection shows all fields. ✓\n- CDP-TSK-01: Tasks display. TasksSection shows tasks with checkboxes, titles, due dates, deal links. ✓\n- CDP-DL-01: Deals display. DealsSection shows deals. ✓\n- CDP-ATT-01: Attachments display. AttachmentsSection shows file type preview, filename, type, date, deal, download/delete. ✓\n- CDP-PPL-01: People display. PeopleSection shows avatar, name, role. ✓\n- CDP-TL-01: Timeline display. TimelineSection shows events grouped by date. ✓\n\nNow I'm checking the visual consistency against the mockup and verifying data-testid attributes across the components. Starting with ClientHeader.tsx - I can see it has the container, name input, and save button test IDs in place.\n\nChecking test IDs for the header controls... Continuing through the remaining sections—TasksSection needs test IDs for individual task items with their checkboxes, titles, due dates, and deal links, then DealsSection and AttachmentsSection each need their own container and item-level identifiers. I've finished verifying the test IDs for the timeline section. Now I need to check a few other directives—the monorepo base configuration in netlify.toml can wait, but I should look at the backend functions to confirm they're using the Neon SQL tagged template syntax correctly. I'm also seeing that the null conversion for empty strings is already handled in the page code with the OR operator pattern.\n\nLooking at the modals, they're all using searchable selects for entity associations like deals and owners, which is good. The AddPersonModal also has a search input for existing associations. Everything checks out there.\n\nNow checking for native select elements across all the components—ClientHeader, the modals, and others—and I'm not finding any, they're all using the custom FilterSelect component instead. For attachments, the preview component is properly displaying file-type-specific icons and labels based on the file type. Moving on to verify that attachment uploads are actually functional...\n\nAddAttachmentModal has a file input at line 105, but it's using `URL.createObjectURL` to create temporary blob URLs rather than integrating with UploadThing for persistent storage. The comment acknowledges this is a placeholder for production. The directive requires actual file upload functionality, not just link entry, and while the file picker is there, the implementation doesn't persist files beyond the current session—this is a gap that needs addressing. The blob URL approach means files won't persist after a page refresh, which violates the \"working file upload mechanism\" requirement in the directive—the file data is actually lost, not properly uploaded. I should verify whether the backend is handling the actual file persistence or if this is genuinely a gap in the implementation. I've identified the blob URL issue in AddAttachmentModal as a violation of the UploadThing requirement, so now I need to examine the backend functions that support ClientDetailPage to check for neon

[2026-02-20T06:44:16.489Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01QyyxkRoMzLfgDhfaaq51mb","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me check the backend code for writeApp.md directive violations:\n\n### Directive 5: Neon SQL tagged template syntax\nAll the backend functions use `sql\\`...\\`` tagged template literal syntax. ✓ No instances of `sql(queryString, paramsArray)` found.\n\n### Directive 6: Empty strings to null conversion\n- `client-tasks.ts`: `${body.due_date || null}` ✓, `${body.deal_id || null}` ✓\n- `client-deals.ts`: `${body.expected_close_date || null}` ✓\n\n\n- `client-attachments.ts`: `${body.deal_id || null}` ✓\n- `client-people.ts`: Uses `??` for string fields like name, title, email, and phone, which is fine since they're not DATE/UUID types. ✓\n- `clients.ts`: `${body.date_acquired || null}` ✓ for the date field, and the PUT handler uses `COALESCE` with `??` for text fields like source_type. ✓\n\nBut I'm noticing the PUT handler doesn't actually update `date_acquired` at all — it only modifies `campaign`, `channel`, `source_detail`, and `source_type`. Let me verify this is intentional or if it's missing from the update query. I see the SourceInfoSection is passing `date_acquired` in the update payload, but the backend's UPDATE query doesn't include it — that's a real bug that violates directive 1 since the test cases require editing and persisting the date acquired field. Looking at directive 6 more carefully, the `??` operator for string fields doesn't matter since that directive only applies to DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types anyway. The frontend correctly converts empty strings to null using `|| null` for all source fields including `date_acquired`, and the backend's `??` operator works fine since it receives null values. However, I'm noticing that `date_acquired` isn't actually being updated in the backend PUT handler at all—that's the real issue here.\n\nNow I'm checking how the path parameters are being extracted across the Netlify functions. Each function parses the URL path by splitting and filtering, then grabs the ID from index 3 of the resulting array, which correctly corresponds to the dynamic segment in routes like `/.netlify/functions/client-tasks/:taskId`.\n\nI'm also verifying the modal implementations follow the requirements — the task, deal, and attachment modals all use searchable FilterSelect components for entity associations, and the person modal has API-backed search. I don't see any native `<select>` elements anywhere in the codebase, which is correct.\n\nNow I'm checking the attachment handling more carefully. The AddAttachmentModal is using `URL.createObjectURL()` to create temporary blob URLs, but this doesn't actually persist the files anywhere — it violates the directive to use UploadThing for file storage with the provided token.\n\nLooking at the clients.ts PUT handler, I notice it's creating timeline events when the status changes, but it's not doing the same for name or tag changes, which seems like an incomplete implementation.\n\nThe test spec actually requires timeline entries for name changes (CDP-HDR-02) and tag changes (CDP-HDR-04), so the backend isn't satisfying those requirements. That's a violation of the directive to ensure app code meets all test entry requirements.\n\nI'm also noticing the SourceInfoSection is sending `date_acquired` in its update payload, but the PUT handler doesn't actually include that field in the UPDATE query, which means those edits aren't being saved to the database.\n\nAnd the file upload in AddAttachmentModal is using temporary blob URLs instead of actually uploading files through UploadThing, so attachments aren't persisting to storage.\n\nLet me double-check the name and tag change logic to make sure I have the violations right.\n\nLooking at what the backend actually handles, it's creating timeline events for task creation, completion, deal creation, attachments, contacts, and status changes—but it's missing entries for name, tag, and type changes. The test requirements CDP-HDR-02 and CDP-HDR-03 explicitly expect timeline entries when these fields change, so that's a clear gap between what the tests require and what the code

Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n2. For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n3. Avoid using getByText() with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements. Prefer getByTestId for precise element targeting, or use getByRole/getByLabel with exact matching. Never work around strict mode violations with .first().\n\n\n4. All data-testid values must be consistent across test files for the same component — I need to check existing spec files before writing cross-cutting tests to ensure I'm using the same testid values.\n5. File upload tests must exercise actual file upload mechanics with Playwright's setInputFiles rather than substituting URL or text input tests.\n6. Never nest Playwright locator calls with auto-wait inside .toPass() retry blocks — use single atomic assertions with built-in retry instead.\n7. Strategy files are located at /repo/strategies.\n8. Apps with login/signup functionality need a complete e2e test covering the full sign-up and sign-in flow.\n\nFor parallel test design, I need to ensure tests that create, modify, or delete records don't rely on fixed record counts, never hardcode database IDs, and the Playwright config must have fullyParallel: true without setting workers: 1.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking the test file against these directives, starting with verifying that navigation targets use precise URL patterns like regex checks.\n\nLooking at the navigation assertions, I see they're correctly using regex or exact ID matching for the URLs. But when I examine the side effects directive, I notice a significant gap: none of the tests actually verify that timeline entries are created after mutations. The CDP-HDR-02 test only confirms the name change persists after reload, but doesn't check for a corresponding timeline entry. Similarly, there are no tests verifying timeline entries when creating tasks or deals.\n\nNow I'm realizing the test IDs in the file don't align with the spec entries—the numbering is off. I need to map them more carefully to see which spec requirements are actually being tested and which are missing timeline verification. Looking at the test coverage gaps, I'm noticing that the actual tests are misaligned with the spec requirements—the status, tag, and type editing tests are either missing entirely or testing the wrong functionality. The QuickActions section shows similar patterns where test naming doesn't match spec intent. The tests are only checking that modals open, not whether the actual creation and persistence logic works. Looking at the side effects directive, I notice that several tests claim to verify timeline entries—like CDP-HDR-02, CDP-QA-03, CDP-QA-05, and CDP-QA-09—but the actual test code doesn't assert on those entries at all. Now I'm checking the getByText() calls to see if they're specific enough within their modal scope. tests only verify modal structure, not actual file upload functionality. There's a gap here — the spec requires testing file upload with Playwright's setInputFiles method, but that's not implemented. The remaining directives around auto-wait calls, auth tests, and parallel design patterns all check out.\n\nNow I'm comparing test titles against the spec entries to see if they match. The header tests have misaligned titles — the first one claims to test tags but the actual test doesn't verify them, and a couple of tests don't have corresponding spec entries at all. I need to trace through what the spec actually requires versus what's being tested.\n\nLooking at the Quick Actions tests, there's a numbering mismatch too — the test IDs don't line up with the spec IDs, so CDP-QA-03 in tests maps to CDP-QA-04 in the spec, and it keeps shifting from there.\n\nNow checking the Tasks and Deals sections, I'm seeing similar partial alignment issues. The CDP-TSK-01 test verifies the section is visible but doesn't confirm it displays unresolved tasks specifically, and while some tests like CDP-TSK-03 match their spec counterparts, others are testing behaviors that aren't clearly documented in the spec.\n\nLooking at what's missing, there's no test coverage for task completion via checkbox or deal associations, and the Attachments section is only partially tested—download and view link functionality aren't being validated. The Timeline tests appear more complete with basic visibility covered.\n\nThe bigger picture is that Job 3 has significant gaps across multiple spec entries: status, tag, and type edits aren't being tested for persistence or timeline updates, task and deal persistence with timeline effects are missing, attachment uploads lack coverage, person persistence isn't validated, and source info saves aren't being verified. The Timeline tests themselves are incomplete, missing coverage for specific event types and atomicity checks.\n\nBeyond the missing tests, there's a pattern issue—none of the existing tests actually verify side effects like timeline entries appearing after mutations, and the file upload directive isn't being tested at all. The test titles also don't align with the spec entry names, which creates confusion about what's actually being covered.\n\nNow I need to consolidate what I've found across all three jobs and organize these violations into fix groups based on their root causes, rather than trying to patch everything individually. I'm reconsidering how to group these violations more strategically. The timeline entry issues across specs and backend are clearly related—they stem from the same incomplete tracking system. The `date_acquired` update is a separate backend fix. File upload needs UploadThing integration. And the test gaps form their own category around coverage and assertion quality. Let me organize these into actionable fix groups that can be tackled independently. I'm narrowing down the fix groups to focus on the most critical violations: one for backend timeline entries and the test spec, another for the missing date_acquired update, and a third for the incomplete test implementations in ClientDetailPage. I'm organizing these fixes into four distinct groups based on their root causes and dependencies. The first group handles timeline and backend persistence issues together since they stem from missing update logic in the backend. The second focuses on the file upload mechanism, which is a separate concern. The third addresses the test coverage gaps across multiple areas. And the fourth handles the specific test spec entries for modal
