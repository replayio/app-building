This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   185→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   186→\n   187→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   188→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   189→\n   190→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   191→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   192→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   193→\n   194→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   195→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   196→\n   197→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   198→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   199→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   200→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   201→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   202→\n   203→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   204→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   205→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   206→\n   207→## Tips\n   208→\n   209→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   210→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   211→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   212→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   213→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   214→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   215→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   216→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   217→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   218→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   219→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   220→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   221→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   222→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   223→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   224→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   225→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   226→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   227→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   228→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   229→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   230→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   231→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   232→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   233→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   234→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   235→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   236→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   237→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   238→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   239→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   240→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   241→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   242→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   243→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   244→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   245→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   246→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   247→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   248→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   249→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   250→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01M8ACrFRQAApaXAdnuKHgK2","session_id":"b4eb3b0a-568d-4f7a-bbc0-236fe4c4bb2c","uuid":"0a9f78b5-253f-401b-ba4b-137ec33621bd"}

Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.

If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.

Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    80→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    81→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01M8ACrFRQAApaXAdnuKHgK2","session_id":"b4eb3b0a-568d-4f7a-bbc0-236fe4c4bb2c","uuid":"9030287b-3149-4f64-a631-6b42e9ce2a41"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.

Look for a\n   211→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   212→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   213→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   214→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   215→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   216→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   217→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   218→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   219→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   220→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   221→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   222→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   223→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   224→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   225→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   226→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   227→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   228→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   229→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context.

If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   240→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   241→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   242→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   243→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser).
