Let me follow the steps:\n\n1. The bug is about a netlify.toml configuration issue - a catch-all SPA redirect was intercepting Vite dev server module requests, preventing React from mounting.\n\n2. Is this a problem with the app's style or UI? No, this is a configuration issue with netlify.toml.\n\n3. This is a functional problem - actually, it's more of an infrastructure/configuration issue. The netlify.toml file had a catch-all redirect that broke Vite dev server. This prevented the entire app from mounting.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The bug is that the `netlify.toml` configuration had a catch-all redirect that broke Vite dev server. \n\nThis is a build and deployment configuration issue, not a styling or functional app problem. I should check what the test entries looked like at the point before the fix to properly classify this.\n\nThe real issue is that the app fails to mount entirely because of how netlify.toml's catch-all redirect interferes with Vite's dev server requests. The fix involved adding passthrough rules for those specific paths, which is fundamentally a configuration concern that belongs in the app-writing stage rather than being a test failure caused by incorrect behavior. The writeApp.md stage is about writing the app's code.\n\nWait, actually let me reconsider. The bug is not really about styling/UI. It's about configuration. Let me look at the stages more carefully:\n\n- writeApp.md is for writing the app's code and has guidelines for writing the app\n- The netlify.toml redirect rules are part of the app's configuration\n\nThis is more of a deployment/configuration issue than a test specification issue. The netlify.toml file is part of the app setup. The writeApp.md stage seems most appropriate since that's where the netlify.toml would be written.\n\nActually, let me re-read the classification steps more carefully:\n\nStep 2: \"Determine whether the bug is a problem with the app's style or UI.\" - No, this is not a style/UI bug.\n\nStep 3: \"Otherwise the bug is a functional problem.\"\n\nHere is the next thinking you need to rewrite:\n - Let me check tests.md at the old revision.\n\nStep 4: \"If the old test entries specify the buggy behavior\" - unlikely since this is a configuration issue.\n\nStep 5: \"If the old test entries specify the correct behavior\" - the tests presumably test sidebar navigation, which should work.\n\nStep 6: \"Otherwise the test entries say nothing about this behavior\" - the tests probably say nothing specifically about netlify.toml configuration.\n\nActually, this bug is interesting because it's not about specific app functionality - it's about the app failing to mount at all due to a configuration issue. Let me check what the tests looked like before the fix.\n\nLet me also check the git diff to see what was changed to fix the bug.\n\nI need to look at the old tests.md to understand what was being tested, then examine the git diff to see what configuration changes fixed the mounting issue.","signature":"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

Let me go through the classification steps:\n\n1. **Read the bug report** - Done. The bug is about netlify.toml's catch-all SPA redirect intercepting Vite dev server module requests, preventing React from mounting.\n\n2. **Is this a styling/UI bug?** - No. This is a configuration issue with netlify.toml that prevents the entire app from loading.\n\n3. **It's a functional problem** - Actually, this is a configuration/infrastructure issue. The app literally doesn't mount because of a netlify.toml configuration problem. Let me check the test entries at the old revision (8bbb1fd).\n   \nLooking at the test entries, they describe sidebar navigation working correctly across pages, but they don't address the underlying configuration issue preventing the app from mounting in the first place. The tests specify correct behavior, but they're silent on this particular netlify.toml problem.\n\nThe real issue here is about app infrastructure and deployment configuration, not a feature behavior that test specs would capture. Since the fix involved updating netlify.toml to add passthrough redirects for Vite dev paths, this falls under how the app was written and configured—which belongs in the writeApp.md stage. The issue is with the netlify.toml configuration—specifically the catch-all SPA redirect conflicting with the Vite dev server. This is a setup/configuration problem that belongs in writeApp.md, not a test specification issue, since the tests themselves are correctly written and the problem isn't about underspecified test entries but rather how the app was misconfigured. The tests actually do cover sidebar functionality and would catch this bug—they fail when the sidebar doesn't render. The real issue isn't test coverage but the app configuration itself being broken, so Step 5 doesn't quite fit here since the problem isn't underspecified tests but a broken netlify.toml setup. they DO fail when the sidebar doesn't render (which is exactly what happened). So the tests ARE covering this behavior correctly. The bug is in the app's configuration (netlify.toml), not in the tests.\n\nSo the test entries specify the correct behavior (step 5 applies partially), and the tests are trying to cover it (they test sidebar rendering). But the root cause is a netlify.toml configuration issue.\n\nActually, I think the most accurate classification is that the test entries specify the correct behavior (the sidebar should render and be navigable), and the tests DO cover it (they test sidebar rendering and fail when it doesn't work). The bug was simply in the app code (specifically the netlify.toml configuration). This means the test system worked correctly - it caught the bug. The problem was in writing the app.\n\nI'm overcomplicating this. The classification steps are really about which stage of the development process needs better guidelines. The bug was in how the app was configured—specifically the netlify.toml file—so the issue falls under the writeApp.md guidelines, not the test specifications or test writing. The tests actually did their job by catching the misconfiguration. The tests actually do catch the bug and specify the correct behavior, so this isn't a test coverage problem—the real issue is a netlify.toml configuration problem that's preventing the app from working correctly in production. So the real issue is that this bug doesn't fit neatly into any problem stage—the tests worked correctly by catching the failure, and the fix was in app configuration rather than test coverage or UI styling. Since netlify.toml is part of the app's setup rather than a styling issue, writeApp.md seems like the closest fit, even though it's not a perfect match for what that stage typically covers. The tests correctly catch the bug when the sidebar fails to mount, and the test entries specify the right behavior, so step 5 applies—but the reasoning doesn't fit since the tests ARE working properly. The real issue is that the bug lives in the app's configuration layer during setup, not in the test coverage itself. tests must not be covering the entries properly (otherwise the tests would have caught the bug before it was deployed/used).\n\nBut in this case, the tests DO catch the bug. The bug was caught by the tests failing. So the test coverage was fine.\n\nHmm, but this is the \"before fix\" state. At revision 8bbb1fd, the tests were failing because the app didn't mount. So the tests were indeed catching the bug. This means the tests were working correctly, and the bug was introduced in the app code.\n\nI think the correct classification is: **no problem stage**. The reason is:\n- The test entries correctly describe the expected behavior\n- The tests correctly test and catch the bug\n- The bug is in the app's configuration, which was caught by the existing test infrastructure\n- There's no deficiency in any of the build stages (testSpec, writeApp, writeTests) - the bug was simply a configuration error that the tests properly caught.\n\nActually, I'm second-guessing myself here. The real question is which stage should be improved to prevent this kind of bug in the future. Even though the tests caught it, the bug shouldn't have made it into the app code in the first place. The netlify.toml configuration should have been correct when the app was initially written. So maybe the issue is with the writeApp stage—the developer should have been more careful about configuration setup, or there should be better guidance on what configurations are needed.\n\nBut the classification system seems to be asking: given that a bug exists, which stage of the process failed to prevent or catch it? In this case, the tests caught it, so the testing stage worked. The bug exists in the app code, so the writeApp stage failed to prevent it. But the classification for writeApp is specifically about styling and UI behavior that tests can't catch. Configuration issues CAN be caught by tests.\n\nSo I'm back to thinking this might be \"no problem stage\" or perhaps the classification system doesn't have a good category for this type of bug. path (steps 3-6):\n- Test entries specify correct behavior (sidebar should work)\n- The tests catch the bug\n\nThe fact that tests catch it means the test system is working. The bug was introduced during app writing, but the test process caught it.\n\nI believe the correct classification is: **the tests worked correctly, the bug was in the app code, and there's no problem with any specific stage's guidelines.** The writeApp stage created a bug, but the testing stage caught it. This is the normal flow.\n\nBut... the strategy says to identify \"any problem stage whose instructions need improvements to prevent similar bugs.\" The goal is PREVENTION. Even though tests caught it, ideally the app should be written correctly in the first place.\n\nSo should writeApp.md be improved to prevent this? The bug is a netlify.toml configuration issue. writeApp.md could include guidance about netlify.toml configuration. But the classification steps only map writeApp.md to styling/UI bugs, not configuration issues.\n\nI'm going in circles here. The tests ARE catching the bug properly—they fail as expected. But step 5 claims the problem is with writeTests.md because \"tests aren't covering it properly,\" which contradicts the fact that they're catching it. Let me reconsider what's actually happening: the app fails to mount entirely due to the netlify.toml issue, and the tests catch this failure. Maybe the real issue is that the app shouldn't have been written with this configuration problem in the first place. I'm settling on writeApp.md as the problem stage since that's where netlify.toml gets created, and better guidelines around configuration setup could have caught this. The bug itself was a configuration error, and while the classification system doesn't perfectly map infrastructure issues, the practical fix belongs in that stage where the file is authored. I'm realizing the tests actually did catch the bug—they failed when the sidebar didn't render. The bug was introduced in the app code and the testing phase caught it as designed, so there's no gap in test coverage here. This is normal operation: code was written with a bug, tests flagged it, and it got fixed. The tests do catch the bug, so the infrastructure issue is being validated by the test system even though the tests themselves aren't specifically about netlify.toml configuration. I'm going to classify this as a problem stage of writeTests.md since the test entries describe the correct behavior that the bug violates, and the tests successfully identified the failure—the testing process worked as intended. the netlify.toml misconfiguration). So writeApp.md is the right classification — the bug should have been prevented by better guidelines for how to configure the app, not by improving tests.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The tests caught the bug correctly, which means the test infrastructure worked as intended. The problem was in the app configuration itself. Given the classification framework, this feels like it should be **no problem stage** since the tests did their job and the issue was purely in how the app was configured.\n\nNow I need to check if AppRevisions.md needs updating. The fix involved adding a passthrough redirect configuration, so I should verify that section was documented

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":133,"startLine":1,"totalLines":133}}}

Let me follow the classification steps:\n\n1. **Read the bug report** - Done. The bug is about netlify.toml's catch-all SPA redirect intercepting Vite dev server module requests.\n\n2. **Is it a styling/UI bug?** - No. This is a netlify.toml configuration issue.\n\n3. **It's a functional problem.** Check the test entries at the before-fix revision (8bbb1fd).\n\n4. **Do the old test entries specify the buggy behavior?** - No. The test entries specify correct sidebar behavior (sidebar should render and be navigable).\n   \nThe tests actually do cover the correct behavior and fail when the sidebar doesn't render, so the issue is purely a configuration problem in netlify.toml rather than a test coverage gap. The classification framework suggests this would be a writeTests.md problem, but that doesn't apply here since the tests are already adequate. are \"covering it properly.\" The tests test sidebar rendering, but the root cause is a netlify.toml configuration issue that prevents the ENTIRE app from mounting. \n\nActually, looking at this more carefully - the tests DO fail, which means they ARE covering the behavior. The bug is in the app's infrastructure. The fact that the tests caught it means the test system is working correctly.\n\nBut strictly following the classification:\n- Step 5: \"If the old test entries specify the correct behavior\" → Yes they do\n- \"the tests aren't covering it properly\" → Actually, they are covering it. The tests fail when the sidebar doesn't render.\n\nHmm, I think the issue is whether the tests are \"covering it properly\" means:\na) The tests catch the bug when it exists (they do), or\nb) The tests prevented the bug from shipping (this depends on the process)\n\nThe tests DO catch the bug. They fail, so the tests are working. The problem is in the app code. Since the bug lives in infrastructure configuration rather than fitting the defined problem stages, and the tests are actually doing their job by catching the failure, I think this is a case where there's no problem stage that applies. The dev server configuration issue doesn't warrant changes to AppRevisions.md since the fix addresses infrastructure rather than app behavior. I'm classifying this as a \"No problem stage\" bug—the configuration error prevented the app from mounting entirely, but the tests correctly identified the failure, so there's no gap in test specifications, UI guidelines, or test writing practices. Now I'll update bugReports.md with this classification and move forward.","signature":"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

The tests also correctly catch the failure (they fail when the sidebar doesn't render because the app can't mount).\n\nHowever, the step 5 conclusion — \"the tests aren't covering it properly → writeTests.md\" — doesn't match. The tests DO cover this correctly; they fail when the app doesn't mount. The problem is purely in app infrastructure configuration (netlify.toml), and the test system caught it as designed.\n\nSince the strategy notes \"Some bugs do not have problem stages,\" and this is a configuration error that was correctly caught by existing tests, I'll classify this as **no problem stage**.\n\nAlso, the fix doesn't change app behavior — it fixes dev server configuration. AppRevisions.md (which doesn't exist) doesn't need to be created.\n\nLet me update bugReports.md with the classification."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11475,"cache_read_input_tokens":34712,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11475,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0da9dea9-c115-4d56-8508-0ad7f1969fcf","uuid":"92801807-b998-48d3-9be9-08936748435b"}
