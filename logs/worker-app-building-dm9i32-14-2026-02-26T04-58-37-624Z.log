You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

{\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr;  /* 1 column on mobile */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Media Queries Found\n\nThe app currently has media queries in:\n\n1. **SuppliersList.css**: Responsive grid (4 → 3 → 2 → 1 columns)\n2. **SupplierOverview.css**: Button wrapping on tablets (max-width: 768px)\n3. **OrderSummary.css**: Grid layout changes (3 → 2 → 1 columns)\n4. **index.css**: Page content padding (max-width: 640px)\n\nAs noted in `/repo/apps/SupplierTracker/docs/plan.md`, the responsive UI for all three pages remains incomplete and is marked as a polish task to be completed."}],"totalDurationMs":58587,"totalTokens":71528,"totalToolUseCount":21,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5189,"cache_read_input_tokens":57264,"output_tokens":9073,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5189},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me plan and implement the responsive changes for each page.\n\n## DashboardPage Responsive Changes\n\nThe DashboardPage already has `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. Components:\n\n### QuickActions\n- `.quick-actions-buttons` is flex with gap-16 - needs to stack on small screens\n- `.quick-action-btn` has white-space: nowrap - needs flex-wrap or stacking\n- Line items row in modal (`.line-item-row`) has 5 columns - needs to adapt\n- Modal `.form-row` needs to stack on small screens\n\n\n- UpcomingOrdersTable has 5 columns that need to collapse on narrow viewports, with secondary columns hidden and a card mode at 480px\n- SuppliersList already has a responsive grid that scales from 4 down to 1 column, so that's good as-is\n\nI'll start by updating the CSS for QuickActions to handle stacking, simplify the line item grid on mobile, and make form rows stack on small screens. Writing responsive styles... I need to clarify the approach here—since the table header columns are explicit but the table body rows are mapped from data, I should apply Tailwind classes directly to the `<th>` and `<td>` elements for the responsive hiding rather than relying on CSS media queries.\n\nFor the visibility strategy, I'm thinking Expected Delivery should hide at `max-lg` and Total Cost at `max-md`, keeping Order ID and Status visible at all breakpoints since those are the most critical details.\n\nNow I'm working through the CSS updates—adding card mode styling at 480px to hide the table header and switch rows to flex layout, plus making the quick action buttons stack vertically on smaller screens and simplifying the line-item display.\n\nAdding responsive CSS rules... Writing responsive styles... Now I need to handle the card layout mode that kicks in at 480px—I'll hide the table header and restructure each row to display as flex with wrapped content, then use `::before` pseudo-elements to label each cell with its field name. Still writing responsive styles... Still writing responsive styles... Writing responsive classes... Adding responsive styles for smaller screens... Still writing responsive styles... Still writing responsive styles...\n\nNow I'm moving on to implement the SupplierDetailsPage changes, starting with the CSS updates for SupplierOverview and then handling the responsive layout adjustments for detail fields on smaller screens. I should finish the OrderDocuments section and then start implementing these changes systematically across all three pages. Before I dive in, I need to verify that Tailwind's `max-*` variants are actually configured in the project since the existing code already uses

The `max-sm:p-3` classes used in the TSX files may just be class names that happen to look like Tailwind but are actually defined in the CSS. Let me check if there are any CSS rules that define `max-sm:p-3`.\n\nLooking at the index.css:\n```css\n.p-6 {\n  padding: 24px;\n}\n\n@media (max-width: 640px) {\n  .max-sm\\:p-3 {\n    padding: 12px;\n  }\n\n\n}\n```\n\nSo these are manually defined CSS classes mimicking Tailwind's naming convention, which means I can't use actual Tailwind utilities. Instead, I'll need to create custom CSS classes with media queries to handle the responsive column hiding, or use CSS selectors like nth-child to target specific table cells. but since Tailwind isn't actually installed, I need to define these CSS classes manually in the CSS files.\n\nOK wait, looking at the index.css again:\n```css\n.p-6 {\n  padding: 24px;\n}\n\n@media (max-width: 640px) {\n  .max-sm\\:p-3 {\n    padding: 12px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe page content div has `className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\"`. These are custom CSS classes that are defined in index.css. They mimic Tailwind but aren't actually Tailwind.\n\nSo for my responsive work, I have two options:\n1. Define custom CSS classes that mimic Tailwind naming in index.css\n2. Use CSS media queries with selectors\n\nThe skill says to use Tailwind responsive utility classes as the primary tool, but since Tailwind isn't installed, I need to work with what's available. I'll define CSS classes in index.css to serve the same purpose, or use more direct CSS selectors. For column hiding specifically, I can use nth-child selectors within media queries or add specific class names to the table cells. I'll go with a pragmatic approach using CSS classes and media queries to handle responsive behavior. Writing responsive table styles...\n\nNow I'm thinking through the card layout at smaller breakpoints—I need to decide which columns are essential to show when the table switches to card mode on mobile. Order ID and Status are definitely key, and I should probably include Supplier too, while Expected Delivery and Total Cost can stay hidden to keep the cards compact. I'm working through which columns to prioritize for the card layout at 480px. The hiding rules cascade naturally—columns hidden at larger breakpoints stay hidden at smaller ones—so I just need to decide what's essential to show. Order ID and Status are must-haves, while Expected Delivery is the least critical, so I'll hide that at 1024px and Total Cost at 768px, leaving Order ID, Supplier, and Status visible in the card view.\n\nNow I'm adding the CSS media queries to handle the responsive adjustments...\n\nI'm verifying the padding changes align with the design system—reducing from 16px/20px down to 12px at smaller breakpoints matches the spacing scale.

But the shared files are trying to import from `react`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, etc., which should be available from SupplierTracker's node_modules. The issue might be that tsc resolves types relative to the file location. Since shared is at `../shared/`, tsc looks for node_modules relative to that directory.\n\nLet me check if there's a `skipLibCheck` - yes there is, but it only applies to `.d.ts` files, not to source files.\n \nWith `moduleResolution: \"bundler\"`, tsc uses Vite-like resolution that looks for the nearest `node_modules`, so since `../shared/` doesn't have its own, it can't find those dependencies. This is a pre-existing configuration issue unrelated to my CSS changes. Let me verify by checking if the SupplierTracker source files themselves have any errors.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":406,"cache_read_input_tokens":112933,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":406,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d3693aa9-0956-4a31-adf6-d4a65fca6b8e","uuid":"70f30f23-1534-4d53-b1a9-5ffc14a12f69"}
