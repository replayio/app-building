This is the single entry point for running\ntests during development and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n   previous runs.\n\n2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n\n3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n\n4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n   test data.\n\n5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n   prior runs.\n\n6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n   `DATABASE_URL`. Pipe all Playwright output to a log file (see Outputs).\n\n7. **Parse results**: Count passed/failed/skipped tests from the Playwright JSON reporter output\n   at `test-results/results.json`.\n\n8. **On failure** (non-zero exit code):\n   a. Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n   b. Append full metadata for every recording that has test metadata to the log file in a\n      delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, append `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` to the\n      log file. On failure, log the exit code.\n\n9. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n10. **Print summary** to stdout: a single line like `10 passed` or\n    `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`. Include the uploaded recording ID\n    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n\n11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: One-line summary only. Never verbose test output.\n- **`logs/test-run-N.log`**: Full Playwright output, recording metadata, and upload results.\n  `N` increments each run (find the highest existing number and add 1).\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON. The\n  `addMetadata` entries contain `metadata.test.result` which indicates pass/fail.\n- The Playwright config must use the Replay browser via `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n  from `@replayio/playwright` and include `replayReporter` with `upload: false`.\n- The HTML reporter must use `open: 'never'` to suppress the interactive \"Serving HTML report\"\n  prompt that blocks the script from exiting.\n- Run Playwright with `--retries 0` — no retries. Failures must be analyzed via Replay.\n- Do NOT inherit stdio from Playwright. Pipe stdout and stderr to the log file using\n  `child_process.execSync` with `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` or similar, then write\n  the captured output to the log file.\n- Use the JSON reporter (`test-results/results.json`) to parse pass/fail counts for the\n  summary line.\n- The `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` env var is already set in the container.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

The subtask \"Unpack: Implement package scripts\" means I need to look at the design docs and create tasks for implementing the scripts that don't exist yet. Let me check what scripts need to be implemented:\n\n1. `check.ts` - Already exists and has a package.json entry ✓\n2. `deploy.ts` - Not yet created, design doc exists at `skills/scripts/deploy.md`\n3. `test.ts` - Not yet created, design doc exists at `skills/scripts/test.md`\n4. `netlify-env.md` - Reference doc, not a script to implement\n\n\n5. `deploy-verification.md` - Reference doc, not a script to implement\n\nI also notice the `test.md` design doc references `seed-db.ts`, so I need to check if that exists. But wait—I'm realizing \"Unpack\" means I should break this into subtasks and add them to the queue rather than implementing the scripts myself. I need to use `add-task` to insert these as separate items at the front of the queue, then signal completion.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2101,"cache_read_input_tokens":34121,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2101,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f5c93825-f623-45a1-9a16-62e58910fa58","uuid":"4859b03b-b591-4b5e-8628-c4cb157ca1f0"}
