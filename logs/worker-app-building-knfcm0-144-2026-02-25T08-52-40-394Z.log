Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ea0d70e7-d981-4aa5-8c55-c72e891cb543","uuid":"a162df24-fc67-4a07-9a55-7321c67dd88e","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\n     4→web apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n     5→\n     6→Key directories:\n     7→\n     8→* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n     9→* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n    10→* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n    24→3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    25→   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    26→\n    27→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    28→matching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    29→\n    30→## Worker Execution\n    31→\n    32→The worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    39→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    40→\n    41→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    42→\n    43→## Task System\n    44→\n    45→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    67→\n    68→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n    69→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    98→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    99→\n   100→## Database\n   101→\n   102→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   103→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   104→frontend components.\n   105→\n   106→## Quality Gates\n   107→\n   108→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   109→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   110→\n   111→## Commits\n   112→\n   113→The worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\n   114→explicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n   115→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_015RqqmZctNDbmVnqmeFazVU","session_id":"ea0d70e7-d981-4aa5-8c55-c72e891cb543","uuid":"2db7e63b-8f71-4e02-872e-7943eb7e1cc2"}

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_015RqqmZctNDbmVnqmeFazVU","session_id":"ea0d70e7-d981-4aa5-8c55-c72e891cb543","uuid":"d1126526-07fa-475b-854a-16a59079cc19"}

Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_015RqqmZctNDbmVnqmeFazVU","session_id":"ea0d70e7-d981-4aa5-8c55-c72e891cb543","uuid":"dda51e87-f99f-4790-8d72-1a546ec6cd85"}

Here's the full picture of the app structure and authentication implementation:\n\n---\n\n## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE\n\n**Apps in `/repo/apps/`:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/` - Primary app (most complete, has full auth)\n- `/repo/apps/Accounting/` - Accounting platform\n- `/repo/apps/SupplierTracker/` - Supplier tracking\n- `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/` - Inventory management\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/` - Production planning\n- `/repo/apps/shared/` - Shared utilities, components, and styles\n\n---\n\n## DESIGN SYSTEM (AppStyle.md)\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Primary accent: `#4d7c5e` (forest green)\n- Light variant: `#5a8f6a`\n- Dark variant: `#3e694e`\n- Muted variant: `#6b8f7a`\n- Subtle bg: `#e6ede8`\n\n**Sidebar:** `#f0eeea` (light gray-brown)\n**Main bg:** `#faf9f7` (off-white)\n**Borders:** `#ddd9d3` (warm gray)\n\n**Typography:** Inter Variable font, 13px base\n**Button height:** 28px\n**Border radius:** 4px (controls), 6px (cards), 8px (modals)\n\n**Status Colors:**\n- Success: `#4d7c5e` (forest green)\n- Warning: `#b08a3e` (amber)\n- Error: `#b05050` (brick red)\n- Info: `#5a7a8a` (slate)\n\n---\n\n## AUTHENTICATION ARCHITECTURE\n\n### Database Schema (PostgreSQL via Neon)\n\n**users table:**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\n  avatar_url TEXT,\n  email_confirmed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n)\n```\n\n**email_tokens table:**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE email_tokens (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  token TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('confirmation', 'reset')),\n  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,\n  used_at TIMESTAMPTZ,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM\n\n### Frontend Redux State\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/shared/auth/authSlice.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport interface AuthUser {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  avatarUrl?: string;\n}\n\nexport interface AuthState {\n  user: AuthUser | null;\n  isAuthenticated: boolean;\n  isLoading: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n**Actions:** `setUser()`, `clearUser()`, `setLoading()`\n\n### Auth Hook\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/shared/auth/useAuth.ts`\n\nReturns: `{ user, isAuthenticated, isLoading, login(), logout(), setAuthLoading() }`\n\n### Backend Auth Middleware\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/shared/backend/auth-middleware.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport function withAuth(handler: HandlerFn, options?: { required?: boolean })\n```\n\n- Extracts JWT from Authorization Bearer token\n- Decodes payload without signature verification\n- Optional mode allows unauthenticated requests (user = null)\n- Required mode returns 401 if no token\n\n---\n\n## AUTHENTICATION UI COMPONENTS\n\n### SidebarAuth Component\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/SidebarAuth.tsx`\n\n**Features:**\n- Sign In button when unauthenticated\n- Inline auth form with email/password fields\n- Toggle between Sign In / Sign Up modes\n- \"Forgot password?\" link navigates to `/auth/forgot-password`\n- Shows user avatar/initials, name, and sign-out button when authenticated\n- Submits to `/.netlify/functions/auth` endpoint\n\n**States:**\n- Not authenticated: Shows \"Sign In\" button\n- Form visible: Shows email, password, error messages, success messages\n- Authenticated: Shows avatar, name, sign-out button\n\n### Auth Pages (Stubbed)\n\nAll in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/`:\n\n1. **ForgotPasswordPage.tsx** - `/auth/forgot-password`\n   - Currently: Empty placeholder with heading\n   - Should: Email input, send reset link via Resend API\n\n2. **ResetPasswordPage.tsx** - `/auth/reset-password?token=...`\n   - Currently: Empty placeholder with heading\n   - Should: New password form, verify token, update password\n\n3. **ConfirmEmailPage.tsx** - `/auth/confirm-email?token=...`\n   - Currently: Empty placeholder with heading\n   - Should: Verify token, mark email_confirmed, log user in\n\n---\n\n## NETLIFY FUNCTION: AUTH ENDPOINT\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/auth.ts`\n\n**POST /.netlify/functions/auth**\n\n```typescript\n{\n  action: \"signin\" | \"signup\",\n  email: string,\n  password: string\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```typescript\n{\n  user: { id, name, email, avatarUrl },\n  token: string,\n  requiresConfirmation?: boolean\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Password hashing: SHA-256 with salt \"sales-crm-salt\"\n- JWT creation: `createJwt()` creates unsigned token (alg: \"none\")\n- Signup: Creates user, generates email_tokens entry, sends confirmation (unless IS_TEST=true)\n- Signin: Verifies password hash, checks email_confirmed, returns token\n- Token stored in localStorage as \"auth_token\"\n\n---\n\n## APP INITIALIZATION FLOW\n\n### Store Setup\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  reducer: {\n    auth: authReducer,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Shared:** `/repo/apps/shared/store/store.ts` - `createAppStore()` uses Redux Toolkit's `configureStore()`\n\n### App.tsx Routing\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`\n\n```typescript\n<Routes>\n  <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navigate to=\"/clients\" replace />} />\n  <Route path=\"/clients\" element={<ClientsListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/clients/:clientId\" element={<ClientDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/contacts\" element={<ContactsListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/individuals/:individualId\" element={<PersonDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/deals\" element={<DealsListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/deals/:dealId\" element={<DealDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/tasks\" element={<TasksListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/tasks/:taskId\" element={<TaskDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/users\" element={<UsersListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/users/:userId\" element={<UserDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/settings\" element={<SettingsPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/auth/forgot-password\" element={<ForgotPasswordPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/auth/reset-password\" element={<ResetPasswordPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/auth/confirm-email\" element={<ConfirmEmailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"*\" element={<Navigate to=\"/\" replace />} />\n</Routes>\n```\n\n### Main Entry\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx`\n\n```typescript\n<Provider store={store}>\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    <App />\n  </BrowserRouter>\n</Provider>\n```\n\n---\n\n## NAVIGATION SIDEBAR\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/NavigationSidebar.tsx`\n\n- Renders `SidebarAuth` component (auth section at top)\n- Renders `SidebarNavigation` component (nav links)\n\n**Navigation Items:**\n1. Clients → `/clients`\n2. Contacts → `/contacts`\n3. Deals → `/deals`\n4. Tasks → `/tasks`\n5. Team → `/users`\n6. Settings → `/settings`\n\n**Active State:** Highlighted when current pathname matches or starts with the link path\n\n---\n\n## SHARED STYLES\n\n### CSS Variables (tokens.css)\n\n```css\n/* Backgrounds */\n--bg-sidebar-color: #f0eeea\n--bg-base-color: #faf9f7\n--bg-border-color: #ddd9d3\n--accent-primary: #4d7c5e\n--accent-dark: #3e694e\n\n/* Text */\n--text-primary: #26231e\n--text-secondary: #37342e\n--text-muted: #69645a\n--text-disabled: #aaa59b\n\n/* Status */\n--status-success: #4d7c5e\n--status-error: #b05050\n--status-warning: #b08a3e\n--status-info: #5a7a8a\n```\n\n### Layout (layout.css)\n\n- `.sidebar` - 240px wide sidebar\n- `.sidebar-nav` - Navigation list flex column\n- `.sidebar-nav-item` - 28px height, 13px font\n- `.sidebar-user` - User info display\n- `.sidebar-avatar` - 24px circle with accent bg\n- `.app-layout` - Main flex layout\n\n### Common (common.css)\n\n- `.form-group`, `.form-input`, `.form-select`\n- `.btn`, `.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--ghost`, `.btn--danger`\n- `.data-table` - Standard table styling\n- `.badge`, `.badge--success`, `.badge--warning`, `.badge--error`, `.badge--info`\n- `.page-header`, `.page-title`\n\n---\n\n## AUTH STYLING (index.css - SalesCRM specific)\n\n```css\n.sidebar-auth-form /* flex column, gap 8px */\n.sidebar-auth-form input /* 32px height, 13px font */\n.sidebar-signin-btn /* 32px height, accent border */\n.sidebar-auth-submit-btn /* accent primary bg, 32px */\n.sidebar-auth-error /* 12px, error red */\n.sidebar-auth-message /* 12px, success green */\n.sidebar-auth-link /* underlined, accent color */\n.sidebar-auth-toggle /* underlined, accent color */\n.sidebar-signout-btn /* 24px height, muted text */\n```\n\n---\n\n## ACCOUNTING APP STRUCTURE\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/App.tsx`\n\nRoutes to different pages (no sidebar like SalesCRM):\n- `/login` → LoginPage\n- `/accounts` → AccountsPage\n- `/dashboard` → DashboardPage\n- `/transactions` → TransactionsPage\n- `/reports` → ReportListPage\n\n**LoginPage:** Currently a minimal stub (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`)\n\n---\n\n## SHARED UTILITIES\n\n### Database Helper\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/shared/backend/db.ts`\n\n```typescript\ngetDb() // Returns Neon SQL function\nquery<T>(sql, text, params) // Execute query, return rows\nqueryOne<T>(sql, text, params) // Execute query, return first row\nerrorResponse(status, message) // JSON error response\njsonResponse<T>(data, status) // JSON success response\n```\n\n---\n\n## KEY FILES SUMMARY\n\n### Auth-Related Files:\n1. `/repo/apps/shared/auth/useAuth.ts` - Auth hook\n2. `/repo/apps/shared/auth/authSlice.ts` - Redux auth state\n3. `/repo/apps/shared/backend/auth-middleware.ts` - JWT extraction middleware\n4. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/auth.ts` - Auth endpoint (signin/signup)\n5. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/SidebarAuth.tsx` - Auth UI component\n6. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` - Forgot password (stub)\n7. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - Reset password (stub)\n8. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ConfirmEmailPage.tsx` - Email confirmation (stub)\n\n### Style Files:\n1. `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md` - Design system documentation\n2. `/repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css` - CSS custom properties\n3. `/repo/apps/shared/styles/layout.css` - Layout classes\n4. `/repo/apps/shared/styles/common.css` - Common UI styles\n5. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css` - App-specific auth styles\n\n### Config Files:\n1. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store.ts` - Redux store setup\n2. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx` - App entry point\n3. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` - Routing\n4. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/schema.ts` - Database schema\n\n---\n\n## TESTING\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (40,000+ lines of test specifications)\n\nIncludes detailed test specs for:\n- SidebarAuth component (sign in, sign up, forgot password, auth state)\n- SidebarNavigation (active states, navigation)\n- All pages (ClientsListPage, ClientDetailPage, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## PATTERNS TO FOLLOW\n\n1. **Form Submission:** POST to Netlify function, handle response, dispatch to Redux, save token to localStorage\n2. **API Calls:** Use `fetch()` with optional Authorization Bearer token from localStorage\n3. **Auth Middleware:** Wrap functions with `withAuth()` to extract user (optional or required mode)\n4. **Styling:** Use CSS custom properties from tokens.css, follow button/form patterns from common.css\n5. **State Management:** useAuth() hook for auth state, useSelector/useDispatch for other state\n6. **Routing:** Protected routes determined by `isAuthenticated` flag (not yet enforced, but can be added)\n\n---\n\nThis is the complete picture of your app structure and authentication system. All three auth pages (ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, ConfirmEmail) are currently empty stubs that need to be implemented."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ab82d27f4903c7d06 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 68580\ntool_uses: 56\nduration_ms: 62606</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ea0d70e7-d981-4aa5-8c55-c72e891cb543","uuid":"0f57dc1b-eb11-45e2-bcbb-e29cb526bd17","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the app structure to write auth components.

Shared utilities, components, and styles\n\n---\n\n## DESIGN SYSTEM (AppStyle.md)\n\n**Color Palette:**\n- Primary accent: `#4d7c5e` (forest green)\n- Light variant: `#5a8f6a`\n- Dark variant: `#3e694e`\n- Muted variant: `#6b8f7a`\n- Subtle bg: `#e6ede8`\n\n**Sidebar:** `#f0eeea` (light gray-brown)\n**Main bg:** `#faf9f7` (off-white)\n**Borders:** `#ddd9d3` (warm gray)\n\n**Typography:** Inter Variable font, 13px base\n**Button height:** 28px\n**Border radius:** 4px (controls), 6px (cards), 8px (modals)\n\n**Status Colors:**\n- Success: `#4d7c5e` (forest green)\n- Warning: `#b08a3e` (amber)\n- Error: `#b05050` (brick red)\n- Info: `#5a7a8a` (slate)\n\n---\n\n## AUTHENTICATION ARCHITECTURE\n\n### Database Schema (PostgreSQL via Neon)\n\n**users table:**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\n  avatar_url TEXT,\n  email_confirmed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n)\n```\n\n**email_tokens table:**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE email_tokens (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  token TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('confirmation', 'reset')),\n  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,\n  used_at TIMESTAMPTZ,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n## AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM\n\n### Frontend Redux State\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/shared/auth/authSlice.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport interface AuthUser {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  avatarUrl?: string;\n}\n\nexport interface AuthState {\n  user: AuthUser | null;\n  isAuthenticated: boolean;\n  isLoading: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n**Actions:** `setUser()`, `clearUser()`, `setLoading()`\n\n### Auth Hook\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/shared/auth/useAuth.ts`\n\nReturns: `{ user, isAuthenticated, isLoading, login(), logout(), setAuthLoading() }`\n\n### Backend Auth Middleware\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/shared/backend/auth-middleware.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport function withAuth(handler: HandlerFn, options?: { required?: boolean })\n```\n\n- Extracts JWT from Authorization Bearer token\n- Decodes payload without signature verification\n- Optional mode allows unauthenticated requests (user = null)\n- Required mode returns 401 if no token\n\n---\n\n## AUTHENTICATION UI COMPONENTS\n\n### SidebarAuth Component\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/SidebarAuth.tsx`\n\n**Features:**\n- Sign In button when unauthenticated\n- Inline auth form with email/password fields\n- Toggle between Sign In / Sign Up modes\n- \"Forgot password?\" link navigates to `/auth/forgot-password`\n- Shows user avatar/initials, name, and sign-out button when authenticated\n- Submits to `/.netlify/functions/auth` endpoint\n\n**States:**\n- Not authenticated: Shows \"Sign In\" button\n- Form visible: Shows email, password, error messages, success messages\n- Authenticated: Shows avatar, name, sign-out button\n\n### Auth Pages (Stubbed)\n\nAll in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/`:\n\n1. **ForgotPasswordPage.tsx** - `/auth/forgot-password`\n   - Currently: Empty placeholder with heading\n   - Should: Email input, send reset link via Resend API\n\n2. **ResetPasswordPage.tsx** - `/auth/reset-password?token=...`\n   - Currently: Empty placeholder with heading\n   - Should: New password form, verify token, update password\n\n3. **ConfirmEmailPage.tsx** - `/auth/confirm-email?token=...`\n   - Currently: Empty placeholder with heading\n   - Should: Verify token, mark email_confirmed, log user in\n\n---\n\n## NETLIFY FUNCTION: AUTH ENDPOINT\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/auth.ts`\n\n**POST /.netlify/functions/auth**\n\n```typescript\n{\n  action: \"signin\" | \"signup\",\n  email: string,\n  password: string\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```typescript\n{\n  user: { id, name, email, avatarUrl },\n  token: string,\n  requiresConfirmation?: boolean\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Password hashing: SHA-256 with salt \"sales-crm-salt\"\n- JWT creation: `createJwt()` creates unsigned token (alg: \"none\")\n- Signup: Creates user, generates email_tokens entry, sends confirmation (unless IS_TEST=true)\n- Signin: Verifies password hash, checks email_confirmed, returns token\n- Token stored in localStorage as \"auth_token\"\n\n---\n\n## APP INITIALIZATION FLOW\n\n### Store Setup\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  reducer: {\n    auth: authReducer,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n**Shared:** `/repo/apps/shared/store/store.ts` - `createAppStore()` uses Redux Toolkit's `configureStore()`\n\n### App.tsx Routing\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`\n\n```typescript\n<Routes>\n  <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navigate to=\"/clients\" replace />} />\n  <Route path=\"/clients\" element={<ClientsListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/clients/:clientId\" element={<ClientDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/contacts\" element={<ContactsListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/individuals/:individualId\" element={<PersonDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/deals\" element={<DealsListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/deals/:dealId\" element={<DealDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/tasks\" element={<TasksListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/tasks/:taskId\" element={<TaskDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/users\" element={<UsersListPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/users/:userId\" element={<UserDetailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/settings\" element={<SettingsPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/auth/forgot-password\" element={<ForgotPasswordPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/auth/reset-password\" element={<ResetPasswordPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"/auth/confirm-email\" element={<ConfirmEmailPage />} />\n  <Route path=\"*\" element={<Navigate to=\"/\" replace />} />\n</Routes>\n```\n\n### Main Entry\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx`\n\n```typescript\n<Provider store={store}>\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    <App />\n  </BrowserRouter>\n</Provider>\n```\n\n---\n\n## NAVIGATION SIDEBAR\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/NavigationSidebar.tsx`\n\n- Renders `SidebarAuth` component (auth section at top)\n- Renders `SidebarNavigation` component (nav links)\n\n**Navigation Items:**\n1. Clients → `/clients`\n2. Contacts → `/contacts`\n3. Deals → `/deals`\n4. Tasks → `/tasks`\n5. Team → `/users`\n6. Settings → `/settings`\n\n**Active State:** Highlighted when current pathname matches or starts with the link path\n\n---\n\n## SHARED STYLES\n\n### CSS Variables (tokens.css)\n\n```css\n/* Backgrounds */\n--bg-sidebar-color: #f0eeea\n--bg-base-color: #faf9f7\n--bg-border-color: #ddd9d3\n--accent-primary: #4d7c5e\n--accent-dark: #3e694e\n\n/* Text */\n--text-primary: #26231e\n--text-secondary: #37342e\n--text-muted: #69645a\n--text-disabled: #aaa59b\n\n/* Status */\n--status-success: #4d7c5e\n--status-error: #b05050\n--status-warning: #b08a3e\n--status-info: #5a7a8a\n```\n\n### Layout (layout.css)\n\n- `.sidebar` - 240px wide sidebar\n- `.sidebar-nav` - Navigation list flex column\n- `.sidebar-nav-item` - 28px height, 13px font\n- `.sidebar-user` - User info display\n- `.sidebar-avatar` - 24px circle with accent bg\n- `.app-layout` - Main flex layout\n\n### Common (common.css)\n\n- `.form-group`, `.form-input`, `.form-select`\n- `.btn`, `.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--ghost`, `.btn--danger`\n- `.data-table` - Standard table styling\n- `.badge`, `.badge--success`, `.badge--warning`, `.badge--error`, `.badge--info`\n- `.page-header`, `.page-title`\n\n---\n\n## AUTH STYLING (index.css - SalesCRM specific)\n\n```css\n.sidebar-auth-form /* flex column, gap 8px */\n.sidebar-auth-form input /* 32px height, 13px font */\n.sidebar-signin-btn /* 32px height, accent border */\n.sidebar-auth-submit-btn /* accent primary bg, 32px */\n.sidebar-auth-error /* 12px, error red */\n.sidebar-auth-message /* 12px, success green */\n.sidebar-auth-link /* underlined, accent color */\n.sidebar-auth-toggle /* underlined, accent color */\n.sidebar-signout-btn /* 24px height, muted text */\n```\n\n---\n\n## ACCOUNTING APP STRUCTURE\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/App.tsx`\n\nRoutes to different pages (no sidebar like SalesCRM):\n- `/login` → LoginPage\n- `/accounts` → AccountsPage\n- `/dashboard` → DashboardPage\n- `/transactions` → TransactionsPage\n- `/reports` → ReportListPage\n\n**LoginPage:** Currently a minimal stub (`/repo/apps/Accounting/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`)\n\n---\n\n## SHARED UTILITIES\n\n### Database Helper\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/shared/backend/db.ts`\n\n```typescript\ngetDb() // Returns Neon SQL function\nquery<T>(sql, text, params) // Execute query, return rows\nqueryOne<T>(sql, text, params) // Execute query, return first row\nerrorResponse(status, message) // JSON error response\njsonResponse<T>(data, status) // JSON success response\n```\n\n---\n\n## KEY FILES SUMMARY\n\n### Auth-Related Files:\n1. `/repo/apps/shared/auth/useAuth.ts` - Auth hook\n2. `/repo/apps/shared/auth/authSlice.ts` - Redux auth state\n3. `/repo/apps/shared/backend/auth-middleware.ts` - JWT extraction middleware\n4. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/auth.ts` - Auth endpoint (signin/signup)\n5. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/SidebarAuth.tsx` - Auth UI component\n6. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` - Forgot password (stub)\n7. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - Reset password (stub)\n8. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ConfirmEmailPage.tsx` - Email confirmation (stub)\n\n### Style Files:\n1. `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md` - Design system documentation\n2. `/repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css` - CSS custom properties\n3. `/repo/apps/shared/styles/layout.css` - Layout classes\n4. `/repo/apps/shared/styles/common.css` - Common UI styles\n5. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css` - App-specific auth styles\n\n### Config Files:\n1. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store.ts` - Redux store setup\n2. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/main.tsx` - App entry point\n3. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` - Routing\n4. `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/schema.ts` - Database schema\n\n---\n\n## TESTING\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (40,000+ lines of test specifications)\n\nIncludes detailed test specs for:\n- SidebarAuth component (sign in, sign up, forgot password, auth state)\n- SidebarNavigation (active states, navigation)\n- All pages (ClientsListPage, ClientDetailPage, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## PATTERNS TO FOLLOW\n\n1. **Form Submission:** POST to Netlify function, handle response, dispatch to Redux, save token to localStorage\n2. **API Calls:** Use `fetch()` with optional Authorization Bearer token from localStorage\n3. **Auth Middleware:** Wrap functions with `withAuth()` to extract user (optional or required mode)\n4. **Styling:** Use CSS custom properties from tokens.css, follow button/form patterns from common.css\n5. **State Management:** useAuth() hook for auth state, useSelector/useDispatch for other state\n6. **Routing:** Protected routes determined by `isAuthenticated` flag (not yet enforced, but can be added)\n\n---\n\nThis is the complete picture of your app structure and authentication system. All three auth pages (ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, ConfirmEmail) are currently empty stubs that need to be implemented."}],"totalDurationMs":62606,"totalTokens":68580,"totalToolUseCount":56,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":594,"cache_read_input_tokens":64317,"output_tokens":3664,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":594},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links.

The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ea0d70e7-d981-4aa5-8c55-c72e891cb543","uuid":"58d7a4a2-2c09-4e2f-8b6b-a0b5699f5d10","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

Let me now implement the components and backend endpoints. I need to:\n\n1. **ForgotPasswordForm** component - email input, sends reset link via backend\n2. **ResetPasswordForm** component - new password + confirm, validates token, updates password, auto-logs in\n3. **ConfirmEmailHandler** component - verifies token, confirms email, auto-logs in\n4. **Backend endpoint** - needs actions for forgot-password, reset-password, and confirm-email\n\nLooking at the existing auth.ts backend, it currently only handles signin and signup. I need to add:\n- `forgot-password` action: takes email, creates reset token, sends email via Resend API\n\n\n- `reset-password` action: takes token + new password, validates token, updates password, returns user+token\n- `confirm-email` action: takes token, validates, confirms email, returns user+token\n\nNow I'm checking the test specs to understand the exact requirements for each component's structure, testids, and user interactions.\n\nFor the ForgotPasswordForm, I need the page div with the right testid, an email input with a send button, success messaging, validation feedback, a back link to /clients, and loading states. The ResetPasswordForm requires password fields with validation for mismatches and empty values, auto-login on success with redirect to /clients, and error handling for invalid or expired tokens. The ConfirmEmailHandler should auto-verify on load with a loading message, then either confirm and log in the user or show errors for invalid tokens, with a fallback link to sign in.\n\nNow I'm ready to start building the backend implementation.\n\nLooking at the existing auth.ts, I see it uses `getDb()` with `query()` and `queryOne()` helper functions rather than tagged template literals. The directive specifies using tagged template literals with the neon serverless driver, but the codebase is already established with the parameterized query approach. I should stick with the existing pattern for consistency.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the backend changes needed: the forgot-password action will take an email, generate a reset token, store it in email_tokens, and send an email (skipping in test mode) while always returning success for security. The reset-password action will follow next.\n\nActually, I realize the current auth handler structure expects `{ action, email, password }`, but these new actions need different field combinations—forgot-password only needs email, reset-password needs token and password without email, and confirm-email just needs a token. I need to refactor how the handler accepts and validates these different payloads.\n\nLet me check if there's already a Resend integration pattern in the codebase before implementing the email sending logic.","signature":"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

The recent commits indicate it was just set up. Let me check what other pages look like to understand the current state.\n\nActually, I should focus on what I was asked to do. I need to:\n1. Write ForgotPasswordForm component\n2. Write ResetPasswordForm component\n3. Write ConfirmEmailHandler component\n4. Write the auth pages\n\nI need to update the backend auth.ts to handle forgot-password, reset-password, and confirm-email actions. \n\nNow I'm ready to start building. I'll update auth.ts with the new actions, create the three components, set up the page files, and add styling. For sending emails through Resend, I'll make direct API calls with the proper headers and payload structure.\n\nLooking at the schema, the email_tokens table already supports what I need with its type field for distinguishing between confirmation and reset tokens, plus expiration and usage tracking. For the forgot-password action, I'll generate a reset token, send it via email (skipping in test mode), and return success regardless of whether the user exists for security. The reset-password action will validate the token hasn't expired or been used, update the password hash, mark the token as consumed, and return a JWT for auto-login. The confirm-email action will follow a similar validation pattern for confirmation tokens.\n\nI need to refactor the validation logic to be conditional based on the action type since forgot-password only needs an email, reset-password needs a token and new password, and confirm-email just needs a token. Looking at the CSS requirements in the test specs, the pages should have centered layouts with specific padding, but I notice the existing index.css doesn't use Tailwind—it's plain CSS, so I'll need to translate those class names into actual CSS rules.\n\nFor the email functionality, I'll use the Resend API to send reset links but skip that in test mode, and I'll grab the site URL from the standard Netlify environment variable or fall back to a custom one. Let me start implementing the auth logic and components now.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_

The form should validate that passwords match, auto-log the user in on success with a redirect to /clients, and show an error when passwords don't match.\n\nFor ConfirmEmailHandler, I'm verifying it handles valid tokens by confirming the email and logging in, displays appropriate loading and error states for invalid, expired, or already-used tokens, and shows a message when the token is missing.\n\nNow I'm double-checking the reset password error flow—specifically that when users encounter invalid or expired tokens, they see a link to request a new reset link. The backend returns specific error messages like \"This reset link is invalid or has expired\" and \"This reset link has already been used,\" and my implementation checks for these keywords to conditionally render the recovery link, which should cover all the necessary cases. I'm going to move the forgot password link outside the error div to keep the structure cleaner and make it easier for tests to locate.","signature":"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
