No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data.

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings.

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":133,"startLine":1,"totalLines":133}}}

The test entries in docs/tests.md for ClientDetailPage haven't been written yet either (just a components list and a placeholder comment). Let me verify this by checking the actual state.\n\nLet me now systematically check each job:\n\n**Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientDetailPage** - Check testSpec.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage test entries\nLooking at docs/tests.md for ClientDetailPage (lines 315-327), there are:\n- Components listed\n- But NO actual test entries - just a placeholder comment \"<!-- Test entries will be added by PlanComponent jobs -->\"\n\n\nThis is itself a violation of the directives, which require systematically inventorying every visible element and writing a test entry for each one. Since there are no test entries at all, this represents a fundamental gap in following the testSpec.md strategy.\n\n**Job 2: CheckComponentsClientDetailPage** - Check writeApp.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage components\nI need to examine what the ClientDetailPage should actually contain by looking at AppSpec.md, then verify whether the components listed match what's required.\n\n**Job 3: CheckTestsClientDetailPage** - Check writeTests.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage tests\nSince the ClientDetailPage is still just a placeholder with no Playwright tests written yet, there's nothing to validate against the writeTests.md directives. The same applies to the app components—without an actual implementation, I can't check for violations. The real question is whether this absence itself constitutes a violation, but my checking strategy focuses on examining existing documentation and code for directive breaches. Let me look at the actual route setup to confirm the current state.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1701,"cache_read_input_tokens":40109,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1701,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"922004b3-0c01-470c-87bf-d639acd31014","uuid":"a188895c-e8d2-4fc9-a085-61d44f30028d"}

The ClientDetailPage is currently a placeholder - it hasn't been built yet. The docs/tests.md has the components listed for ClientDetailPage but no test entries have been written yet.\n\nLet me now systematically work through each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientDetailPage\n\nI need to check testSpec.md directives against the ClientDetailPage test entries. The directives from testSpec.md are:\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements. Prioritize consistent navigation/styling.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't implement shortcuts or easier alternatives when the mockup shows something specific.\n4. Every clickable element needs a test that specifies exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers.\n5. Any data-mutating actions require tests confirming the changes persist and all side effects happen.\n6. Button and control styling is important - tests should verify how they look, not just that they exist.\n7. Modal dialogs need comprehensive testing to ensure they function correctly.\n8. File upload functionality must be supported for attachments.\n9. Import and upload dialogs should clearly specify what data formats are expected.\n10. Backend configuration needs complete setup instructions visible in the UI.\n11. State-changing actions need tests covering other related impacts.\n\nThe ClientDetailPage currently has no test entries at all, just a component list and a placeholder note about PlanComponent jobs adding them later. That's a significant gap, though it might be intentional if those jobs haven't run yet. The strategy says to check existing entries for violations, so if there are no entries, there's technically nothing to check - but the absence itself is worth noting as incomplete. I'm realizing the distinction here—the directives describe how to write test entries, not whether they should exist. Since ClientDetailPage hasn't been built yet, there's nothing to check against the directives, so all three jobs would find no violations simply because there's no content to evaluate. I should work through each job systematically and document what I'm checking.","signature":"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
