No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`).

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`).

Pagination (lines 374-423)\n\nLet me also look at the existing component patterns to understand how other components are structured, and also check the docs/tests.md for the MaterialsPage to understand what test entries reference.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3963,"cache_read_input_tokens":34597,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3963,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"fe7be3a3-bc95-4131-a0e4-cea838a265e2","uuid":"fe5c6267-a6dd-49cf-bfb0-31c1485f9510"}

Let me read it to see if the MaterialsPage could use it. Also, the current MaterialsPage has a more custom pagination (with page number buttons and \"Showing X-Y of Z items\"). Let me check the shared Pagination component.\n\nLet me also check other pages in the app to see how they handle pagination and search, to make sure I maintain consistency.\n\nAlso, looking at the directive: \"All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\" This means I need to extract:\n1. Create Material Modal → CreateMaterialModal.tsx\n2. Create Category Modal → CreateCategoryModal.tsx  \n\n\n3. Search bar → part of the filter bar (but it's inline JSX in MaterialsPage)\n4. Sort Dropdown → SortDropdown.tsx\n5. Pagination → the shared component uses First/Previous/Next/Last buttons with \"Page X of Y\", but MaterialsPage has numbered page buttons with \"Showing X-Y of Z items\", so I need to decide whether to adapt the existing component or create a new one that matches the current design.\n\nLooking at the task, I need to extract these into separate files. The search input is just a wrapper around the search field within the filter bar, and the sort dropdown is already somewhat modular. For pagination, since the MaterialsPage pattern is different from the shared component, I'll extract it as its own component to preserve the current UI.\n\nLet me plan out the new components: CreateMaterialModal, CreateCategoryModal, MaterialsSearchBar for the search input, MaterialsSortDropdown for sorting, and MaterialsPagination for the pagination with numbered buttons.\n\nI should also verify the test file to make sure I don't break any data-testid references when I move these around.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2124,"cache_read_input_tokens":39044,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2124,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"fe7be3a3-bc95-4131-a0e4-cea838a265e2","uuid":"de581ef5-8e14-47a7-8045-18ab7befc14e"}

The tests.md lists the MaterialsPage components as:\n- NewMaterialButton\n- NewCategoryButton\n- SearchBar\n- CategoryFilter\n- AccountFilter\n- SortDropdown\n- MaterialsTable\n- Pagination\n\nThe directive says \"All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\" Currently in MaterialsPage.tsx, these are inline:\n1. The Create Material Modal (should be CreateMaterialModal component)\n2. The Create Category Modal (should be CreateCategoryModal component)\n3. The Search Bar (should be a SearchBar component)\n\n\n4. The Sort Dropdown (should be a SortDropdown component)\n5. The Pagination (should be a MaterialsPagination component)\n\nI can see MaterialsTable already exists, and CategoryFilter and AccountFilter both use the shared FilterSelect component. So I need to extract the remaining inline JSX into separate component files: CreateMaterialModal, CreateCategoryModal, SearchBar, and SortDropdown.\n\nActually, looking at the test references more carefully, they expect NewMaterialButton and NewCategoryButton as the component names—these wrap both the button and modal functionality together. The task description mentions extracting the modals themselves, but the tests are looking for button components that include the modal logic. Let me align with what the tests expect and create components that bundle the button with its associated modal.\n\nI also need to check the pagination implementation in MaterialsPage—it has numbered page buttons and a \"Showing X-Y of Z items\" display, which differs from the shared Pagination component that uses First/Prev/Next/Last navigation. Since the tests specifically require the numbered buttons and item count display, I'll need to build a custom pagination component rather than reusing the shared one.\n\nNow I'm going to create all five component files and then integrate them into MaterialsPage.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2224,"cache_read_input_tokens":49884,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2224,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"fe7be3a3-bc95-4131-a0e4-cea838a265e2","uuid":"becd2d6d-d148-4d96-ab1c-7b114cfab65d"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7.

Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   329→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   330→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   331→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n   332→  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n   333→  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n   334→- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n   335→  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n   336→  prevent with a quick source check.\n   337→- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n   338→  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n   339→  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n   340→  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n   341→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"fe7be3a3-bc95-4131-a0e4-cea838a265e2","uuid":"77cdc2d1-1326-4a05-8f5b-1a5e71803294","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/testing.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial testing task into a single task:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testing.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a task to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testing.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}
