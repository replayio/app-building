Patterns\n    59→\n    60→### When Replay Was Most Effective\n    61→\n    62→Replay was used on 9 of 33 failures (27%) and achieved a **100% debugging success rate** when used. It was most effective for:\n    63→\n    64→- **Visual/layout bugs** (CSS z-index, overflow issues): PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot was the go-to sequence for identifying why clicks weren't reaching elements. Used in 3 action menu failures.\n    65→- **Page-load and routing failures**: The full chain of PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot → ConsoleMessages → NetworkRequest → ReactComponents/ReactException was used to diagnose a blank-page issue caused by Netlify SPA redirects serving HTML for Vite module requests (MIME type errors).\n    66→- **Data-flow tracing**: SearchSources → Logpoint → NetworkRequest was used to trace a seed data mismatch where tests expected fictional assignee names not present in the database.\n    67→- **Timeout root-cause analysis**: PlaywrightSteps + NetworkRequest identified tight visibility timeouts and API response issues on detail pages.\n    68→\n    69→### When Replay Was NOT Used (24 instances)\n    70→\n    71→| Reason | Count |\n    72→|--------|-------|\n    73→| Diagnosed from error output alone | 18 |\n    74→| Pre-existing / unrelated failures | 4 |\n    75→| Recording upload failed (ERR_ASSERTION) | 2 |\n    76→| No recording available (infrastructure failure) | 1 |\n    77→| Raw test log with no agent session | 1 |\n    78→\n    79→The dominant reason (75%) was that the error output was sufficient to diagnose the issue. This typically happened for:\n    80→- Strict mode violations where the error clearly named the ambiguous locator\n    81→- Timeout errors in tests with obvious slow steps\n    82→- Cross-test data contamination visible from parallel test output\n    83→- Missing `data-testid` attributes clearly stated in error messages\n    84→\n    85→### Common Debugging Strategies That Worked\n    86→\n    87→1. **Error-output-first triage** (18/33 failures): Reading Playwright error messages directly. Works well for strict mode violations, missing selectors, and clear timeout messages.\n    88→2. **PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot** (used in 6/9 Replay sessions): The most common Replay sequence. Identifies which step stalled, then visually confirms page state.\n    89→3. **NetworkRequest for API verification** (used in 5/9 Replay sessions): Confirms whether backend returned correct data, isolating frontend vs backend issues.\n    90→4. **ConsoleMessages for JS errors** (used in 3/9 Replay sessions): Catches module loading failures, MIME type errors, and runtime exceptions.\n    91→5. **Logpoint for data-flow tracing** (used in 1/9 Replay sessions): Inspects runtime variable values to trace data mismatches through the component tree.\n    92→\n    93→### Common Debugging Strategies That Failed\n    94→\n    95→1. **Ignoring pre-existing failures**: 4 failures in `worker-…01-44-39.log` were pre-existing filter/sort issues. The agent correctly identified them as pre-existing but did not debug them, leaving them unresolved.\n    96→2. **Missing `data-testid` without Replay**: 2 TasksHeader failures were diagnosed from error output but not successfully fixed in that session — the agent noted the missing attribute but the fix was incomplete.\n    97→\n    98→### Recurring Failure Categories\n    99→\n   100→| Category | Count | % of Total |\n   101→|----------|-------|------------|\n   102→| Timeout / slow operations | 8 | 24% |\n   103→| Cross-test data contamination / parallel interference | 5 | 15% |\n   104→| Strict mode violations (ambiguous locators) | 4 | 12% |\n   105→| Pre-existing unrelated failures | 4 | 12% |\n   106→| CSS z-index / overflow / layout | 3 | 9% |\n   107→| Backend bugs (blanked fields, missing data) | 3 | 9% |\n   108→| Missing data-testid attributes | 2 | 6% |\n   109→| Test data mismatches (fictional vs seed data) | 1 | 3% |\n   110→| Infrastructure (DB auth) | 1 | 3% |\n   111→| SPA redirect / module loading | 1 | 3% |\n   112→| Recording upload failure | 2 | 6% |\n   113→\n   114→## 4. Recommendations\n   115→\n   116→### `skills/debugging/*.md`\n   117→\n   118→- **Add a \"PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot\" pattern** as the default first-line Replay debugging sequence. This was the most frequently used and successful combination (6/9 Replay uses).\n   119→- **Add a \"NetworkRequest for data verification\" pattern** as a standard second step when the UI renders but shows wrong data or times out waiting for content.\n   120→- **Add a \"Strict mode violation\" diagnostic pattern**: When Playwright reports \"strict mode violation\" with N matching elements, the fix is almost always to add more specific selectors (e.g., `nth`, `filter`, or `data-testid`). This can be diagnosed from error output alone — Replay is not needed.\n   121→- **Add a \"Cross-test contamination\" pattern**: When tests fail intermittently with unexpected data states, check for parallel test interference. Solutions include unique test data per worker, serial mode for stateful tests, or per-test DB cleanup.\n   122→- **Document the Logpoint + SearchSources strategy** for data-flow tracing when the UI renders but uses wrong values — trace from API response through state management to component props.\n   123→\n   124→### `skills/tasks/build/testing.md`\n   125→\n   126→- **Require unique test data per parallel worker**: 5 failures (15%) were caused by cross-test data contamination in `fullyParallel` mode. Tests that share mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) must either use unique identifiers or run serially.\n   127→- **Set generous initial timeouts for first-test cold starts**: The Vite dev server cold start caused the first test in some suites to timeout. Consider adding a warm-up navigation or increasing the first test's timeout.\n   128→- **Avoid hardcoded expected values**: Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g., \"expect 1 remaining task\") or specific names (e.g., \"David Lee\") break when test data changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data.\n   129→- **Validate seed data in tests**: The fictional assignee name bug (`worker-…04-27-52.log`) would have been caught if tests verified their test data existed before asserting on it.\n   130→- **Run `data-testid` validation before writing tests**: 2 failures were caused by missing `data-testid` attributes that tests expected. Consider a pre-test check that required test IDs exist in the component source.\n   131→\n   132→### `skills/review/reportTestFailures.md`\n   133→\n   134→- **Add a \"Failure Category\" field** to the per-log analysis template (e.g., timeout, strict-mode, data-contamination, CSS, infrastructure). This would simplify synthesis and enable automated categorization.\n   135→- **Add a \"Pre-existing\" boolean field**: 4 failures were pre-existing and unrelated to the current work. Flagging these explicitly would allow them to be filtered from success rate calculations. Adjusted success rate excluding pre-existing: 85% → 89% (24/27).\n   136→- **Add a \"Recording Available\" field**: Distinguishing \"Replay not used because not needed\" from \"Replay not used because recording was unavailable\" (2 upload failures + 1 infra failure) would give a more accurate picture of Replay adoption vs availability.\n   137→- **Track re-run count**: The number of test re-runs needed to achieve all-pass (e.g., 18 runs in `worker-…01-10-03.log`) is a useful efficiency metric not currently captured.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a47db9cb-63ab-48b0-9f28-58744d50ce58","uuid":"1e58d72d-017c-4bdb-90a6-a4f3af1a3ae4","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/reports/report-testFailures-sales-crm-2-review-5-20260224-164241.md","content":"# Test Failures Report: sales-crm-2-review-5\n\n**Generated**: 2026-02-24\n**Branch**: sales-crm-2-review-5\n**Report ID**: report-testFailures-sales-crm-2-review-5-20260224-164241\n\n## 1.

Fixed\nby adding a `runMigrations` function with ALTER TABLE statements.\n\n### Missing environment variables on deployment\nNetlify functions return errors because DATABASE_URL or other env vars aren't configured\non the Netlify site.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows function endpoints returning 500 or error\nJSON. ConsoleMessages shows connection/auth errors.\n\n**Fix**: Set env vars via `netlify env:set` or the Netlify dashboard.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T03-42-03-835Z.log` — Deployment test failed because Netlify\nfunctions lacked DATABASE_URL.\n\n### Database authentication errors\nA stale or rotated database password causes all API calls to fail with authentication errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows all data-fetching endpoints returning errors.\n\n**Fix**: Update the database connection string with the current password.\n\n### Import dialog closing before results display\nA component calls `onImported()` (which closes a dialog) before the import results are\navailable to display. The dialog unmounts, losing the results.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the import API call succeeding. SearchSources\nshows the results rendering code has 0 hits (component unmounted before it could render).\n\n**Fix**: Delay calling `onImported()` until after results are displayed, or keep the dialog\nopen until the user dismisses it.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T09-35-37-625Z.log` — Import dialog test. Replay showed the\nAPI succeeded but `onImported()` closed the dialog before results rendered.\n\n### Database CHECK constraint violation\nA form sends a value that violates a database CHECK constraint (e.g., status `'active'` when\nthe column only allows `'open'`, `'won'`, `'lost'`). The API returns 500 but the error\nmessage may not clearly indicate which value is invalid.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the POST/PUT returning 500. Logpoint on the\nhandler reveals the exact constraint error (e.g., `new row violates check constraint`).\nReadSource on the handler confirms which values are sent.\n\n**Fix**: Update the form/component to send only values that match the database enum.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T17-31-25-892Z.log` — CreateDealModal sent `'on_track'` as\nstatus but DB only accepted `'open'`/`'won'`/`'lost'`. 10 Replay tools used to trace.\n\n### Stale dev server with deleted Neon branch\nWhen `reuseExistingServer` in Playwright config reuses a dev server whose `DATABASE_URL`\npoints to a deleted ephemeral Neon branch, all API calls fail with auth or connection errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows no API calls or all returning errors.\nLocalStorage + GetStack traces the auth token lifecycle to find where it breaks. The\nrecording shows the frontend working but all data requests failing.\n\n**Fix**: Kill the stale dev server and let Playwright start a fresh one with the correct\n`DATABASE_URL`. Set `reuseExistingServer: false` or add cleanup logic.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-18T19-13-46-356Z.log` — 8 Replay tools traced from \"no API\ncalls\" → \"auth token removed\" → \"JWT ok but DB query fails on deleted branch\".\n","numLines":101,"startLine":1,"totalLines":101}}}

InspectElement reveals `type=\"email\"` on the input.\n\n**Fix**: Add `noValidate` to the `<form>` element to disable browser-native validation,\nallowing the app's custom validation to handle all cases.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T04-24-50-090Z.log` — Forgot-password \"Submit with Invalid\nEmail Format\" test. PlaywrightSteps confirmed click, but form handler never fired.\n\n### Native `<select>` vs. custom dropdown\nPlaywright's `.selectOption()` only works on native `<select>` elements. If the component\nrenders a custom dropdown (buttons + divs styled to look like a select), `selectOption()`\nwill fail or do nothing.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: PlaywrightSteps shows selectOption step with no effect.\nInspectElement shows the element is a `<button>` or `<div>`, not a `<select>`.\n\n**Fix**: Use click-based interactions for custom dropdowns: click the trigger, wait for the\noptions panel, click the desired option.\n\n### CSS hover interactions not triggering in Replay Chromium\nCSS `group-hover:opacity-100` may not reliably trigger from Playwright's programmatic hover\nin the Replay Chromium browser. The element stays at `opacity-0` even after hover.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: PlaywrightSteps shows hover action completed. Screenshot shows\nthe element is still invisible (opacity 0).\n\n**Fix**: Don't assert CSS opacity state. Use `force: true` on the click, and verify the\nfunctional outcome (e.g., row disappears after delete) instead of the visual hover state.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T05-32-01-460Z.log` — \"Delete on Hover\" test. Hover didn't\ntrigger opacity change. Fixed with `force:true` click + functional assertion.\n\n### `toBeChecked` targeting label instead of input\n`toBeChecked()` only works on `<input>` elements. If the test targets the `<label>` wrapping\na checkbox, the assertion fails even though the checkbox is checked.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: PlaywrightSteps shows the toggle click succeeded. InspectElement\non the asserted element shows it's a `<label>`, not an `<input>`.\n\n**Fix**: Target the `<input>` element inside the label for `toBeChecked` assertions.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-20T13-25-51-930Z.log` — STP-WH-07 webhook toggle. Replay showed\n`toBeChecked` was called on a `<label>`, not the underlying `<input>`.\n\n### `data-testid` on sr-only/hidden input\nWhen a `data-testid` is placed on a hidden `sr-only` input (e.g., inside an accessible\ncheckbox/toggle), Playwright's click action times out because the element has zero dimensions.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: PlaywrightSteps shows the click step timing out. Logpoint on the\nevent handler confirms 0 hits (the click never reached the handler).\n\n**Fix**: Move the `data-testid` to the visible label or wrapper element that the user would\nactually click.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-20T13-25-51-930Z.log` — STP-WH-07 webhook toggle. The testid was\non the hidden `sr-only` input. Moving it to the visible label fixed the timeout.\n","numLines":91,"startLine":1,"totalLines":91}}}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   175→   on what you found.\n   176→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   177→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   178→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   179→\n   180→### Bug Writeup Template\n   181→\n   182→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   183→\n   184→```\n   185→# Bug: <test name>\n   186→\n   187→## Step 1: Evidence\n   188→\n   189→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   190→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   191→no evidence.>\n   192→\n   193→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   194→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   195→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   196→\n   197→## Step 2: Determination\n   198→\n   199→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   200→\n   201→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   202→\n   203→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   204→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   205→```\n   206→\n   207→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   208→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   209→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   210→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   211→\n   212→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   213→\n   214→## Directives\n   215→\n   216→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   217→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   218→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   219→\n   220→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   222→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   223→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   224→\n   225→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   226→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   227→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   228→\n   229→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   230→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   231→\n   232→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   233→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   234→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   235→\n   236→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   237→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   238→\n   239→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   240→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   241→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   242→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   243→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   244→\n   245→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   246→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   247→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   248→\n   249→## Tips\n   250→\n   251→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   252→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   253→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   254→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   255→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   256→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   257→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   258→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   259→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   260→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   261→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   262→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   263→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   264→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   265→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   266→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   267→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   268→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   269→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   270→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   271→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   272→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   273→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   274→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   275→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   276→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   277→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   278→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   279→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   280→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   281→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   282→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   283→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   284→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   285→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   286→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   287→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   288→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   289→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   290→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   291→  database branches).

Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":292,"startLine":1,"totalLines":292}}}

Let me apply the recommendations from the report:\n\n### Recommendations for `skills/debugging/*.md`:\n\n1. **Add a \"PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot\" pattern** as the default first-line Replay debugging sequence\n2. **Add a \"NetworkRequest for data verification\" pattern** as a standard second step\n3. **Add a \"Strict mode violation\" diagnostic pattern**\n4. **Add a \"Cross-test contamination\" pattern**\n5. **Document the Logpoint + SearchSources strategy** for data-flow tracing\n\nLet me think about where to add these:\n\n1. \"PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot\" - This is already somewhat covered in timeouts.md (tool sequence steps 1-2) and in the README quick reference. But it's not explicitly called out as a \"default first-line\" pattern. \n\nI should add it to README.md as a first-line pattern.\n\n2. \"NetworkRequest for data verification\" - This is already covered in network-and-api.md, but the recommendation is to highlight it as a standard second step when the UI renders but shows wrong data or times out waiting for content. I could add this to README.md as well.\n\n3. \"Strict mode violation\" - This is a new pattern that doesn't have a clear home yet. It's related to Playwright locator issues, so it could go in form-and-input.md or become its own file. The core issue is that strict mode violations occur when Playwright locators match multiple elements.\n\n4. \"Cross-test contamination\" - This is partially covered in race-conditions.md, so I should expand that section with more detail.\n\n5. \"Logpoint + SearchSources strategy\" - This is already partially covered in network-and-api.md and seed-data.md, so I could consolidate it in one of those files or add it to README.md.\n\nI think the best approach is to be conservative and add these patterns to the most appropriate existing files: \"PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot\" as the default first-line pattern in README.md, \"NetworkRequest for data verification\" as the second step in README.md, and \"Strict mode violation\" as a new quick diagnostic pattern in README.md since it doesn't require Replay.\n\nNow I'm refining my strategy: I should add a \"Default First-Line Sequence\" section to README.md above the Quick Reference table to explain the PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot

The root cause is\nusually parallel tests modifying shared state, or async operations completing in an unexpected\norder. Replay recordings capture the exact execution, making the non-determinism visible.\n\n## Tool Sequence\n\n1. **`PlaywrightSteps`** — Establish the test flow. Identify which step's assertion failed\n   and what value it received vs. expected.\n\n2. **`Logpoint`** — Place logpoints on the code that produces the contested value. Inspect\n   how many times it was called and what values flowed through. Key locations:\n   - API response handlers (where state is set from fetched data)\n   - Redux/state dispatches\n   - Component render functions (to see re-render counts)\n\n3. **`SearchSources`** — Check hit counts on specific lines. If a line that should execute\n   once has multiple hits, something is triggering it repeatedly (e.g., React strict mode\n   double-firing effects, or concurrent test workers hitting the same endpoint).\n\n4. **`Evaluate`** — Evaluate expressions at specific execution points to inspect intermediate\n   state. Useful for checking array lengths, object properties, or computed values at the\n   exact moment an assertion runs.\n\n5. **`NetworkRequest`** — Check for overlapping or out-of-order API calls. A common pattern:\n   a PATCH (optimistic update) followed by a GET (refresh), where the GET response arrives\n   after the PATCH and overwrites the optimistic state with stale data.\n\n## Common Root Causes (from observed failures)\n\n### Parallel test interference on shared records\nMultiple tests in the same spec file modify the same database record (e.g., adding\nrelationships to the same person). Count-based assertions (`toHaveCount(1)`) fail because\nanother test added an extra record concurrently.\n\n**Fix**: Switch from count-based assertions to name-based assertions (check for a specific\nitem by name rather than exact count). Or create isolated test data per test.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-20T21-05-51-266Z.log` — PDP-REL-04a expected relationship count 1,\ngot 2. Logpoints showed a parallel test added a relationship to the same person simultaneously.\n\n### Optimistic update overwritten by late GET response\nA test clicks a toggle (PATCH request), then immediately asserts the new state. But a\npreviously-triggered GET request returns with stale data and overwrites the optimistic update.\n\n**Fix**: Intercept routes in the test to prevent the stale GET from overwriting, or wait for\nthe GET to complete before asserting.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T09-35-37-625Z.log` — Webhook toggle test. SearchSources showed\nthe GET response handler had more hits than expected, and the late GET overwrote the PATCH\nresult.\n\n### React strict mode double-firing effects\nIn development mode, React strict mode runs effects twice. If an effect makes an API call\n(e.g., fetching data on mount), the second call's response can arrive and overwrite state\nset by earlier interactions.\n\n**Fix**: Ensure effects are idempotent, or use abort controllers to cancel stale requests.\n\n### Date.now() or shared identifiers across workers\nWhen parallel Playwright workers share a module-level `Date.now()` value for generating\nunique IDs (like test emails), all workers get the same value, causing collisions.\n\n**Fix**: Generate unique values inside `beforeAll`/`beforeEach` using `Math.random()` or\nworker-specific identifiers.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T04-44-16-693Z.log` — Parallel workers tried to sign up with\nthe same email (Date.now() evaluated at module load).

Check:\n   - Did the expected API call happen?\n   - What status code was returned?\n   - What was the response body?\n   - Were there unexpected duplicate requests?\n\n2. **`ConsoleMessages`** — Check for logged errors from failed fetch calls.\n\n3. **`Logpoint`** — Place logpoints on API handler code (Netlify functions) or frontend\n   fetch calls to inspect request/response data at runtime. Useful for seeing:\n   - What parameters were sent to the API\n   - What the database query returned\n   - How the response was transformed before reaching the UI\n\n4. **`SearchSources`** — Check hit counts on API handler lines. If a handler was called\n   0 times, the request never reached it (routing issue). If called more times than expected,\n   something is triggering duplicate requests.\n\n5. **`ReadSource`** — Read the actual source code of API handlers to verify the logic.\n\n## Common Root Causes (from observed failures)\n\n### Missing database columns (schema migration)\n`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` doesn't modify existing tables. When new columns are added to\nthe schema definition, existing ephemeral branches don't get them.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows API returning 500. ConsoleMessages or test\noutput shows `NeonDbError: column \"X\" does not exist`.\n\n**Fix**: Add `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` migration statements.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T04-05-00-483Z.log` — \"column owner_id does not exist\". Fixed\nby adding a `runMigrations` function with ALTER TABLE statements.\n\n### Missing environment variables on deployment\nNetlify functions return errors because DATABASE_URL or other env vars aren't configured\non the Netlify site.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows function endpoints returning 500 or error\nJSON. ConsoleMessages shows connection/auth errors.\n\n**Fix**: Set env vars via `netlify env:set` or the Netlify dashboard.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T03-42-03-835Z.log` — Deployment test failed because Netlify\nfunctions lacked DATABASE_URL.\n\n### Database authentication errors\nA stale or rotated database password causes all API calls to fail with authentication errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows all data-fetching endpoints returning errors.\n\n**Fix**: Update the database connection string with the current password.\n\n### Import dialog closing before results display\nA component calls `onImported()` (which closes a dialog) before the import results are\navailable to display. The dialog unmounts, losing the results.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the import API call succeeding. SearchSources\nshows the results rendering code has 0 hits (component unmounted before it could render).\n\n**Fix**: Delay calling `onImported()` until after results are displayed, or keep the dialog\nopen until the user dismisses it.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T09-35-37-625Z.log` — Import dialog test. Replay showed the\nAPI succeeded but `onImported()` closed the dialog before results rendered.\n\n### Database CHECK constraint violation\nA form sends a value that violates a database CHECK constraint (e.g., status `'active'` when\nthe column only allows `'open'`, `'won'`, `'lost'`). The API returns 500 but the error\nmessage may not clearly indicate which value is invalid.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the POST/PUT returning 500. Logpoint on the\nhandler reveals the exact constraint error (e.g., `new row violates check constraint`).\nReadSource on the handler confirms which values are sent.\n\n**Fix**: Update the form/component to send only values that match the database enum.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T17-31-25-892Z.log` — CreateDealModal sent `'on_track'` as\nstatus but DB only accepted `'open'`/`'won'`/`'lost'`. 10 Replay tools used to trace.\n\n### Stale dev server with deleted Neon branch\nWhen `reuseExistingServer` in Playwright config reuses a dev server whose `DATABASE_URL`\npoints to a deleted ephemeral Neon branch, all API calls fail with auth or connection errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows no API calls or all returning errors.\nLocalStorage + GetStack traces the auth token lifecycle to find where it breaks. The\nrecording shows the frontend working but all data requests failing.\n\n**Fix**: Kill the stale dev server and let Playwright start a fresh one with the correct\n`DATABASE_URL`. Set `reuseExistingServer: false` or add cleanup logic.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-18T19-13-46-356Z.log` — 8 Replay tools traced from \"no API\ncalls\" → \"auth token removed\" → \"JWT ok but DB query fails on deleted branch\".\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":25,"oldLines":6,"newStart":25,"newLines":26,"lines":[" "," 5. **`ReadSource`** — Read the actual source code of API handlers to verify the logic."," ","+## Data-Flow Tracing with Logpoint + SearchSources","+","+When the UI renders but displays wrong values (wrong names, incorrect counts, stale data),","+use this sequence to trace data from API response through state management to component props:","+","+1. **`SearchSources`** — Search for the API handler or fetch call.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":289,"oldLines":3,"newStart":289,"newLines":18,"lines":["   OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites.
