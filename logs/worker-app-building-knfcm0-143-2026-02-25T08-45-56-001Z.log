Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root.

Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"21dbbf83-7c59-41fb-a9bd-b53b1b433a70","uuid":"0443d916-e700-48e5-8d38-63b7cd1964f9","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01Y7bN9uUDEsbVEhtx3vLoa4","session_id":"21dbbf83-7c59-41fb-a9bd-b53b1b433a70","uuid":"889a6ea8-f005-452d-a608-13f7e5013534"}

See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n    24→3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    25→   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    26→\n    27→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    28→matching skill.

For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    39→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    40→\n    41→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    42→\n    43→## Task System\n    44→\n    45→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    67→\n    68→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n    69→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    98→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    99→\n   100→## Database\n   101→\n   102→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   103→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   104→frontend components.\n   105→\n   106→## Quality Gates\n   107→\n   108→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`).

Key Insights for Component Writing**\n\n1. **NavigationSidebar is Already Complete** - It handles both navigation AND authentication. The spec mentions separate \"SidebarNavigation\" and \"SidebarAuth\" components in tests, but they're currently merged.\n\n2. **Current Components Are Placeholders** - All page files just have basic `<h1>` tags. You'll need to build the actual UI.\n\n3. **Design System is Well-Defined** - Use the CSS custom properties and existing styles. The app follows a warm, minimal aesthetic with forest green accents.\n\n4. **Authentication Flow is Implemented**:\n   - Frontend form in NavigationSidebar\n   - Backend endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/auth`\n   - Token stored in localStorage\n   - Redux-based auth state via useAuth()\n\n5. **Shared Resources Available**:\n   - `useAuth()` hook for authentication\n   - CSS tokens and layout styles\n   - Common components and utilities in `/repo/apps/shared/`\n\n6. **All Pages Need Implementation** - Every page file is just a placeholder and needs full UI implementation according to AppSpec and test specifications.\n\n---\n\nAll relevant files are available at these absolute paths:\n- **AppSpec**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md`\n- **Style Guide**: `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md`\n- **Test Spec**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`\n- **Navigation Sidebar**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/NavigationSidebar.tsx`\n- **Shared Styles**: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/` (tokens.css, layout.css, common.css)\n- **Shared Auth**: `/repo/apps/shared/auth/useAuth.ts`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ae6058ddcbe7bd8ef (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 50167\ntool_uses: 33\nduration_ms: 46662</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"21dbbf83-7c59-41fb-a9bd-b53b1b433a70","uuid":"10247fed-fb99-4908-bf77-9f3db02c474b","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the repository structure for the app being built.

Shared Resources**\n\n### **Auth Hook** (`/repo/apps/shared/auth/useAuth.ts`)\n```ts\nuseAuth() returns:\n- user: AuthUser (id, name, email, avatarUrl)\n- isAuthenticated: boolean\n- isLoading: boolean\n- login(userData): void\n- logout(): void\n- setAuthLoading(boolean): void\n```\n\n### **Shared Layout Components** (`/repo/apps/shared/layout/`)\n- **AppLayout** - Provides app-level layout with sidebar\n- **Sidebar** - Reusable sidebar component (not currently used in SalesCRM)\n\n### **Shared Styles** (`/repo/apps/shared/styles/`)\n- **tokens.css** - Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)\n- **layout.css** - Sidebar and layout styles\n- **common.css** - Form controls, buttons, tables, badges, etc.\n\n### **CSS Variables Available**:\n```css\n--bg-sidebar-color: #f0eeea\n--bg-base-color: #faf9f7\n--accent-primary: #4d7c5e\n--accent-dark: #3e694e\n--accent-light: #5a8f6a\n--text-primary: #26231e\n--text-secondary: #37342e\n--text-muted: #69645a\n--sidebar-width: 240px\n```\n\n---\n\n## **7. Current CSS Styles in SalesCRM** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/index.css`)\n\n### **Layout**:\n```css\n.sidebar-layout { display: flex; min-height: 100vh; }\n.sidebar-main { flex: 1; min-width: 0; display: flex; flex-direction: column; }\n```\n\n### **Sidebar Auth Styles**:\n- `.sidebar-user-area` - User section styling\n- `.sidebar-signin-btn` - Green bordered button\n- `.sidebar-auth-form` - Flex column with 8px gap\n- `.sidebar-auth-form input` - 32px height, styled inputs\n- `.sidebar-auth-submit-btn` - Green filled button\n- `.sidebar-auth-error` - Red error text\n- `.sidebar-auth-links` - Flex with space-between\n- `.sidebar-auth-link`, `.sidebar-auth-toggle` - Blue underlined links\n- `.sidebar-signout-btn` - Small gray button\n\n---\n\n## **8. File Structure**\n\n```\n/repo/apps/SalesCRM/\n├── src/\n│   ├── App.tsx (main app component with routes)\n│   ├── index.css (app-specific styles)\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   ├── hooks.ts\n│   ├── store.ts\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   └── NavigationSidebar.tsx (main sidebar - ALREADY COMPLETE)\n│   └── pages/\n│       ├── ClientsListPage.tsx\n│       ├── ClientDetailPage.tsx\n│       ├── ContactsListPage.tsx (was \"Contacts\")\n│       ├── PersonDetailPage.tsx\n│       ├── DealsListPage.tsx\n│       ├── DealDetailPage.tsx\n│       ├── TasksListPage.tsx\n│       ├── TaskDetailPage.tsx\n│       ├── UsersListPage.tsx\n│       ├── UserDetailPage.tsx\n│       ├── SettingsPage.tsx\n│       └── Auth pages...\n├── docs/\n│   ├── tests.md (comprehensive test specification)\n│   └── mockups (PNG images of UI designs)\n└── AppSpec.md (app specification)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **9. Key Insights for Component Writing**\n\n1. **NavigationSidebar is Already Complete** - It handles both navigation AND authentication. The spec mentions separate \"SidebarNavigation\" and \"SidebarAuth\" components in tests, but they're currently merged.\n\n2. **Current Components Are Placeholders** - All page files just have basic `<h1>` tags. You'll need to build the actual UI.\n\n3. **Design System is Well-Defined** - Use the CSS custom properties and existing styles. The app follows a warm, minimal aesthetic with forest green accents.\n\n4. **Authentication Flow is Implemented**:\n   - Frontend form in NavigationSidebar\n   - Backend endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/auth`\n   - Token stored in localStorage\n   - Redux-based auth state via useAuth()\n\n5. **Shared Resources Available**:\n   - `useAuth()` hook for authentication\n   - CSS tokens and layout styles\n   - Common components and utilities in `/repo/apps/shared/`\n\n6. **All Pages Need Implementation** - Every page file is just a placeholder and needs full UI implementation according to AppSpec and test specifications.\n\n---\n\nAll relevant files are available at these absolute paths:\n- **AppSpec**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md`\n- **Style Guide**: `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md`\n- **Test Spec**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`\n- **Navigation Sidebar**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/NavigationSidebar.tsx`\n- **Shared Styles**: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/` (tokens.css, layout.css, common.css)\n- **Shared Auth**: `/repo/apps/shared/auth/useAuth.ts`"}],"totalDurationMs":46662,"totalTokens":50167,"totalToolUseCount":33,"usage":{"input_tokens":1785,"cache_creation_input_tokens":236,"cache_read_input_tokens":45767,"output_tokens":2379,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":236},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}
