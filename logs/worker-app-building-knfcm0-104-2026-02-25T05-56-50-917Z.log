There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    69→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    70→\n    71→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    72→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a386feae-cbfc-44e6-a579-1717c33a84af","uuid":"114b943f-f9c1-4f57-8aae-4bd5ea1e64c4","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports.

The layout consists of the account name and category (asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense) at the top, followed by a transaction list or ledger. Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n    15→   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

The layout likely includes controls or filters for selecting report type (e.g., summary, detailed, category-based), date ranges, and which accounts or categories (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) to include. The page also provides functionality to refresh or regenerate reports based on new parameters and may link back to specific account detail pages when users click on report items. Budget versus actual comparisons are a core feature of these reports.\n    20→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdH0QZwUJBicXIxYl7ANfnRyzLoKQCwtb1e8Wj\n    21→\n    22→5.

CSS/STYLING APPROACH\n\n### **Architecture**:\n1. **Tokens** (`@shared/styles/tokens.css`) - CSS variables for:\n   - Colors (backgrounds, text, accents, status colors)\n   - Shadows\n   - Typography\n   - Sizing\n\n2. **Common Styles** (`@shared/styles/common.css`) - Reusable classes:\n   - `.form-group`, `.form-label`, `.form-input`, `.form-select`\n   - `.btn`, `.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--ghost`, `.btn--danger`\n   - `.data-table` with th, td, hover effects\n   - `.badge`, `.badge--complete`, `.badge--pending`\n   - `.searchable-select` with dropdown\n\n3. **Layout** (`@shared/styles/layout.css`) - Page structure, responsive utilities\n\n4. **App-Specific** (`src/index.css`) - 900+ lines including:\n   - NavBar styles\n   - Account card styles\n   - Modal styles\n   - Form elements\n   - Budget progress bars\n   - Tabs\n\n### **Key CSS Classes**:\n\n**Modal Structure**:\n```css\n.modal-overlay { /* fixed, full-screen, semi-transparent backdrop */ }\n.modal-content { /* centered box, 90% width, max 720px */ }\n.modal-header { /* flex, space-between */ }\n.modal-title { /* 18px, 600 weight */ }\n.modal-close-btn { /* 28x28, transparent bg, hover bg change */ }\n.modal-footer { /* flex, justify-end, gap 8px */ }\n.form-group { /* flex column, gap 4px, margin-bottom 16px */ }\n.form-label { /* 12px, 500 weight, muted color */ }\n.form-input { /* 36px height, padding, border, focus ring */ }\n```\n\n**Line Items Table**:\n```css\n.line-items-header,\n.line-item-row { \n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 120px 140px 36px;\n  /* Account | Type | Amount | Delete Button */\n}\n```\n\n**Budget Progress Bars**:\n```css\n.budget-bar-track { /* 6px height, light background */ }\n.budget-bar-fill { /* transitions width */ }\n.budget-bar-fill--warning { /* yellow/orange */ }\n.budget-bar-fill--over { /* red */ }\n```\n\n**Color Scheme**:\n- Primary accent: `--accent-primary: #4d7c5e` (green)\n- Success: `--status-success: #4d7c5e`\n- Warning: `--status-warning: #b08a3e` (amber)\n- Error: `--status-error: #b05050` (red)\n- Text primary: `#26231e` (dark brown)\n- Text secondary: `#37342e`\n- Text muted: `#69645a`\n- Background: `--bg-base-color: #faf9f7` (off-white)\n- Border: `--bg-border-color: #ddd9d3`\n\n**Transaction Direction Badges**:\n- Debit: `background: #f5e3e3; color: --status-error`\n- Credit: `background: #e6ede8; color: --status-success`\n\n---\n\n## 8. SHARED COMPONENTS (in `/repo/apps/shared`)\n\n### **SearchableSelect** (`components/SearchableSelect.tsx`)\n- Dropdown with search/filter\n- Used in NewTransactionModal for account selection\n- Props: `options`, `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `testId`\n- Behavior: Search on focus, blur hides dropdown, mousedown selects\n\n### **CategorySection** (`components/CategorySection.tsx`)\n- Collapsible category groups\n- Generic `<T>` for any item type\n- Shows header with chevron, title, total\n- Props: `title`, `items`, `defaultExpanded`, `total`, `renderItem`, `getItemKey`\n- Has both single CategorySection and CategoryGroup variants\n- Used on AccountsPage for Assets/Liabilities/etc.\n\n### **CategorySection.css** - Styling for sections:\n```css\n.category-section\n.category-section-header\n.category-section-chevron { /* rotates on expand */ }\n.category-section-title\n.category-section-total\n.category-section-content { /* grid layout */ }\n```\n\n### **Breadcrumb** (`components/Breadcrumb.tsx`)\n- Navigation trail\n- Used in NavBar and AccountDetailPage\n\n### **Other Shared Components**:\n- FilterSelect, ConfirmDialog, ImportDialog, TimelineSection, CommentsSection, DocumentsSection, Pagination\n\n### **Shared Auth** (`auth/authSlice.ts`)\n```typescript\ninterface AuthUser {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  email: string\n  avatarUrl?: string\n}\n\ninterface AuthState {\n  user: AuthUser | null\n  isAuthenticated: boolean\n  isLoading: boolean\n}\n\n// Reducers: setUser, clearUser, setLoading\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. FORM PATTERNS & VALIDATION\n\n### **NewTransactionModal Form Pattern**:\n1. **State Management**: Local state for all form fields\n2. **Validation**:\n   - Running calculations: `totalDebits`, `totalCredits`, `isBalanced`\n   - Balance check: `Math.abs(totalDebits - totalCredits) < 0.005`\n   - Submit button disabled if: `!description.trim() || !isBalanced || submitting`\n3. **Line Items**:\n   - Array state with add/remove/update functions\n   - Minimum 2 rows enforced\n   - Delete button disabled when <= 2 rows\n4. **Tags**:\n   - Array state\n   - Enter key adds new tag\n   - Click remove button deletes tag\n5. **Async Submission**:\n   - Sets submitting state\n   - Dispatches thunk, unwraps, then fetches fresh accounts\n   - Calls onClose on success\n   - Doesn't reset submitting on error (lets modal close naturally)\n\n### **CreateReportDialog Form Pattern**:\n1. **Controlled Inputs**: All form fields have onChange handlers\n2. **Type Selection**: Button group (not radio), toggles state\n3. **Date Validation**: Both dates required for submit\n4. **Submission**: Same async pattern with unwrap\n\n---\n\n## 10. MODAL/DIALOG IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### **Structure Pattern**:\n```tsx\n<div className=\"modal-overlay\" onClick={onClose}>\n  <div className=\"modal-content\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n    <div className=\"modal-header\">\n      <h2 className=\"modal-title\">Title</h2>\n      <button className=\"modal-close-btn\" onClick={onClose}>✕</button>\n    </div>\n    \n    {/* Form content */}\n    \n    <div className=\"modal-footer\">\n      <button className=\"btn btn--secondary\" onClick={onClose}>Cancel</button>\n      <button className=\"btn btn--primary\" onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={...}>\n        Save\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### **Z-index**: `.modal-overlay` has `z-index: 1000`\n\n### **Styling**:\n- Overlay: `position: fixed; inset: 0; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`\n- Content: `max-width: 720px; width: 90%; max-height: 90vh; overflow-y: auto`\n- Always centered with flexbox\n\n---\n\n## 11. TEST SPECIFICATION (`docs/tests.md`)\n\nThe tests.md file (1245 lines) covers:\n\n### **Components Tested**:\n- NavBar: Logo, navigation, active states, new transaction modal\n- AccountsOverviewHeader: Title, generate reports button\n- CategorySection: Display, expand/collapse, totals, default states\n- AccountCard: Name/balance display, menu actions, budget bars, performance, savings goals\n- TransactionsTab: Table layout, sorting, direction badges, view/edit actions\n- BudgetDetailsTab: Budget items, progress bars\n\n### **Pages Tested**:\n- AccountsPage: Category display, account cards, navigation\n- AccountDetailPage: Header, search, tabs, budget overview\n- ReportListPage: (stubs)\n- ReportDetailsPage: (stubs)\n\n### **Dialog Tests**:\n- NewTransactionModal: Line items, validation, balance indicator, submission\n- CreateReportDialog: Form fields, type selection, date validation\n\n### **Key Test Patterns**:\n- Initial state → User action → Expected result\n- Visual verification (colors, text, structure)\n- Interaction verification (clicks, state changes)\n- Integration verification (navigation, data flow)\n\n---\n\n## 12. KEY ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS\n\n### **State Management**:\n- Redux with Redux Toolkit (createSlice, createAsyncThunk)\n- App-specific slices compose shared auth\n- Async operations via thunks that fetch from Netlify functions\n- Local component state for UI (modals, tabs, search)\n\n### **Component Organization**:\n- Page components coordinate data fetching and tab management\n- Smaller components (Card, Header) handle display and interaction\n- Modals are stateful (controlled by parent via `show` state + `onClose`)\n- Shared components (@shared) provide reusable UI building blocks\n\n### **Form Handling**:\n- Controlled inputs (value from state, onChange updates state)\n- Local state for form fields\n- Async submission with thunks\n- Validation via boolean state (isBalanced, isFormValid)\n- Disabled submit button during submission\n\n### **Styling**:\n- CSS-in-files (no styled-components, no Tailwind)\n- CSS variables for theming\n- BEM-lite naming convention\n- Reusable utility classes\n\n### **Navigation**:\n- React Router with BrowserRouter\n- Navigate component for redirects\n- useNavigate hook for programmatic navigation\n- Location awareness for active link styling\n\n### **Data Flow**:\n1. Component mounts → useEffect → dispatch async thunk\n2. Thunk fetches from `/.netlify/functions/{endpoint}`\n3. Redux state updates → component re-renders\n4. User interaction → dispatch new thunk or local state change\n5. Modal shows → user fills form → submit → dispatch thunk → fetch → close\n\n---\n\n## 13. IMPORTANT DETAILS FOR NEW FEATURES\n\n### **How Forms Validate**:\n- NewTransactionModal: Real-time balance calculation\n- Submit disabled until all required fields valid\n- Numeric tolerances: `Math.abs(debits - credits) < 0.005`\n\n### **How Modals Open**:\n- Parent component has `show` state\n- Button/action sets `setShow(true)`\n- Modal component exists when `show === true`\n- Modal calls `onClose` to set parent `show` to `false`\n- Overlay click also triggers `onClose`\n\n### **How Search Works** (AccountDetailPage):\n- Local `searchQuery` state\n- Transactions filtered: `description.toLowerCase().includes(q)`\n- Clear button resets to empty string\n\n### **How Categories Work**:\n- AccountsPage defines CATEGORY_ORDER with default expanded states\n- Assets/Liabilities default expanded, others collapsed\n- Groups accounts by category, calculates totals\n- Uses shared CategoryGroup component\n\n### **How Breadcrumbs Work**:\n- Labels mapped from route first segment\n- Created in NavBar's AccountingBreadcrumb subcomponent\n- Shows \"Home\" + current page label\n\n---\n\n## 14. API/DATABASE EXPECTATIONS\n\n### **Expected Numeric Field Handling**:\nThe accounts endpoint parses these fields from strings to numbers:\n- balance, budget_amount, budget_actual\n- interest_rate, credit_limit, monthly_payment\n- savings_goal_target, savings_goal_current\n- performance_pct, debits_ytd, credits_ytd\n\n### **Transaction Data Model**:\n- Transactions have multiple entries (one per affected account)\n- Each entry: account_id, entry_type (debit/credit), amount\n- Must balance (sum of debits = sum of credits)\n- Optional tags array\n\n### **Report Data Model**:\n- Report itself: metadata (name, type, date range, filters)\n- ReportItem: hierarchical (account/category/item) with budget vs actual\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive guide covers the full architecture, component patterns, state management approach, styling strategy, and implementation details of the Accounting app. The modal/form patterns, Redux structure, and CSS approach are all well-established and ready for extending with new features like the advanced modals mentioned in your previous context."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a3e0626e5ae0b13b6 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 75370\ntool_uses: 50\nduration_ms: 100166</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a386feae-cbfc-44e6-a579-1717c33a84af","uuid":"22e0f876-9148-4126-a48e-2690128e57a5","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the Accounting app at /repo/apps/Accounting.

NETLIFY BACKEND ENDPOINTS\n\n### **accounts.ts** (`netlify/functions/accounts.ts`)\n**Uses**: Neon database with serverless PostgreSQL\n\n**Endpoints**:\n- `GET /.netlify/functions/accounts` → Returns all accounts (ordered by category, name)\n- `GET /.netlify/functions/accounts/{id}` → Returns single account\n- `DELETE /.netlify/functions/accounts/{id}` → Deletes account\n\n**Numeric Field Parsing**: Auto-converts string numeric fields from DB:\n```\nbalance, budget_amount, budget_actual, interest_rate, credit_limit,\nmonthly_payment, savings_goal_target, savings_goal_current,\nperformance_pct, debits_ytd, credits_ytd\n```\n\n**Pattern**: Follows REST conventions, returns JSON, status codes (200, 404, 405, 500)\n\n---\n\n## 7. CSS/STYLING APPROACH\n\n### **Architecture**:\n1. **Tokens** (`@shared/styles/tokens.css`) - CSS variables for:\n   - Colors (backgrounds, text, accents, status colors)\n   - Shadows\n   - Typography\n   - Sizing\n\n2. **Common Styles** (`@shared/styles/common.css`) - Reusable classes:\n   - `.form-group`, `.form-label`, `.form-input`, `.form-select`\n   - `.btn`, `.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--ghost`, `.btn--danger`\n   - `.data-table` with th, td, hover effects\n   - `.badge`, `.badge--complete`, `.badge--pending`\n   - `.searchable-select` with dropdown\n\n3. **Layout** (`@shared/styles/layout.css`) - Page structure, responsive utilities\n\n4. **App-Specific** (`src/index.css`) - 900+ lines including:\n   - NavBar styles\n   - Account card styles\n   - Modal styles\n   - Form elements\n   - Budget progress bars\n   - Tabs\n\n### **Key CSS Classes**:\n\n**Modal Structure**:\n```css\n.modal-overlay { /* fixed, full-screen, semi-transparent backdrop */ }\n.modal-content { /* centered box, 90% width, max 720px */ }\n.modal-header { /* flex, space-between */ }\n.modal-title { /* 18px, 600 weight */ }\n.modal-close-btn { /* 28x28, transparent bg, hover bg change */ }\n.modal-footer { /* flex, justify-end, gap 8px */ }\n.form-group { /* flex column, gap 4px, margin-bottom 16px */ }\n.form-label { /* 12px, 500 weight, muted color */ }\n.form-input { /* 36px height, padding, border, focus ring */ }\n```\n\n**Line Items Table**:\n```css\n.line-items-header,\n.line-item-row { \n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 120px 140px 36px;\n  /* Account | Type | Amount | Delete Button */\n}\n```\n\n**Budget Progress Bars**:\n```css\n.budget-bar-track { /* 6px height, light background */ }\n.budget-bar-fill { /* transitions width */ }\n.budget-bar-fill--warning { /* yellow/orange */ }\n.budget-bar-fill--over { /* red */ }\n```\n\n**Color Scheme**:\n- Primary accent: `--accent-primary: #4d7c5e` (green)\n- Success: `--status-success: #4d7c5e`\n- Warning: `--status-warning: #b08a3e` (amber)\n- Error: `--status-error: #b05050` (red)\n- Text primary: `#26231e` (dark brown)\n- Text secondary: `#37342e`\n- Text muted: `#69645a`\n- Background: `--bg-base-color: #faf9f7` (off-white)\n- Border: `--bg-border-color: #ddd9d3`\n\n**Transaction Direction Badges**:\n- Debit: `background: #f5e3e3; color: --status-error`\n- Credit: `background: #e6ede8; color: --status-success`\n\n---\n\n## 8. SHARED COMPONENTS (in `/repo/apps/shared`)\n\n### **SearchableSelect** (`components/SearchableSelect.tsx`)\n- Dropdown with search/filter\n- Used in NewTransactionModal for account selection\n- Props: `options`, `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `testId`\n- Behavior: Search on focus, blur hides dropdown, mousedown selects\n\n### **CategorySection** (`components/CategorySection.tsx`)\n- Collapsible category groups\n- Generic `<T>` for any item type\n- Shows header with chevron, title, total\n- Props: `title`, `items`, `defaultExpanded`, `total`, `renderItem`, `getItemKey`\n- Has both single CategorySection and CategoryGroup variants\n- Used on AccountsPage for Assets/Liabilities/etc.\n\n### **CategorySection.css** - Styling for sections:\n```css\n.category-section\n.category-section-header\n.category-section-chevron { /* rotates on expand */ }\n.category-section-title\n.category-section-total\n.category-section-content { /* grid layout */ }\n```\n\n### **Breadcrumb** (`components/Breadcrumb.tsx`)\n- Navigation trail\n- Used in NavBar and AccountDetailPage\n\n### **Other Shared Components**:\n- FilterSelect, ConfirmDialog, ImportDialog, TimelineSection, CommentsSection, DocumentsSection, Pagination\n\n### **Shared Auth** (`auth/authSlice.ts`)\n```typescript\ninterface AuthUser {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  email: string\n  avatarUrl?: string\n}\n\ninterface AuthState {\n  user: AuthUser | null\n  isAuthenticated: boolean\n  isLoading: boolean\n}\n\n// Reducers: setUser, clearUser, setLoading\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. FORM PATTERNS & VALIDATION\n\n### **NewTransactionModal Form Pattern**:\n1. **State Management**: Local state for all form fields\n2. **Validation**:\n   - Running calculations: `totalDebits`, `totalCredits`, `isBalanced`\n   - Balance check: `Math.abs(totalDebits - totalCredits) < 0.005`\n   - Submit button disabled if: `!description.trim() || !isBalanced || submitting`\n3. **Line Items**:\n   - Array state with add/remove/update functions\n   - Minimum 2 rows enforced\n   - Delete button disabled when <= 2 rows\n4. **Tags**:\n   - Array state\n   - Enter key adds new tag\n   - Click remove button deletes tag\n5. **Async Submission**:\n   - Sets submitting state\n   - Dispatches thunk, unwraps, then fetches fresh accounts\n   - Calls onClose on success\n   - Doesn't reset submitting on error (lets modal close naturally)\n\n### **CreateReportDialog Form Pattern**:\n1. **Controlled Inputs**: All form fields have onChange handlers\n2. **Type Selection**: Button group (not radio), toggles state\n3. **Date Validation**: Both dates required for submit\n4. **Submission**: Same async pattern with unwrap\n\n---\n\n## 10. MODAL/DIALOG IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### **Structure Pattern**:\n```tsx\n<div className=\"modal-overlay\" onClick={onClose}>\n  <div className=\"modal-content\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n    <div className=\"modal-header\">\n      <h2 className=\"modal-title\">Title</h2>\n      <button className=\"modal-close-btn\" onClick={onClose}>✕</button>\n    </div>\n    \n    {/* Form content */}\n    \n    <div className=\"modal-footer\">\n      <button className=\"btn btn--secondary\" onClick={onClose}>Cancel</button>\n      <button className=\"btn btn--primary\" onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={...}>\n        Save\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### **Z-index**: `.modal-overlay` has `z-index: 1000`\n\n### **Styling**:\n- Overlay: `position: fixed; inset: 0; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`\n- Content: `max-width: 720px; width: 90%; max-height: 90vh; overflow-y: auto`\n- Always centered with flexbox\n\n---\n\n## 11. TEST SPECIFICATION (`docs/tests.md`)\n\nThe tests.md file (1245 lines) covers:\n\n### **Components Tested**:\n- NavBar: Logo, navigation, active states, new transaction modal\n- AccountsOverviewHeader: Title, generate reports button\n- CategorySection: Display, expand/collapse, totals, default states\n- AccountCard: Name/balance display, menu actions, budget bars, performance, savings goals\n- TransactionsTab: Table layout, sorting, direction badges, view/edit actions\n- BudgetDetailsTab: Budget items, progress bars\n\n### **Pages Tested**:\n- AccountsPage: Category display, account cards, navigation\n- AccountDetailPage: Header, search, tabs, budget overview\n- ReportListPage: (stubs)\n- ReportDetailsPage: (stubs)\n\n### **Dialog Tests**:\n- NewTransactionModal: Line items, validation, balance indicator, submission\n- CreateReportDialog: Form fields, type selection, date validation\n\n### **Key Test Patterns**:\n- Initial state → User action → Expected result\n- Visual verification (colors, text, structure)\n- Interaction verification (clicks, state changes)\n- Integration verification (navigation, data flow)\n\n---\n\n## 12. KEY ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS\n\n### **State Management**:\n- Redux with Redux Toolkit (createSlice, createAsyncThunk)\n- App-specific slices compose shared auth\n- Async operations via thunks that fetch from Netlify functions\n- Local component state for UI (modals, tabs, search)\n\n### **Component Organization**:\n- Page components coordinate data fetching and tab management\n- Smaller components (Card, Header) handle display and interaction\n- Modals are stateful (controlled by parent via `show` state + `onClose`)\n- Shared components (@shared) provide reusable UI building blocks\n\n### **Form Handling**:\n- Controlled inputs (value from state, onChange updates state)\n- Local state for form fields\n- Async submission with thunks\n- Validation via boolean state (isBalanced, isFormValid)\n- Disabled submit button during submission\n\n### **Styling**:\n- CSS-in-files (no styled-components, no Tailwind)\n- CSS variables for theming\n- BEM-lite naming convention\n- Reusable utility classes\n\n### **Navigation**:\n- React Router with BrowserRouter\n- Navigate component for redirects\n- useNavigate hook for programmatic navigation\n- Location awareness for active link styling\n\n### **Data Flow**:\n1. Component mounts → useEffect → dispatch async thunk\n2. Thunk fetches from `/.netlify/functions/{endpoint}`\n3. Redux state updates → component re-renders\n4. User interaction → dispatch new thunk or local state change\n5. Modal shows → user fills form → submit → dispatch thunk → fetch → close\n\n---\n\n## 13. IMPORTANT DETAILS FOR NEW FEATURES\n\n### **How Forms Validate**:\n- NewTransactionModal: Real-time balance calculation\n- Submit disabled until all required fields valid\n- Numeric tolerances: `Math.abs(debits - credits) < 0.005`\n\n### **How Modals Open**:\n- Parent component has `show` state\n- Button/action sets `setShow(true)`\n- Modal component exists when `show === true`\n- Modal calls `onClose` to set parent `show` to `false`\n- Overlay click also triggers `onClose`\n\n### **How Search Works** (AccountDetailPage):\n- Local `searchQuery` state\n- Transactions filtered: `description.toLowerCase().includes(q)`\n- Clear button resets to empty string\n\n### **How Categories Work**:\n- AccountsPage defines CATEGORY_ORDER with default expanded states\n- Assets/Liabilities default expanded, others collapsed\n- Groups accounts by category, calculates totals\n- Uses shared CategoryGroup component\n\n### **How Breadcrumbs Work**:\n- Labels mapped from route first segment\n- Created in NavBar's AccountingBreadcrumb subcomponent\n- Shows \"Home\" + current page label\n\n---\n\n## 14. API/DATABASE EXPECTATIONS\n\n### **Expected Numeric Field Handling**:\nThe accounts endpoint parses these fields from strings to numbers:\n- balance, budget_amount, budget_actual\n- interest_rate, credit_limit, monthly_payment\n- savings_goal_target, savings_goal_current\n- performance_pct, debits_ytd, credits_ytd\n\n### **Transaction Data Model**:\n- Transactions have multiple entries (one per affected account)\n- Each entry: account_id, entry_type (debit/credit), amount\n- Must balance (sum of debits = sum of credits)\n- Optional tags array\n\n### **Report Data Model**:\n- Report itself: metadata (name, type, date range, filters)\n- ReportItem: hierarchical (account/category/item) with budget vs actual\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive guide covers the full architecture, component patterns, state management approach, styling strategy, and implementation details of the Accounting app. The modal/form patterns, Redux structure, and CSS approach are all well-established and ready for extending with new features like the advanced modals mentioned in your previous context."}],"totalDurationMs":100166,"totalTokens":75370,"totalToolUseCount":50,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2357,"cache_read_input_tokens":65867,"output_tokens":7145,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2357},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a386feae-cbfc-44e6-a579-1717c33a84af","uuid":"dc8aeeb0-a96c-4703-a821-f5f942667287","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-size: 14px;\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex / Value         |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —                   |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.05)` | ~5% warm black     |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(234, 231, 226)`     | `#eae7e2`          |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(242, 240, 236)`     | `#f2f0ec`          |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(230, 237, 232)`     | `#e6ede8`          |\n\nSelected row uses a very faint green tint to reinforce the accent color without being loud.\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: 4px;\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px 8px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(55, 52, 46);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background           | Description                  |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| Default | transparent          | No background                |\n| Hover   | rgb(235, 233, 228)   | `#ebe9e4` — warm subtle gray |\n| Active  | rgb(226, 224, 218)   | `#e2e0da` — slightly deeper  |\n\n### Active Nav Item (current page)\n\n```css\nbackground: rgb(226, 234, 229);  /* very faint green tint */\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#ddd9d3` — a warm gray rather than cool.\nHover border darkens to approximately `#c5c0b8`.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value | Usage                     |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| 4px   | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px   | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px   | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%   | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                    |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.15) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows use a warm-tinted black rather than pure black, keeping the overall palette cohesive.\n\n---\n\n## Transitions\n\n| Property         | Duration | Easing   | Usage                    |\n|------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|\n| background-color | 0.1s     | ease     | Fast hover interactions  |\n| opacity          | 0.2s     | ease-out | Standard fade-in/out     |\n| color            | 0.15s    | ease     | Text color shifts        |\n| fill             | 0.4s     | ease     | Icon color transitions   |\n\n---\n\n## CSS Custom Properties\n\n### Backgrounds & Colors\n`--bg-color`, `--bg-sidebar-color`, `--bg-base-color`, `--bg-border-color`, `--content-color-light`, `--content-highlight-color-light`\n\n### Interactive States\n`--normal-bg`, `--normal-border`, `--normal-border-hover`, `--normal-text`\n\n### Accent\n`--accent-primary: #4d7c5e`, `--accent-light: #5a8f6a`, `--accent-dark: #3e694e`, `--accent-muted: #6b8f7a`, `--accent-subtle-bg: #e6ede8`\n\n### Sizing\n`--sidebar-width` (240px), `--scrollbar-width` (12px), `--control-border-radius` (4px)\n\n---\n\n## Status Colors\n\nFor data-driven UIs that need status indicators (e.g., pipeline stages, priority levels):\n\n| Status     | Color     | Hex       | Notes                     |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Success    | Forest    | `#4d7c5e` | Matches primary accent    |\n| Warning    | Amber     | `#b08a3e` | Warm gold, not bright yellow |\n| Error      | Brick     | `#b05050` | Muted red, not alarming   |\n| Info       | Slate     | `#5a7a8a` | Cool blue-gray            |\n| Neutral    | Stone     | `#8a8580` | Warm gray                 |\n\nAll status colors are desaturated to fit the subdued palette. Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

The existing NewTransactionModal already works but is a monolithic component. The tests spec defines 4 sub-components:\n\n1. **TransactionHeaderFields** - Date, Description, Currency fields in a single row\n2. **LineItemsTable** - The line items with Account/Type/Amount columns\n3. **BalanceIndicator** - Shows totals and balanced/unbalanced status\n4. **TagsInput** - Tag input with chips\n\nLooking at the test specs more carefully:\n\nFor **TransactionHeaderFields**:\n- Date field with calendar icon\n- Description input with placeholder \"Enter transaction description...\"\n\n\n- Currency dropdown with default \"USD ($)\" and options EUR (€), GBP (£), JPY (¥), all three in a single horizontal row with Description taking up the most space\n\nFor **LineItemsTable**:\n- Heading \"Transaction Details (Line Items)\" with column headers for Account, Type, Amount, and a delete column\n- Account dropdown displays accounts with their codes like \"Checking Account (1010)\" with \"Select Account\" as placeholder\n- Type dropdown (not a toggle) offering Credit and Debit options, defaulting to Debit\n- Amount input for numeric values and a trash icon delete button\n- \"+ Add Line Item\" button to add new rows, starting with one initial row\n\nFor **BalanceIndicator**:\n- Displays \"Total Debits:\" and \"Total Credits:\" with their amounts\n- Shows \"Transaction is Balanced\" with a green checkmark when debits equal credits, or \"Transaction is Unbalanced\" with a red icon otherwise\n- Blocks saving when the transaction is unbalanced\n\nFor **TagsInput**:\n- Label reads \"Tags / Categories\" with an \"(optional)\" note\n- Tags appear as removable chips with an × button\n- Users can type and press Enter or comma to add tags, supporting multiple entries\n\nNow I need to refactor the modal into separate components. The Currency dropdown needs to be extracted into TransactionHeaderFields since it's currently just a state variable but should be an actual dropdown control. The LineItemsTable needs its own component with the Type field changed from a toggle to a proper dropdown.\n\nI'm also checking the mockup to verify the layout—Date, Description, and Currency should sit in a single row, and the line items section should be labeled \"Transaction Details (Line Items)\".\n\nNow I'm reviewing the existing CSS to see what's already in place for modals, tags, and the line items grid, then I'll add styles for the header row layout and currency dropdown while updating the balance indicator text.\n\nFor the implementation, I'm planning two main components: TransactionHeaderFields to handle the date, description, and currency inputs in a three-column layout, and LineItemsTable to manage the line items with proper dropdowns for account and type selection, along with add and delete functionality.\n\nI also need a BalanceIndicator to display the debit/credit totals and balance status, a TagsInput component for optional categorization with chip-based tag management, and finally a NewTransactionModal that orchestrates everything together with full state management and form submission.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the edit mode requires an updateTransaction thunk since the tests expect to update existing transactions rather than create duplicates.

Let me now implement the components. Let me trace through the test specs again and make a plan:\n\n1. **TransactionHeaderFields**: Date, Description, Currency in a single row. Currency needs a dropdown (not just text). Test says \"Select Account\" placeholder should be used for accounts, and Currency should default to \"USD ($)\" with dropdown options. I need CSS for the row layout.\n\n2. **LineItemsTable**: Section heading \"Transaction Details (Line Items)\". Account dropdown shows accounts with codes (e.g., \"Checking Account (1010)\"). Type is a dropdown (not a toggle) with \"Credit\" and \"Debit\". Amount accepts numeric values. \n\nThe line items section also needs a delete button with a trash icon for each row, an \"Add Line Item\" button, and should start with two empty rows by default.\n\n3. **BalanceIndicator**: Shows \"Total Debits:\" and \"Total Credits:\" with formatted amounts. \"Transaction is Balanced\" (green checkmark) or \"Transaction is Unbalanced\" (red icon).\n\n4. **TagsInput**: Label \"Tags / Categories\" with \"(optional)\". Tag chips with × remove buttons. Input to type and press Enter/comma to add.\n\n5. **NewTransactionModal**: Orchestrates all, supports edit mode with pre-populated fields.\n\nI should also check if there's an `updateTransaction` endpoint or if I need to add one.\n\nLooking at the transactionsSlice, it references `/.netlify/functions/transactions`, which means there should be a transactions function file, but I only see accounts.ts in the functions directory. The transactions endpoint might not exist yet, or it could be handled elsewhere. Rather than getting stuck on the backend, I'll focus on building the frontend components since the thunks are already defined in the slice—if the backend isn't ready, that's a separate concern. Let me move forward with creating the components.\n\nI need to add an `updateTransaction` thunk to the transactionsSlice for edit mode support, then build out the component structure. I'm planning to create the header fields component, line items table, balance indicator, tags input, and update the modal itself. I'll also need to add the corresponding styles and set up the state management for the new transaction form.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the specific requirements for each component—the header needs date, description, and currency fields in a single row, the line items table requires account dropdowns with codes and a proper type dropdown instead of a toggle, and I need to verify what other components like the balance indicator and tags input should display. I should use SearchableSelect for the Type field with just Credit and Debit options to match the test requirements. For the Account dropdown, I need to format the labels to include the account code in parentheses like \"Checking Account (1010)\". The currency dropdown can also use SearchableSelect with the available currency options.\n\nNow I'm building the TransactionHeaderFields component... Writing component markup...\n\nI'm noticing the test expects a chevron icon on the currency dropdown, but the SearchableSelect component doesn't include that visual indicator. I could build a custom dropdown specifically for currency, though the SearchableSelect already handles the dropdown functionality and styling. Let me stick with SearchableSelect since it meets the requirement of using a custom component rather than native HTML select elements, even if the chevron detail differs from the test description.\n\nFor the Type field in the line items table, the test expects a dropdown with just \"Credit\" and \"Debit\" options. Using SearchableSelect for only two options feels a bit heavy with the search input, but it will still work fine and satisfy the dropdown requirement. I'll use it consistently across both dropdowns.\n\nBuilding the LineItemsTable component now... Writing the component JSX... Writing the line item row component... Writing the delete button and balance indicator component... Writing the balance status indicator... I'm building out the tags input component with a container that displays existing tags with remove buttons, and an input field that accepts new tags when the user presses Enter or comma.\n\nNow I'm setting up the NewTransactionModal component, importing the necessary hooks and slices to manage transaction creation and updates, along with the sub-components for handling transaction details, line items, balance tracking, and tags.\n\nSetting up state for the transaction form... Writing form logic... Building the modal UI... Finishing up the component with cancel and save buttons, then I need to add the `updateTransaction` action to the slice and create the CSS styles for the transaction header fields. I need to add an `updateTransaction` thunk to handle editing existing transactions, since the test specs require updating records without duplication. The backend likely has a PUT endpoint at `/.netlify/functions/transactions/{id}` similar to how `createTransaction` POSTs to the transactions function.\n\nRather than getting blocked on whether the backend exists yet, I'll implement the frontend thunk and assume the endpoint will be ready. I should also check how the modal gets opened in edit mode from the TransactionsTab's \"View/Edit\" button to understand what props need to be passed.\n\nActually, let me focus on what I'm actually tasked with building: the four components and the modal itself. I can make the modal support edit mode through props, and whoever integrates it later can wire up the existing pages. Looking at the test requirements, the line items table needs four columns—Account, Type, Amount, and a delete button column—and the header fields should capture Date and Description.\n\nLet me start
