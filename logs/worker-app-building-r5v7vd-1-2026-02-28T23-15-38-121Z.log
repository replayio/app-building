Only fall\n    62→back to raw CSS media queries in `index.css` when Tailwind utilities cannot express the rule\n    63→(e.g., hiding table columns rendered from mapped data, or switching `<tr>` display modes).\n    64→\n    65→**Do not mix min-width and max-width variants.** Use `max-*:` variants consistently so styles\n    66→degrade from desktop down:\n    67→- `max-lg:` — max-width 1024px\n    68→- `max-md:` — max-width 768px\n    69→- `max-sm:` — max-width 640px\n    70→\n    71→When raw CSS is needed (e.g., table column hiding via nth-child or tag selectors), use `@media\n    72→(max-width: ...)` at 1024px, 768px, and 480px. The 480px CSS breakpoint covers the gap below\n    73→Tailwind's 640px `max-sm:`.\n    74→\n    75→Do not use JavaScript-based layout switching. Do not add a hamburger menu or mobile navigation\n    76→unless the app already has one — the sidebar stays fixed.\n    77→\n    78→### Layout adjustments\n    79→\n    80→Apply these patterns at the Tailwind breakpoints:\n    81→\n    82→- **Page padding**: `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the outermost page wrapper.\n    83→- **Multi-column grids** (detail page bodies, metadata grids): start with the desktop column\n    84→  count and collapse at each breakpoint.\n    85→  - Two-column body: `grid grid-cols-2 max-md:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n    86→  - Four-column metadata: `grid grid-cols-4 max-md:grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n    87→- **Section card padding**: `p-4 max-sm:p-3` or `px-5 max-sm:px-3`.\n    88→- **Form layouts** with side-by-side fields: `grid grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`.\n    89→- **Typography scaling**: reduce heading sizes at `max-sm:`.\n    90→  - Page titles: `text-[24px] max-sm:text-[20px]`\n    91→  - Detail headings: `text-[18px] max-sm:text-[16px]`\n    92→- **Button text**: on narrow viewports, hide button labels and keep only icons:\n    93→  `<span className=\"max-sm:hidden\">Label</span>`\n    94→- **Horizontal button rows** and action bars: use `flex-wrap` so they wrap naturally.\n    95→- **Modals and dialogs**: constrain with `max-sm:max-w-[calc(100%-24px)]` and ensure\n    96→  `overflow-y-auto` for tall content.\n    97→\n    98→### Data density in lists and tables\n    99→\n   100→Lists and tables are the most important thing to get right. On wide viewports they can show many\n   101→columns, but on narrow viewports they must progressively hide less-important columns.\n   102→\n   103→- Identify which columns are essential (e.g., name, status) vs secondary (e.g., created date,\n   104→  assigned user, tags).\n   105→- **Column hiding**: Use Tailwind `max-lg:hidden` and `max-md:hidden` directly on `<th>`/`<td>`\n   106→  elements when the table is rendered with explicit column elements.

Before unpacking subtasks, read `docs/plan.md` (create it\nif it doesn't exist) and check which stages have already been completed.\n\nThe format is:\n\n```markdown\n## Polish\n\n### Responsive UI\n- [x] ClientsListPage\n- [x] ClientDetailPage\n- [ ] DealsListPage\n```\n\nWhen a polish stage is fully complete, mark it done:\n\n```markdown\n### Responsive UI ✓\n```\n\nA stage with `✓` in its heading is skipped during unpacking — no tasks are added for it.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nRead `docs/plan.md` and check which polish stages still need work. For each incomplete stage,\nadd the appropriate tasks as described below. After adding tasks, update `docs/plan.md` with\nthe planned items (unchecked). As each subtask completes, check off its entry.\n\n### Responsive UI\n\nIf the `Responsive UI` section in `docs/plan.md` is missing or not marked `✓`, the app needs\nresponsive work. Read `docs/tests.md` to identify all pages, then add one task per page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/maintain/polishApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"MakeResponsive<PageName>: Make <PageName> responsive\"\n```\n\nAdd or update the `Responsive UI` section in `docs/plan.md` with an unchecked entry for each page.\n\n## Making a Page Responsive\n\nWhen working on a `MakeResponsive` subtask, update the page and its components so the layout adapts\ncleanly as the viewport shrinks from desktop down to mobile widths. The goal is that all content\nremains usable and readable — no horizontal scrolling, no overlapping elements, no truncated\ncontrols.\n\nAfter completing the work, check off the page in `docs/plan.md`. If all pages are done, mark the\nsection heading with `✓`.\n\n### Implementation approach\n\nUse **Tailwind responsive utility classes** (max-width variants) as the primary tool. Only fall\nback to raw CSS media queries in `index.css` when Tailwind utilities cannot express the rule\n(e.g., hiding table columns rendered from mapped data, or switching `<tr>` display modes).\n\n**Do not mix min-width and max-width variants.** Use `max-*:` variants consistently so styles\ndegrade from desktop down:\n- `max-lg:` — max-width 1024px\n- `max-md:` — max-width 768px\n- `max-sm:` — max-width 640px\n\nWhen raw CSS is needed (e.g., table column hiding via nth-child or tag selectors), use `@media\n(max-width: ...)` at 1024px, 768px, and 480px. The 480px CSS breakpoint covers the gap below\nTailwind's 640px `max-sm:`.\n\nDo not use JavaScript-based layout switching. Do not add a hamburger menu or mobile navigation\nunless the app already has one — the sidebar stays fixed.\n\n### Layout adjustments\n\nApply these patterns at the Tailwind breakpoints:\n\n- **Page padding**: `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the outermost page wrapper.\n- **Multi-column grids** (detail page bodies, metadata grids): start with the desktop column\n  count and collapse at each breakpoint.\n  - Two-column body: `grid grid-cols-2 max-md:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n  - Four-column metadata: `grid grid-cols-4 max-md:grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n- **Section card padding**: `p-4 max-sm:p-3` or `px-5 max-sm:px-3`.\n- **Form layouts** with side-by-side fields: `grid grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`.\n- **Typography scaling**: reduce heading sizes at `max-sm:`.\n  - Page titles: `text-[24px] max-sm:text-[20px]`\n  - Detail headings: `text-[18px] max-sm:text-[16px]`\n- **Button text**: on narrow viewports, hide button labels and keep only icons:\n  `<span className=\"max-sm:hidden\">Label</span>`\n- **Horizontal button rows** and action bars: use `flex-wrap` so they wrap naturally.\n- **Modals and dialogs**: constrain with `max-sm:max-w-[calc(100%-24px)]` and ensure\n  `overflow-y-auto` for tall content.\n\n### Data density in lists and tables\n\nLists and tables are the most important thing to get right. On wide viewports they can show many\ncolumns, but on narrow viewports they must progressively hide less-important columns.\n\n- Identify which columns are essential (e.g., name, status) vs secondary (e.g., created date,\n  assigned user, tags).\n- **Column hiding**: Use Tailwind `max-lg:hidden` and `max-md:hidden` directly on `<th>`/`<td>`\n  elements when the table is rendered with explicit column elements. When columns are generated\n  from mapped data or use CSS Grid, define named classes in `index.css` with `@media` rules.\n- **Card mode at narrowest viewport**: At 480px (via `@media` in `index.css`), hide the table\n  header and switch rows to `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap` so each row reads as a card with\n  key fields only.\n- Ensure sort/filter controls remain accessible — use `flex-wrap` on filter bars so controls\n  wrap naturally on narrow viewports.\n\n### Card-based lists\n\nWhen the page uses cards instead of a table (e.g., task lists), adjust information density within\neach card at breakpoints:\n\n- At `max-lg:` hide secondary metadata (avatars, role text).\n- At `max-md:` relocate metadata that was in a side column to an inline row below the title\n  using `hidden max-md:flex`.\n- At `max-sm:` consolidate remaining metadata into a single compact row using\n  `hidden max-sm:flex`.\n","numLines":124,"startLine":1,"totalLines":124}}}

Add tasks for: Status page refresh flashing issue fix, and add a step to polishing strategy to make sure refresh logic avoids problems like this.\n\nLet me look at the apps to understand which app has a status page, and look at the existing structure more carefully.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4784,"cache_read_input_tokens":27300,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4784,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"666ff7d9-f28f-415a-80bd-a147548d3a7c","uuid":"3cde57bf-3255-4d10-840e-38f94c169331"}

MainPage (/)\n     7→   Description: Main landing page for the autonomous app builder. Layout: at the top, there is a selector (e.g., tabs, dropdown, or segmented control) that filters which apps to show with three options: (1) apps currently being built, (2) apps that have recently been finished, and (3) apps that have been queued but not started yet. Directly below this selector, there is a prominent 'Request an app' call-to-action (CTA) button or section that navigates the user to the RequestPage. The main content area displays a list or grid of app cards. Each app card shows the app’s title and a short description, and each card links to that app’s dedicated AppPage. The page should support updating the visible list according to the selected filter, showing only apps in the corresponding state (in progress, recently finished, or queued).\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdqvIroDiRZOVD8n3oL79Tegv1adIFGkcmQ6HA\n     9→\n    10→2.

If a completed app is available, the page includes a clear link or button to access or open the completed app (e.g., a URL to the deployed app or a download link). Below the main info section, there is a chronological feed or activity log showing the AI output while developing the app (e.g., status updates, logs, intermediate reasoning or steps). For in-progress apps, this feed is actively updated in real time or via periodic refresh, so the user can watch the development process as it happens. For completed or queued apps, the feed shows the historical development output or indicates that development has not yet started, respectively.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdR5c80FCuTrISNsDvKXJtHUEOBkned31bC8VP\n    13→\n    14→3. RequestPage (/request)\n    15→   Description: A multi-step wizard where the user can request a new app. Step 1: the user describes the app they are looking for, likely via a text input or form with fields capturing requirements and details. After submission, the system assesses whether the request fits policy and technical requirements (e.g., no personal information, disallowed content, or other restricted criteria). Based on this assessment, the wizard either (a) rejects the request, displaying a clear rejection message and a reason for rejection, or (b) accepts the request, queues the app for autonomous building, and then shows a confirmation screen with a link to the new app’s AppPage where the user can monitor its progress. The layout should guide the user step-by-step, indicate progress through the wizard, handle validation errors, and clearly communicate the outcome of the assessment.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kds5EP7hTtGH82bSwipudoBvMJrNqh1kgO3jVR\n    17→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_015eYrHhHqfswEYVC2VgPjhN","session_id":"666ff7d9-f28f-415a-80bd-a147548d3a7c","uuid":"16143ccc-7daf-4418-9e78-1f84174f7df8"}

What the App Does (AppSpec.md)\n\nThe LoopBuilder is an autonomous app-building platform with three pages:\n\n**MainPage (`/`):** A segmented control (tabs: \"Building\", \"Finished\", \"Queued\") at the top filters which app cards are shown. Below the filter is a \"Request an app\" CTA. App cards show title and description and link to the AppPage.\n\n**AppPage (`/apps/:id`):** Shows title, description, status badge, metadata (created date, model, deployment), action buttons (Open Live App, Download Source Code), and a live/historical activity log feed showing AI development output — auto-updating for in-progress apps.\n\n**RequestPage (`/request`):** A multi-step wizard: (1) describe the app, (2) assessment against policy criteria, (3) confirmation with either rejection (with reason + edit button) or acceptance (with a link to the new app's AppPage).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Status Page — All Related Files\n\n**Route:** `/status` (defined in `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/App.tsx`, line 13)\n\nThe Status Page is an internal/admin page not described in the AppSpec — it was added as a system monitoring tool.

Let me understand what the user wants:\n\n1. **Webhook help button on status page**: Add a button that shows the different webhooks (app-builder-event, spawn-container, set-default-prompt) and how to call them. Also update testSpec.md directives to require this for all apps that receive webhooks.\n\n2. **Fix status page refresh flashing**: The status page refreshes every 10 seconds but the screen flashes. Fix this and add a step to polishing strategy to make sure refresh logic avoids this.\n\nThe user is asking me to \"add tasks\" to do these things. \n\nLooking at AGENTS.md, I need to use add-task.ts to queue these properly. For the webhook help button, I'll need to use the writeApp.md skill to modify the status page component and add the dialog, then update testSpec.md directives separately. For the refresh flashing issue, that's a bug fix that also goes through writeApp.md to adjust the refresh logic and then update the polishing strategy documentation. the webhook help button feature - this needs app code changes and test updates. For the flash fix, I need to update the polish strategy and potentially the tests. Looking at this more carefully, some of these are skill document updates that could be done directly, while others are app-specific tasks that should go through the task system. Let me focus on what the user actually asked for - they want me to add tasks, not do the work myself. I'm realizing the skill document updates aren't app-specific code changes, so I should handle them separately from the app tasks. Let me map these to the right skills: the webhook help button and flash fix are app maintenance tasks, while the testSpec and polishApp updates are skill document edits I can make directly or queue as separate tasks depending on priority. I'm going back and forth on whether to make the skill document changes directly or queue them as tasks. Since the user explicitly asked to \"add tasks,\" I should probably create tasks for everything and let the worker handle it consistently. For the skill document updates, I can use writeScript.md as the appropriate skill, and for the app changes, I'll use the maintain skills.\n\nLet me just go ahead and create all four tasks properly.\n\nFor the webhook help button, I need to add a task that covers updating the status page UI with a help button, building out a modal that displays documentation for all three webhook types with their respective URLs, HTTP methods, authentication details, and payload schemas, plus the associated tests.\n\nFor the flash fix, I'll add a task about refining the refresh polling logic to eliminate unnecessary loading states on subsequent polls while keeping the initial load indicator visible.\n\nI'll structure this as three tasks: updating the documentation files directly, implementing the webhook help feature, and addressing the visual flashing during status updates.\n\nFor the webhook help button, I'm considering whether to use checkDirectives.md since we're establishing a new directive and ensuring compliance, or if writeApp.md would be more appropriate for a new feature. I think checkDirectives.md makes sense here since the directive comes first and then we're enforcing it in the app. The flash fix should go through fixBugReport.md since it's addressing a specific rendering issue.\n\nBoth tasks are related to the status page, so I'll structure them as maintenance work. For the webhook help button, I need to add test entries, implement the button and dialog, write playwright tests, and verify everything passes. The flash fix will require identifying the root cause of the refresh flashing and applying the appropriate fix.\n\nLet me check if there's already a bug report for the flash issue before proceeding. I'll then edit testSpec.md to add the webhook help directive and polishApp.md with refresh logic guidance, followed by creating the necessary tasks for the app code changes.\n\nLooking at the existing backend integrations directive, I can see it already covers webhooks and setup instructions. I should check if the webhook help button aligns with that directive or if I need to add something more specific to the status page context. I'm realizing the distinction here — the original directive was about outbound webhooks where users send data to external services, but what's needed is guidance for inbound webhooks where external services call the app. So I'm adding a new directive that requires apps receiving webhooks to expose clear documentation through the UI, listing each endpoint's URL path, HTTP method, authentication type, payload fields, and example requests, with tests verifying this documentation is accessible and accurate.\n\nFor polishApp.md, I need to add a section on refresh and polling behavior that prevents unnecessary loading states and visual flashing during subsequent data updates — keeping spinners only on initial load, merging new data without remounting components, and using stable React keys to avoid re-renders. details about unpacking subtasks and implementation. I should add \"Refresh Logic\" as another polish stage following the same pattern.\n\nLet me re-read polishApp.md more carefully to understand the structure...\n\nThe polishApp.md has:\n1. Progress Tracking section (using docs/plan.md)\n2. Unpack Subtasks section (how to create tasks)\n3. \"Responsive UI\" as the main polish stage\n\nI should add a new polish stage section. But unlike Responsive UI which is per-page, refresh logic checking would be per-page too (checking each page that does polling).\n\nNow I'm adding the Refresh Logic section with the command template for creating per-page tasks, then documenting the key principles for fixing refresh issues—making sure loading states only appear on initial fetches, updates merge into existing state rather than replacing it wholesale, and React keys stay stable based on data identifiers. I'm working through how to structure these tasks. The most straightforward approach is to add them directly: update the test specs with webhook help entries, implement the button itself, address the refresh flash issue, and run the tests to verify everything works. I could use the maintain skills to handle this—checkDirectives to catch the new requirement and queue fixes, then polishApp to smooth out the refresh

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":63,"oldLines":6,"newStart":63,"newLines":12,"lines":["   and any required configuration on the external side.

Only fall\nback to raw CSS media queries in `index.css` when Tailwind utilities cannot express the rule\n(e.g., hiding table columns rendered from mapped data, or switching `<tr>` display modes).\n\n**Do not mix min-width and max-width variants.** Use `max-*:` variants consistently so styles\ndegrade from desktop down:\n- `max-lg:` — max-width 1024px\n- `max-md:` — max-width 768px\n- `max-sm:` — max-width 640px\n\nWhen raw CSS is needed (e.g., table column hiding via nth-child or tag selectors), use `@media\n(max-width: ...)` at 1024px, 768px, and 480px. The 480px CSS breakpoint covers the gap below\nTailwind's 640px `max-sm:`.\n\nDo not use JavaScript-based layout switching. Do not add a hamburger menu or mobile navigation\nunless the app already has one — the sidebar stays fixed.\n\n### Layout adjustments\n\nApply these patterns at the Tailwind breakpoints:\n\n- **Page padding**: `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the outermost page wrapper.\n- **Multi-column grids** (detail page bodies, metadata grids): start with the desktop column\n  count and collapse at each breakpoint.\n  - Two-column body: `grid grid-cols-2 max-md:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n  - Four-column metadata: `grid grid-cols-4 max-md:grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n- **Section card padding**: `p-4 max-sm:p-3` or `px-5 max-sm:px-3`.\n- **Form layouts** with side-by-side fields: `grid grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`.\n- **Typography scaling**: reduce heading sizes at `max-sm:`.\n  - Page titles: `text-[24px] max-sm:text-[20px]`\n  - Detail headings: `text-[18px] max-sm:text-[16px]`\n- **Button text**: on narrow viewports, hide button labels and keep only icons:\n  `<span className=\"max-sm:hidden\">Label</span>`\n- **Horizontal button rows** and action bars: use `flex-wrap` so they wrap naturally.\n- **Modals and dialogs**: constrain with `max-sm:max-w-[calc(100%-24px)]` and ensure\n  `overflow-y-auto` for tall content.\n\n### Data density in lists and tables\n\nLists and tables are the most important thing to get right. On wide viewports they can show many\ncolumns, but on narrow viewports they must progressively hide less-important columns.\n\n- Identify which columns are essential (e.g., name, status) vs secondary (e.g., created date,\n  assigned user, tags).\n- **Column hiding**: Use Tailwind `max-lg:hidden` and `max-md:hidden` directly on `<th>`/`<td>`\n  elements when the table is rendered with explicit column elements. When columns are generated\n  from mapped data or use CSS Grid, define named classes in `index.css` with `@media` rules.\n- **Card mode at narrowest viewport**: At 480px (via `@media` in `index.css`), hide the table\n  header and switch rows to `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap` so each row reads as a card with\n  key fields only.\n- Ensure sort/filter controls remain accessible — use `flex-wrap` on filter bars so controls\n  wrap naturally on narrow viewports.\n\n### Card-based lists\n\nWhen the page uses cards instead of a table (e.g., task lists), adjust information density within\neach card at breakpoints:\n\n- At `max-lg:` hide secondary metadata (avatars, role text).\n- At `max-md:` relocate metadata that was in a side column to an inline row below the title\n  using `hidden max-md:flex`.\n- At `max-sm:` consolidate remaining metadata into a single compact row using\n  `hidden max-sm:flex`.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":121,"oldLines":3,"newStart":121,"newLines":36,"lines":["   using `hidden max-md:flex`."," - At `max-sm:` consolidate remaining metadata into a single compact row using","   `hidden max-sm:flex`.","+","+### Refresh Logic","+","+If the `Refresh Logic` section in `docs/plan.md` is missing or not marked `✓`, check for polling","+issues.
