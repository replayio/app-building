When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":113,"startLine":1,"totalLines":113}}}

Let me check what's going on. The procedure says to create a clean merge branch from main. But it seems like we're already on a merge branch. Let me check the git log to understand the state.\n\nLooking at the recent commits:\n\n\n- bfbef37 Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/sales-crm-2-review-5' into report-testFailures-sales-crm-2-review-5-20260224-164241-merge\n- 1cf0984 MergeSkills: report-testFailures-sales-crm-2-review-5-202...\n- cdac266 Report: report-testFailures-sales-crm-2-review-5-20260224-164241 — skill updates and report\n- 7166623 Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/sales-crm-2-review-5' into report-test\n\nI can see this branch has already been through multiple merge operations with the sales-crm-2-review-5 branch, so it looks like the merge work has already been started. I'm realizing this merge branch already exists from a previous attempt with prior commits. Since the task is asking me to redo it, I should start fresh by saving the current branch as my source, deleting the existing merge branch, and creating a clean one from origin/main to apply the changes properly. sales-crm-2-review-5-20260224-164241-merge`, which is actually the current branch I'm on. So this merge branch was already set up for this purpose and contains the skill changes and report. Let me examine the diff to see what's been done and what's left, then decide whether to start fresh by deleting this branch and recreating it from origin/main with the source changes applied, or just continue from here. The source branch appears to be `origin/sales-crm-2-review-5` based on the commit references, so I should verify the report file exists there before proceeding.\n\nActually, I think the simplest approach is to treat the current branch as my source and create a clean merge branch from scratch.","signature":"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
