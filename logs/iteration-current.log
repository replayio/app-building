Update these tests to reflect the\napp's new behavior. If you did not find any relevant tests, add at least one new test entry which checks\nthat the bug doesn't occur.\n\nFor any changes to the test spec you made, update the test files themselves to reflect those changes.\n\nAfter updating tests, make sure they pass. Read `strategies/tasks/build/testing.md` to understand how to run tests and debug failures.\n\n## Updating revisions\n\nIf the bug fix changed the app's behavior relative to the original `AppSpec.md` — for example,\nadding new functionality, removing a feature, or changing how something works — add an entry\nto `AppRevisions.md` (create the file next to `AppSpec.md` if it doesn't exist).\n\nEach entry should include the date, a reference to the bug report, and a concise description\nof what changed in the app's spec. This file is the authoritative record of how the app has\ndiverged from the original spec over time.\n\nIf the fix was purely a code bug that didn't change the intended behavior, skip this step.\n\n## Resolving bugs\n\nNow that the bug is fixed, move it from the top section of the file to an \"Unreviewed\" section lower down.\nLabel the bug with the git revision before / after the bug was fixed and tests updated.\n\nUpdate the section for the current round of maintenance in `docs/plan.md` with a note about the bug fix.\n\nCommit all changes and exit.\n","numLines":65,"startLine":1,"totalLines":65}}}

Add a Supabase-based auth system that authenticates against the same auth service used by `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/` (i.e. `https://auth.nut.new`). All app data stays in Neon via `DATABASE_URL`; the only new table is a `users` table in Neon for mapping auth identities to local user records.\n     6→\n     7→## Analysis\n     8→\n     9→### Current State\n    10→\n    11→- **No auth**: no login page, no session management, no token handling, no protected routes\n    12→- **10 unprotected Netlify functions** using the Netlify v2 pattern (`(req: Request) => Response`) with Neon via `@neondatabase/serverless`\n    13→- **Free-form author fields** that should use the authenticated user's name:\n    14→  - `task_notes.author` (default `'User'`)\n    15→  - `writeups.author` / `writeup_versions.author`\n    16→  - `timeline_events.user_name` (default `'System'`)\n    17→  - `contact_history.team_member`\n    18→  - `deal_history.changed_by`\n    19→\n    20→### How the Template Auth Works\n    21→\n    22→The template at `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/` authenticates against `https://auth.nut.new` (a Supabase instance). Key pieces:\n    23→\n    24→1. **Frontend** (`src/lib/auth.ts`): Creates a Supabase client using `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Patches `window.fetch` so every request to `/.netlify/functions/` automatically gets an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from the current Supabase session. This means existing frontend fetch calls need zero changes to start sending tokens.\n    25→\n    26→2. **Backend** (`netlify/utils/jwt.ts`): Verifies the JWT from the `Authorization` header against the JWKS at `https://auth.nut.new/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` using the `jose` library. On success, extracts user info from the JWT claims (`sub`, `email`, `user_metadata.full_name`, `app_metadata.provider`, `user_metadata.avatar_url`).\n    27→\n    28→3. **User sync**: The template syncs verified JWT claims to a `users` table via Supabase RPC. For the CRM, this should instead be a plain Neon SQL upsert into a `users` table in the existing Neon database.\n    29→\n    30→4. **Auth UI**: Login/Register pages using `@supabase/supabase-js` methods: `auth.signInWithPassword()`, `auth.signUp()`, `auth.signInWithOtp()`, `auth.resetPasswordForEmail()`. OAuth via redirect to `https://auth.nut.new/functions/v1/oauth/start`. Callback page at `/auth/callback` that extracts tokens from the URL hash.\n    31→\n    32→5. **React context** (`AuthProvider`): Exposes `useAuth()` with `{ isLoggedIn, user, loading, signOut, getUserId }`. Uses RTK Query to fetch session/user info.\n    33→\n    34→---\n    35→\n    36→## Implementation Plan\n    37→\n    38→### 1. Install Dependencies\n    39→\n    40→Add to `package.json` (check first which are already present):\n    41→\n    42→```\n    43→@supabase/supabase-js   — frontend Supabase auth client\n    44→jose                     — backend JWT verification\n    45→react-hook-form          — login/register forms\n    46→@hookform/resolvers      — zod resolver for react-hook-form\n    47→zod                      — form validation schemas\n    48→sonner                   — toast notifications for auth errors\n    49→```\n    50→\n    51→### 2. Environment Variables\n    52→\n    53→Only two new env vars are needed:\n    54→\n    55→```bash\n    56→VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL=https://auth.nut.new\n    57→VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inpia2NhdnhpZGp5c2xxbW5iZnV4Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDAwMDU0MjAsImV4cCI6MjA1NTU4MTQyMH0.xHKTareBFW0LW0AmYXH0vOvU3mLB3jkQGwhoNWqpnTw\n    58→```\n    59→\n    60→`DATABASE_URL` (Neon) stays the same. No Supabase service role key, no app ID, no auth-required flag needed.\n    61→\n    62→### 3. Add `users` Table to Neon\n    63→\n    64→Add to `scripts/init-db.ts`:\n    65→\n    66→```sql\n    67→CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n    68→  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n    69→  auth_user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    70→  email TEXT NOT NULL,\n    71→  name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    72→  provider TEXT DEFAULT 'unknown',\n    73→  avatar_url TEXT DEFAULT '',\n    74→  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),\n    75→  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n    76→);\n    77→```\n    78→\n    79→### 4. Frontend Auth Client\n    80→\n    81→Create `src/lib/auth.ts` based on the template's version. This file:\n    82→- Creates a Supabase client with `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`\n    83→- Overrides `window.fetch` to attach `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on all `/.netlify/functions/` calls\n    84→- Exports `auth` (the `supabase.auth` object)\n    85→\n    86→Reference: `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/src/lib/auth.ts`\n    87→\n    88→### 5. Backend Auth Middleware\n    89→\n    90→Create `netlify/utils/auth.ts` — a simplified version of the template's `jwt.ts`, adapted for Neon and the v2 handler pattern. It should:\n    91→\n    92→- At module load, fetch JWKS from `https://auth.nut.new/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` and build a key resolver using `jose`\n    93→- Export a `requiresAuth(handler)` wrapper that:\n    94→  1. Reads the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from the request\n    95→  2. Returns 401 if missing or invalid\n    96→  3. Verifies the JWT signature using the cached JWKS keys\n    97→  4. Extracts user info from the JWT payload: `sub` (auth_user_id), `email`, `user_metadata.full_name`, `app_metadata.provider`, `user_metadata.avatar_url`\n    98→  5. Upserts into the Neon `users` table using the existing `getDb()` / `neon()` pattern:\n    99→     ```sql\n   100→     INSERT INTO users (auth_user_id, email, name, provider, avatar_url)\n   101→     VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)\n   102→     ON CONFLICT (auth_user_id) DO UPDATE SET\n   103→       email = EXCLUDED.email, name = EXCLUDED.name,\n   104→       provider = EXCLUDED.provider, avatar_url = EXCLUDED.avatar_url,\n   105→       updated_at = NOW()\n   106→     RETURNING *\n   107→     ```\n   108→  6. Attaches the user record to the request (e.g. as a property or via a wrapper object) and calls the inner handler\n   109→- Keep the template's test-mode support (`IS_TEST` env var with a local test key) for Playwright tests\n   110→\n   111→**Key difference from template**: No Supabase service-role client on the backend at all. The user upsert is plain Neon SQL. No anonymous user fallback, no email allowlist, no app-ID check.\n   112→\n   113→Since the CRM uses the Netlify v2 handler pattern (`(req: Request) => Response`), the middleware should match that. A simple approach:\n   114→\n   115→```ts\n   116→interface AuthenticatedRequest extends Request {\n   117→  user: { id: string; auth_user_id: string; email: string; name: string; avatar_url: string; provider: string }\n   118→}\n   119→\n   120→export function requiresAuth(handler: (req: AuthenticatedRequest) => Promise<Response>) {\n   121→  return async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {\n   122→    // verify JWT, upsert user, attach to request, call handler\n   123→  }\n   124→}\n   125→```\n   126→\n   127→Reference: `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/netlify/utils/jwt.ts` (for JWKS fetching, JWT verification, and JWT claim extraction logic)\n   128→\n   129→### 6. Create `getUserInfo` Endpoint\n   130→\n   131→Create `netlify/functions/getUserInfo.ts`:\n   132→- Wrapped with `requiresAuth`\n   133→- Returns the authenticated user's `{ id, email, name, avatar_url }` as JSON\n   134→\n   135→### 7. Wrap Existing Netlify Functions\n   136→\n   137→Each of the 10 functions changes from:\n   138→\n   139→```ts\n   140→export default async function handler(req: Request) { ... }\n   141→```\n   142→\n   143→To:\n   144→\n   145→```ts\n   146→import { requiresAuth, type AuthenticatedRequest } from '../utils/auth'\n   147→\n   148→async function handlerImpl(req: AuthenticatedRequest) {\n   149→  // existing logic unchanged, plus req.user is now available\n   150→}\n   151→\n   152→export default requiresAuth(handlerImpl)\n   153→```\n   154→\n   155→For functions that write author/user fields, use `req.user.name` instead of hardcoded strings or request body values.\n   156→\n   157→### 8. RTK Query Base + Auth Slice\n   158→\n   159→Create `src/store/appApi.ts`:\n   160→\n   161→```ts\n   162→import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react\";\n   163→\n   164→export const appApi = createApi({\n   165→  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: \"/.netlify/functions/\" }),\n   166→  tagTypes: [\"Session\", \"UserInfo\"],\n   167→  endpoints: () => ({}),\n   168→});\n   169→```\n   170→\n   171→Register `appApi.reducer` and `appApi.middleware` in `src/store/index.ts`.\n   172→\n   173→Create `src/store/authSlice.ts` based on the template's version. This provides `useGetSessionQuery()` and `useSignOutMutation()` hooks, and a `getUserInfo` endpoint that calls the new Netlify function.\n   174→\n   175→Reference: `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`\n   176→\n   177→### 9.

Add a Supabase-based auth system that authenticates against the same auth service used by `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/` (i.e. `https://auth.nut.new`). All app data stays in Neon via `DATABASE_URL`; the only new table is a `users` table in Neon for mapping auth identities to local user records.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Current State\n\n- **No auth**: no login page, no session management, no token handling, no protected routes\n- **10 unprotected Netlify functions** using the Netlify v2 pattern (`(req: Request) => Response`) with Neon via `@neondatabase/serverless`\n- **Free-form author fields** that should use the authenticated user's name:\n  - `task_notes.author` (default `'User'`)\n  - `writeups.author` / `writeup_versions.author`\n  - `timeline_events.user_name` (default `'System'`)\n  - `contact_history.team_member`\n  - `deal_history.changed_by`\n\n### How the Template Auth Works\n\nThe template at `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/` authenticates against `https://auth.nut.new` (a Supabase instance). Key pieces:\n\n1. **Frontend** (`src/lib/auth.ts`): Creates a Supabase client using `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Patches `window.fetch` so every request to `/.netlify/functions/` automatically gets an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from the current Supabase session. This means existing frontend fetch calls need zero changes to start sending tokens.\n\n2. **Backend** (`netlify/utils/jwt.ts`): Verifies the JWT from the `Authorization` header against the JWKS at `https://auth.nut.new/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` using the `jose` library. On success, extracts user info from the JWT claims (`sub`, `email`, `user_metadata.full_name`, `app_metadata.provider`, `user_metadata.avatar_url`).\n\n3. **User sync**: The template syncs verified JWT claims to a `users` table via Supabase RPC. For the CRM, this should instead be a plain Neon SQL upsert into a `users` table in the existing Neon database.\n\n4. **Auth UI**: Login/Register pages using `@supabase/supabase-js` methods: `auth.signInWithPassword()`, `auth.signUp()`, `auth.signInWithOtp()`, `auth.resetPasswordForEmail()`. OAuth via redirect to `https://auth.nut.new/functions/v1/oauth/start`. Callback page at `/auth/callback` that extracts tokens from the URL hash.\n\n5. **React context** (`AuthProvider`): Exposes `useAuth()` with `{ isLoggedIn, user, loading, signOut, getUserId }`. Uses RTK Query to fetch session/user info.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Install Dependencies\n\nAdd to `package.json` (check first which are already present):\n\n```\n@supabase/supabase-js   — frontend Supabase auth client\njose                     — backend JWT verification\nreact-hook-form          — login/register forms\n@hookform/resolvers      — zod resolver for react-hook-form\nzod                      — form validation schemas\nsonner                   — toast notifications for auth errors\n```\n\n### 2. Environment Variables\n\nOnly two new env vars are needed:\n\n```bash\nVITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL=https://auth.nut.new\nVITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inpia2NhdnhpZGp5c2xxbW5iZnV4Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDAwMDU0MjAsImV4cCI6MjA1NTU4MTQyMH0.xHKTareBFW0LW0AmYXH0vOvU3mLB3jkQGwhoNWqpnTw\n```\n\n`DATABASE_URL` (Neon) stays the same. No Supabase service role key, no app ID, no auth-required flag needed.\n\n### 3. Add `users` Table to Neon\n\nAdd to `scripts/init-db.ts`:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  auth_user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  email TEXT NOT NULL,\n  name TEXT NOT NULL,\n  provider TEXT DEFAULT 'unknown',\n  avatar_url TEXT DEFAULT '',\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n);\n```\n\n### 4. Frontend Auth Client\n\nCreate `src/lib/auth.ts` based on the template's version. This file:\n- Creates a Supabase client with `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_AUTH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`\n- Overrides `window.fetch` to attach `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on all `/.netlify/functions/` calls\n- Exports `auth` (the `supabase.auth` object)\n\nReference: `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/src/lib/auth.ts`\n\n### 5. Backend Auth Middleware\n\nCreate `netlify/utils/auth.ts` — a simplified version of the template's `jwt.ts`, adapted for Neon and the v2 handler pattern. It should:\n\n- At module load, fetch JWKS from `https://auth.nut.new/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` and build a key resolver using `jose`\n- Export a `requiresAuth(handler)` wrapper that:\n  1. Reads the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from the request\n  2. Returns 401 if missing or invalid\n  3. Verifies the JWT signature using the cached JWKS keys\n  4. Extracts user info from the JWT payload: `sub` (auth_user_id), `email`, `user_metadata.full_name`, `app_metadata.provider`, `user_metadata.avatar_url`\n  5. Upserts into the Neon `users` table using the existing `getDb()` / `neon()` pattern:\n     ```sql\n     INSERT INTO users (auth_user_id, email, name, provider, avatar_url)\n     VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)\n     ON CONFLICT (auth_user_id) DO UPDATE SET\n       email = EXCLUDED.email, name = EXCLUDED.name,\n       provider = EXCLUDED.provider, avatar_url = EXCLUDED.avatar_url,\n       updated_at = NOW()\n     RETURNING *\n     ```\n  6. Attaches the user record to the request (e.g. as a property or via a wrapper object) and calls the inner handler\n- Keep the template's test-mode support (`IS_TEST` env var with a local test key) for Playwright tests\n\n**Key difference from template**: No Supabase service-role client on the backend at all. The user upsert is plain Neon SQL. No anonymous user fallback, no email allowlist, no app-ID check.\n\nSince the CRM uses the Netlify v2 handler pattern (`(req: Request) => Response`), the middleware should match that. A simple approach:\n\n```ts\ninterface AuthenticatedRequest extends Request {\n  user: { id: string; auth_user_id: string; email: string; name: string; avatar_url: string; provider: string }\n}\n\nexport function requiresAuth(handler: (req: AuthenticatedRequest) => Promise<Response>) {\n  return async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {\n    // verify JWT, upsert user, attach to request, call handler\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReference: `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/netlify/utils/jwt.ts` (for JWKS fetching, JWT verification, and JWT claim extraction logic)\n\n### 6. Create `getUserInfo` Endpoint\n\nCreate `netlify/functions/getUserInfo.ts`:\n- Wrapped with `requiresAuth`\n- Returns the authenticated user's `{ id, email, name, avatar_url }` as JSON\n\n### 7. Wrap Existing Netlify Functions\n\nEach of the 10 functions changes from:\n\n```ts\nexport default async function handler(req: Request) { ... }\n```\n\nTo:\n\n```ts\nimport { requiresAuth, type AuthenticatedRequest } from '../utils/auth'\n\nasync function handlerImpl(req: AuthenticatedRequest) {\n  // existing logic unchanged, plus req.user is now available\n}\n\nexport default requiresAuth(handlerImpl)\n```\n\nFor functions that write author/user fields, use `req.user.name` instead of hardcoded strings or request body values.\n\n### 8. RTK Query Base + Auth Slice\n\nCreate `src/store/appApi.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react\";\n\nexport const appApi = createApi({\n  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: \"/.netlify/functions/\" }),\n  tagTypes: [\"Session\", \"UserInfo\"],\n  endpoints: () => ({}),\n});\n```\n\nRegister `appApi.reducer` and `appApi.middleware` in `src/store/index.ts`.\n\nCreate `src/store/authSlice.ts` based on the template's version. This provides `useGetSessionQuery()` and `useSignOutMutation()` hooks, and a `getUserInfo` endpoint that calls the new Netlify function.\n\nReference: `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`\n\n### 9. AuthProvider Context\n\nCreate `src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx` based on the template's version. Provides `useAuth()` hook with `{ isLoggedIn, user, loading, signOut, getUserId }`.\n\nReference: `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`\n\n### 10. Auth Pages\n\nCreate these pages based on the template, styled to match the CRM's Linear-inspired design:\n\n| Page | Purpose | Reference |\n|---|---|---|\n| `src/pages/Login.tsx` | Login landing (Google OAuth button + email login option), email/password form, forgot password, magic link | Template `src/pages/Login.tsx` + `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` + `src/components/AuthUtils.tsx` |\n| `src/pages/Register.tsx` | Registration landing (Google OAuth + email), email/password form, email confirmation | Template `src/pages/Register.tsx` + `src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx` |\n| `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` | Handles OAuth redirect — extracts tokens from URL hash, stores in localStorage, redirects to `/` | Template `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` |\n\nAlso create `src/hooks/useOAuthPopup.ts` based on the template — handles OAuth by redirecting to `https://auth.nut.new/functions/v1/oauth/start` with the app's callback URL.\n\nReference: `~/record[REDACTED]/builder-assets/appTemplate/src/hooks/useOAuthPopup.ts`\n\n### 11. Update Routing and Entry Point\n\nModify `src/App.tsx`:\n- Add routes: `/login` → Login, `/register` → Register, `/auth/callback` → AuthCallback (outside `AppLayout`)\n- Redirect unauthenticated users to `/login` on all other routes\n\nModify `src/main.tsx`:\n- Import `src/lib/auth.ts` before anything else (activates the fetch interceptor)\n- Wrap app in `<AuthProvider>`\n\n### 12. User Display in Sidebar\n\nUpdate the sidebar/layout component to show the authenticated user's name and avatar (from `useAuth()`) and a sign-out button.\n\n### 13. Replace Author Fields\n\nBackend functions that write author-related fields should use `req.user.name` from the authenticated request instead of accepting it from the request body or defaulting to `'System'`/`'User'`:\n\n| Function | Field | Current | After |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `tasks.ts` | `task_notes.author` | `body.author ?? 'User'` | `req.user.name` |\n| `tasks.ts` | `timeline_events.user_name` | `'System'` | `req.user.name` |\n| `deal-detail.ts` | `writeups.author` | `body.author` | `req.user.name` |\n| `deal-detail.ts` | `deal_history.changed_by` | `body.changed_by` | `req.user.name` |\n| `clients.ts` | `timeline_events.user_name` | `'System'` or body | `req.user.name` |\n\n### 14. Update Tests\n\nThe template's `jwt.ts` supports `IS_TEST` mode with a local EC test key. Port this into the CRM's auth middleware so Playwright tests can generate valid JWTs without hitting the real auth service.\n\n---\n\n## Files to Create\n\n| File | Based on |\n|---|---|\n| `src/lib/auth.ts` | Template `src/lib/auth.ts` |\n| `src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx` | Template `src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx` |\n| `src/store/appApi.ts` | Template `src/store/slices/appApi.ts` |\n| `src/store/authSlice.ts` | Template `src/store/slices/authSlice.ts` |\n| `src/pages/Login.tsx` | Template `src/pages/Login.tsx` + `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` + `src/components/AuthUtils.tsx` |\n| `src/pages/Register.tsx` | Template `src/pages/Register.tsx` + `src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx` |\n| `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` | Template `src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx` |\n| `src/hooks/useOAuthPopup.ts` | Template `src/hooks/useOAuthPopup.ts` |\n| `netlify/utils/auth.ts` | Simplified from template `netlify/utils/jwt.ts` — uses Neon instead of Supabase for user sync |\n| `netlify/functions/getUserInfo.ts` | Template `netlify/functions/getUserInfo.ts` |\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Change |\n|---|---|\n| `package.json` | Add `@supabase/supabase-js`, `jose`, `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `zod`, `sonner` |\n| `scripts/init-db.ts` | Add `users` table |\n| `src/main.tsx` | Import `auth.ts` early, wrap app in `AuthProvider` |\n| `src/App.tsx` | Add `/login`, `/register`, `/auth/callback` routes; redirect unauthenticated users |\n| `src/store/index.ts` | Register `appApi.reducer` and `appApi.middleware` |\n| `netlify/functions/clients.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth`, use `req.user.name` for timeline events |\n| `netlify/functions/deals.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth` |\n| `netlify/functions/tasks.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth`, use `req.user.name` for notes and timeline events |\n| `netlify/functions/individuals.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth` |\n| `netlify/functions/client-timeline.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth` |\n| `netlify/functions/client-deals.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth` |\n| `netlify/functions/client-tasks.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth` |\n| `netlify/functions/client-people.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth` |\n| `netlify/functions/client-attachments.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth` |\n| `netlify/functions/deal-detail.ts` | Wrap with `requiresAuth`, use `req.user.name` for writeups/deal_history |\n| Sidebar/layout component | Add user avatar, name, and sign-out button |\n","numLines":264,"startLine":1,"totalLines":264}}}

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of task navigation. Let me create a summary report of my findings.\n\n## Task Navigation Summary\n\nBased on my analysis of the SalesCRM app, here's how task links work:\n\n### 1. **Route Definition**\nThe `/tasks/:taskId` route exists and is properly configured in the React Router setup:\n- **File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` (line 23)\n- The route maps to the `TaskDetailPage` component\n\n### 2. **Task Link Rendering Locations**\n\n#### **A. Tasks List Page** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TasksListPage.tsx`)\n- **Line 134**: When users click a `TaskCard`, it navigates to `/tasks/${task.id}`\n  ```tsx\n  function handleTaskClick(task: Task) {\n    navigate(`/tasks/${task.id}`)\n  }\n  ```\n- **Component**: `TaskCard` receives the onClick handler and triggers navigation when the entire card is clicked\n\n#### **B. TaskCard Component** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx`)\n- **Line 60**: The entire card is clickable and navigates to the task detail page\n- Full card click triggers the `onClick` callback passed from `TasksListPage`\n- Has action menu with Edit, Mark Complete, and Delete options\n\n#### **C. Client Detail Page - Tasks Section** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/TasksSection.tsx`)\n- **Lines 60-64**: Task items have LIMITED navigation - they only navigate if the task has an associated `deal_id`\n  ```tsx\n  onClick={() => {\n    if (task.deal_id) {\n      navigate(`/deals/${task.deal_id}`)\n    }\n  }}\n  ```\n- **Important**: Tasks without a deal_id are NOT clickable on the client detail page\n- Tasks show: title, due date, and deal name if applicable\n- Checkbox allows toggling completion status\n\n#### **D. Deal Detail Page - Linked Tasks Section** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/LinkedTasksSection.tsx`)\n- **Lines 46-84**: Tasks are displayed but NOT clickable\n- Only functionality is a checkbox to toggle completion status\n- Has an \"Add Task\" button to create new linked tasks\n- No navigation to task detail from here\n\n### 3. **Sidebar Navigation** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`)\n- **Lines 8-12**: Main navigation includes a \"Tasks\" link\n  ```tsx\n  { to: '/tasks', label: 'Tasks', icon: CheckSquare }\n  ```\n- This is a `NavLink` that navigates to `/tasks` (the tasks list page)\n\n### 4. **Task Detail Page** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TaskDetailPage.tsx`)\n- Accessed via `/tasks/:taskId` route (line 9)\n- **Line 20**: Has a back button that navigates to `/tasks` list\n- **Line 53**: After marking a task as canceled, navigates back to `/tasks`\n- Displays full task details including:\n  - Title, description, priority\n  - Due date, assignee, client name\n  - Deal name (if linked)\n  - Task status (Open/Completed)\n\n### 5. **Task Detail Header** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/task-detail/TaskDetailHeader.tsx`)\n- **Line 20**: Back button explicitly navigates to `/tasks` list\n- Shows task metadata in read-only format\n- Action buttons for Mark Complete and Cancel Task\n\n### Key Navigation Patterns:\n1. **Main Entry**: Sidebar → Tasks → Tasks List Page (`/tasks`)\n2. **Task Detail**: Click task card from list → `/tasks/:taskId`\n3. **Back Navigation**: From task detail → back to `/tasks` list\n4. **Client Context**: Tasks on client detail only link to deals if `deal_id` exists\n5. **Deal Context**: Tasks on deal detail are not clickable links\n\n**File Paths:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` - Route definition\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TaskDetailPage.tsx` - Detail page\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TasksListPage.tsx` - List page\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx` - Clickable card\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/TasksSection.tsx` - Client tasks (limited navigation)\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/LinkedTasksSection.tsx` - Deal tasks (no navigation)\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation menu\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/task-detail/TaskDetailHeader.tsx` - Back button\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/task-detail/TaskNotesSection.tsx` - Notes section"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a24c19f (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 35427\ntool_uses: 15\nduration_ms: 26460</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7345a35f-ea0e-4367-9ece-3b796e61f268","uuid":"5ce512ed-41e8-4c8c-9dff-b20d7bda0baa","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand how task links work in the SalesCRM app. Look at:\n1.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile a comprehensive summary for the user.\n\n## Summary: SalesCRM Deals Pipeline/Kanban View\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the pipeline/kanban functionality in the SalesCRM app. Here's what I found:\n\n### 1. DealsPipelineView Component\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deals/DealsPipelineView.tsx`\n\nThis is the main kanban view component with these key characteristics:\n\n- **Layout**: 6-column grid displaying the deal pipeline stages with color-coded top borders\n- **Stages**: `lead`, `qualification`, `discovery`, `proposal`, `negotiation`, `closed_won`\n- **Each column displays**:\n  - Stage name and deal count\n  - Total pipeline value for deals in that stage\n  - Individual deal cards\n\n**Deal Card Details** (nested `DealCard` component):\n- Shows deal name, client name, and formatted deal value\n- Displays status badge\n- Clickable to navigate to deal detail page\n- Simple card without drag-and-drop functionality\n\n```tsx\nconst PIPELINE_STAGES: { key: DealStage; label: string; color: string }[] = [\n  { key: 'lead', label: 'Lead', color: 'border-t-gray-400' },\n  { key: 'qualification', label: 'Qualification', color: 'border-t-accent-blue' },\n  { key: 'discovery', label: 'Discovery', color: 'border-t-accent-purple' },\n  { key: 'proposal', label: 'Proposal', color: 'border-t-accent' },\n  { key: 'negotiation', label: 'Negotiation', color: 'border-t-yellow-500' },\n  { key: 'closed_won', label: 'Closed Won', color: 'border-t-status-active' },\n]\n```\n\n### 2. Current State: NO Drag-and-Drop Functionality\n\n**Important Finding**: There is **NO existing drag-and-drop functionality** in the pipeline view:\n\n- No drag-and-drop libraries in `package.json` (no React Beautiful DnD, Dnd-kit, or similar)\n- Pipeline view is purely static/read-only for card movement\n- Deal stage changes can only be made through the Deal Detail page\n\n### 3. How Deal Stages Are Updated\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealDetailPage.tsx`\n\nStages can only be changed on the individual deal detail page:\n\n```tsx\nasync function handleStageChange(newStage: DealStage) {\n  if (!dealId) return\n  await dispatch(updateDeal({ dealId, data: { stage: newStage } }))\n  // Reload data...\n}\n```\n\nThe `DealDetailHeader` component (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/DealDetailHeader.tsx`) provides:\n- A dropdown select for all 7 stages (including `closed_lost`)\n- A \"Change Stage\" button that triggers the update\n\n### 4. API Endpoint for Updating Deal Stages\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/deals.ts`\n\n**Endpoint:** `PUT /.netlify/functions/deals/:dealId`\n\nKey implementation details:\n- Accepts JSON body with `stage` field among other updatable fields\n- **Automatically records deal history**: Creates a `deal_history` record when stage changes (tracks old_stage → new_stage)\n- **Creates timeline events**: Logs the stage change event for the client's activity timeline\n- Returns updated deal object with `client_name` included\n\n```tsx\n// Stage change logic (lines 197-218)\nif (body.stage) {\n  const existing = await sql`SELECT stage, client_id FROM deals WHERE id = ${dealId}::uuid`\n  if (existing.length > 0 && existing[0].stage !== body.stage) {\n    // Records deal history\n    await sql`\n      INSERT INTO deal_history (deal_id, old_stage, new_stage, changed_by)\n      VALUES (${dealId}::uuid, ${existing[0].stage}, ${body.stage}, 'System')\n    `\n    // Records timeline event\n    await sql`\n      INSERT INTO timeline_events (client_id, event_type, description, ...)\n      VALUES (..., 'deal_stage_changed', ...)\n    `\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Related Components\n\n- **StagePipeline** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/StagePipeline.tsx`): A visual progress indicator shown on deal detail page, not used in the kanban view\n- **DealsListPage** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealsListPage.tsx`): Toggles between table and pipeline views\n- **Deal Types** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/types/index.ts`): Defines `DealStage` type with 7 possible values\n\n### 6. Deal Type Definition\n\n```tsx\nexport type DealStage = 'lead' | 'qualification' | 'discovery' | 'proposal' | 'negotiation' | 'closed_won' | 'closed_lost'\n\nexport interface Deal {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  client_id: string\n  client_name: string\n  value: number\n  stage: DealStage\n  status: string\n  owner: string\n  probability: number\n  expected_close_date: string | null\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n}\n```\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\nThe current pipeline view is a **static kanban display** for visualization only. To implement drag-and-drop stage changes, you would need to:\n1. Add a drag-and-drop library (e.g., `react-beautiful-dnd` or `dnd-kit`)\n2. Modify `DealsPipelineView` component to handle drag events\n3.

Here are my findings:\n\n### 1. **DealAttachmentsSection Component**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/DealAttachmentsSection.tsx`\n\n- Simple display component (no upload logic)\n- Props:\n  - `attachments: Attachment[]`\n  - `onUpload: () => void` (triggers modal)\n  - `onDelete: (attachmentId: string) => void`\n- Renders a list of attachments with:\n  - File preview icon/thumbnail\n  - Filename, type label, and file size\n  - Download button (for documents)\n  - Delete button\n- No file upload UI in this component\n\n### 2. **UploadAttachmentModal Component**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/deal-detail/UploadAttachmentModal.tsx`\n\n**KEY DIFFERENCE from client attachments:** This modal takes a URL directly rather than uploading files.\n\nFeatures:\n- Modal form with three fields:\n  - `filename` (text input, required)\n  - `type` selector (document | link)\n  - `url` (text input, required)\n- No actual file upload capability\n- Returns data structure:\n  ```typescript\n  {\n    filename: string\n    type: string ('document' | 'link')\n    url: string\n    size: null // Always null\n  }\n  ```\n- Comment indicates: \"In production this would use UploadThing\" (on the client side modal, not here)\n\n### 3. **Backend API for Deal Attachments**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/deal-detail.ts` (lines 224-255)\n\n**Endpoints:**\n```\nPOST /deal-detail/attachments — Create attachment\nDELETE /deal-detail/attachments/:attachmentId — Delete attachment\n```\n\n**POST Handler** (lines 224-249):\n- Accepts: filename, type, url, size, deal_id, client_id\n- Inserts into `attachments` table with both deal_id and client_id\n- Returns created attachment\n- No file validation or upload processing\n\n**DELETE Handler** (lines 251-255):\n- Simple deletion by ID\n- No timeline event creation (unlike some other operations)\n\n### 4. **Database Schema**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/init-db.ts` (lines 210-221)\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS attachments (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  filename TEXT NOT NULL,\n  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('document', 'link')),\n  url TEXT NOT NULL,\n  size INTEGER,\n  client_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  deal_id UUID REFERENCES deals(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n)\n```\n\nKey points:\n- `type` is restricted to 'document' or 'link'\n- `url` is stored as text (can be blob URL or external link)\n- `deal_id` is optional (ON DELETE SET NULL)\n- `size` is optional integer\n- Attachments must have a `client_id` but `deal_id` is optional\n\n### 5. **Data Fetching on Deal Detail Page**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealDetailPage.tsx` (lines 57-74)\n\n- Uses `/.netlify/functions/deal-detail?dealId={dealId}` endpoint\n- Fetches attachments with SQL query filtering by deal_id:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT a.*, d.name as deal_name\n  FROM attachments a\n  LEFT JOIN deals d ON a.deal_id = d.id\n  WHERE a.deal_id = ${dealId}::uuid\n  ORDER BY a.created_at ASC\n  ```\n\n### 6. **Upload Flow on Deal Detail Page**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealDetailPage.tsx` (lines 164-184)\n\nProcess:\n1. User clicks Upload button → Opens `UploadAttachmentModal`\n2. User enters filename and URL (manually)\n3. Modal calls `handleUploadAttachment()` with:\n   ```typescript\n   {\n     filename: string\n     type: string\n     url: string\n     size: number | null\n   }\n   ```\n4. Handler POSTs to `/.netlify/functions/deal-detail/attachments` with:\n   ```typescript\n   {\n     ...data,\n     deal_id: dealId,\n     client_id: currentDeal.client_id,\n   }\n   ```\n5. On success: closes modal and reloads deal data via `loadDetailData()`\n\n### 7. **Client Attachments (For Comparison)**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/client-detail/AddAttachmentModal.tsx`\n\n**KEY DIFFERENCE:** Has real file upload capability\n- Toggle between \"File Upload\" and \"Link URL\" modes\n- File mode:\n  - Uses HTML5 file input\n  - Creates blob URL via `URL.createObjectURL(file)`\n  - **Comment**: \"In production this would use UploadThing\"\n- Link mode: Accepts manual URL\n- Returns data with actual file size from `file.size`\n\nBackend (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/client-attachments.ts`):\n- POST creates attachment and timeline event\n- Uses same attachments table\n- Can optionally link to a deal\n\n### 8. **UploadThing Configuration Status**\n**Installed but NOT USED:**\n- Package.json includes:\n  ```json\n  \"@uploadthing/react\": \"^7.1.0\",\n  \"uploadthing\": \"^7.4.0\"\n  ```\n- No API routes or handlers implemented\n- No `useUploadThing` hook usage found\n- No environment variables configured (no UPLOADTHING_SECRET, etc.)\n- `.env` file only contains: `DATABASE_URL=...`\n\n### 9. **Attachment Type System**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/attachmentUtils.ts`\n\nCategories detected from file extension:\n- Images: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg, bmp, ico\n- Videos: mp4, mov, avi, mkv, webm\n- Audio: mp3, wav, ogg, flac, aac\n- Spreadsheets: xls, xlsx, csv\n- Presentations: ppt, pptx, key\n- Code: js, ts, jsx, tsx, py, java, html, css, json, xml\n- Archives: zip, rar, tar, gz, 7z\n- Documents: pdf, doc, docx, txt, md, rtf\n- Links: (special type)\n\n### 10. **Attachment Display Component**\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/shared/AttachmentPreview.tsx`\n\n- Shows file type icon via Lucide React\n- For images: displays thumbnail if URL is valid\n- Falls back to icon for other types\n- Handles image loading errors gracefully\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Deal Attachments** work differently from Client Attachments:\n- **Deal Attachments**: Requires manual URL entry (no file upload)\n- **Client Attachments**: Has file upload capability with blob URL (but comment indicates UploadThing should be used in production)\n\nBoth use the same database table (`attachments`), with the `deal_id` field linking attachments to specific deals.

Add auth using the same Supabase auth service (auth.nut.new) as the appTemplate, with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, a fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, backend JWT verification via JWKS, and a users table in the existing Neon database. The 10 existing Netlify functions need to be protected, and free-form author fields (task_notes.author, writeups.author, timeline_events.user_name, deal_history.changed_by) should use the authenticated user's name.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n\n## Unreviewed\n\n(none)\n\n## Finished\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation.

Add auth using the same Supabase auth service (auth.nut.new) as the appTemplate, with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, a fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, backend JWT verification via JWKS, and a users table in the existing Neon database. The 10 existing Netlify functions need to be protected, and free-form author fields (task_notes.author, writeups.author, timeline_events.user_name, deal_history.changed_by) should use the authenticated user's name.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work.

Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation.

Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n- Before: 0cd095c\n- After: 78daa0a\n- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior. Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n\n2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n- Before: 0301f38\n- After: 0cd095c\n- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":5,"oldLines":10,"newStart":5,"newLines":13,"lines":[" 2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.

Output is streamed in real-time. Press ESC to interrupt. Subsequent messages continue the conversation.\n\n### Detached mode\n\n```bash\nnpm run agent -- \"<prompt>\"\nnpm run agent -- \"<prompt>\" -n 10   # limit iterations\n```\n\nRuns Claude in a loop inside a detached container. The first iteration runs the provided prompt; subsequent iterations run `performTasks.md` to process tasks from `docs/plan.md`. Each iteration commits changes and re-runs with a fresh context. Stops on `<DONE/>` or the iteration limit. All output is logged to a single `logs/worker-current.log` file.\n\n### Checking status\n\n```bash\nnpm run status\n```\n\nShows the container name, iteration progress, cost, and the last 20 lines of formatted log output. If the agent is still running, it tails the log in real-time (Ctrl+C to stop).\n\n## Other Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `npm run test-container` | Start a container with bash (no agent) |\n| `npm run docker:build` | Rebuild the Docker image |\n| `npm run status` | Show agent status, recent output, and tail if running |\n| `npm run reset-app -- <app>` | Reset an app to spec files only |\n| `npm run read-log -- <file>` | Render a log file as readable output |","is_error":false}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01Dd87TRZe8h4V92MvZeWdWr","session_id":"7345a35f-ea0e-4367-9ece-3b796e61f268","uuid":"1646b169-18eb-4367-a6d6-bc9fd176ea6c"}
