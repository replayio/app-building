No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs).

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch.

For every clickable element, test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result\n5.

Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10.

[2026-02-26T06:30:02.484Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_017buTxh7bcLzjtuK7HJPxFh","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup clearly. Let me systematically compare it against the test entries:\n\nFrom the mockup:\n1. Header: \"Account: Finished Goods Warehouse 2\" - large heading\n2. \"Type: Inventory Account\" below\n3. \"Status: Active\" badge (green)\n4. \"Edit Account\" button (with pencil icon, secondary style)\n5. \"+ New Transaction\" button (with + icon, primary blue)\n6. Sidebar with: Dashboard, Accounts (highlighted), Materials, Transactions, Reports, Settings\n7. \"Tracked Materials\" heading\n8. Table with columns: Material Name, Category, Unit of Measure, Total Quantity, Number of Batches, Actions\n\n\n9. Material rows with data and \"View Material in this Account\" action links with external link icons\n10. Search bar at top (global search)\n11. Notification bell icon at top right\n12. Help/question mark icon at top right\n13. User avatar at top right\n\nNow I'm checking the test entries against all directives. The sidebar navigation is tested for the Accounts link being active on the Account Detail page. For the systematic inventory of visible elements, I can see the header text and type are both tested, but I need to verify that all the other UI components like the status badge, buttons, table columns, and top-right icons are covered by the test entries.\n\nLooking through the test coverage, the status badge is tested for both active and archived states, the Edit Account and New Transaction buttons are tested, and the breadcrumb navigation is tested even though it doesn't appear in the mockup—the directive prioritizes consistent navigation styling over exact image adherence, so that's acceptable. The sidebar, Tracked Materials heading, table columns, material rows, and the View Material action links are all tested, and the material name is tested as clickable.\n\nI'm also checking off the empty state and navigation from the Accounts page. Now I'm scanning the mockup for any elements that might not be covered—there's a search bar at the top center, but that's likely a global component tested elsewhere. The notification bell, help icon, and user avatar are also top-level UI elements probably covered in global navigation tests. The account type and status display on the same line are covered, and while the description field isn't visible in the mockup, it's referenced in the Edit Account modal test, which makes sense since it only appears there.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking the test entries against the directives. The table columns match the mockup exactly. For every clickable element, I'm verifying the navigation targets: breadcrumb Home goes to /, breadcrumb Accounts goes to /accounts, the Edit Account button opens the modal, New Transaction navigates to /transactions/new, View Material links to the MaterialDetailPage, material names navigate to /materials/:materialId, and account rows navigate to /accounts/:accountId. I'm noticing the breadcrumb test mentions \"Home\" navigating to \"/\" but I need to verify this is correct.\n\nFor data mutation tests, I'm checking whether state changes persist and propagate correctly. The edit account modal test verifies the header updates immediately and persists to the database, but I'm questioning whether it also checks that the account name updates elsewhere in the app, like on the Accounts page list—this could be a gap in coverage since state-changing actions should trigger updates across related parts of the interface. carefully, it says \"the account header updates\" - that's the immediate effect. There might not need to be a test for the Accounts page updating if this is just a name change.\n\nActually, let me re-read directive 11: \"State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately.\"\n\nThe edit account action changes the account name. This should be reflected:\n- On the AccountDetailPage header (tested ✅)\n- On the AccountsPage list (not explicitly tested for)\n- In any other place the account name appears (TrackedMaterialsTable probably doesn't show account name)\n\nThis might be a violation. However, the AccountsPage tests likely already handle this. Let me check if there's a relevant test in the AccountsPage section.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the directives, they give specific examples like timeline/history features and symmetrical relationships. The InventoryTracker doesn't seem to have those, and the edit account change is straightforward - the test verifies the header updates immediately and the change persists, which seems sufficient.\n\nFor directive 6, the button styling checks out: the Edit Account button has a pencil icon and secondary styling, while the New Transaction button has a plus icon with primary styling, matching the mockup.\n\nNow I'm checking directive 7 on modal dialogs - the Edit Account modal opens properly... The X button and clicking outside the modal aren't explicitly tested, which could be a gap depending on whether those features actually exist in the implementation. Since the mockup doesn't show the modal itself, I can't verify if an X button is present, so this might be a legitimate limitation of the test coverage rather than a clear violation of the \"completely test modal dialogs\" directive.\n\nMoving through the remaining directives now—attachment functionality, import/upload dialogs, and backend integrations don't apply to this page, so I'm focusing on what's actually testable here.\n\nFor state-changing actions, the Edit Account test doesn't explicitly verify that the Accounts page list updates afterward, though that might be considered a separate concern. The New Transaction flow does properly test navigation and data pre-fill though.\n\nLooking at what's actually missing from the tests against the mockup, I notice the sidebar collapse button and global search bar aren't covered, though those might fall under broader navigation testing rather than this specific page's scope.\n\nChecking the existing test structure, I see the AccountDetailPage does test sidebar state, so some global elements are tested per-page. But elements like the search bar, notification bell, help icon, and user menu are probably global concerns that don't need testing on every individual page.\n\nNow I'm noticing an inconsistency in the account type naming—the test on line 537 refers to \"Inventory Account\" as a type, while line 550 mentions \"Stock, Input, Output\" as the types being tested. Looking back at the AppSpec, it defines categories as stock, input, and output, but the actual type display might be different. I need to clarify whether \"Inventory Account\" is the display name for stock accounts or if there's a mismatch in the test definitions. Looking at the AppSpec definition of categories as \"stock, input, output,\" I need to reconcile why the test entries show \"Inventory Account\" versus \"Stock\" for what should be the same concept. The directive requires test entries to match the app spec closely, so if one test uses the UI label \"Inventory Account\" while another uses the category name \"Stock,\" that's potentially inconsistent—though it could be intentional if the app displays different names in different contexts. I should check whether this represents a genuine spec violation or just different representations of the same underlying category. The breadcrumb is justified by the directive's emphasis on consistent navigation, so that's fine. The description field correctly isn't tested in the header since it only appears in the edit form. The main gap I'm seeing is whether the edit modal needs an X close button test—I should check if that's a standard pattern across other modals in the app. I'm noticing the \"with context indicating the current account\" phrasing is too vague—it doesn't specify whether the account context is passed via query parameter, URL parameter, or application state, which violates the directive requiring exact navigation targets. That's a legitimate issue to flag. Now I'm checking the material name click test to see if there are similar problems. I'm noticing a contradiction in the test entries themselves—one account shows \"Inventory Account\" as the type while another stock account shows \"Stock\" instead. This creates a conflict between what the mockup displays and what the AppSpec categories define, so one of these entries needs to be corrected to maintain consistency.\n\nNow I'm wrapping up my findings for Subtask 1 and identifying the directive violations I've discovered so far.\n\n**Potential violations found:**\n1. **Ambiguous navigation target in \"View Material in this Account\" test** (Directive 4) - Line 658 says \"with context indicating the current account\" which is ambiguous about how the context is passed.\n\n2. **Missing X close button test for Edit Account modal** (Directive 7) - The test spec doesn't include testing the X close button on the modal, but a complete modal test should cover all closing mechanisms. The spec itself doesn't mention an X button existing, so I need to determine whether this is a gap in what should be tested or if the directive is satisfied by testing the available close options.\n\nLooking at the modal's closing mechanisms, I see Save and Cancel buttons are tested, but most UI libraries like shadcn/ui include an X button by default. Since the directive emphasizes \"completely test\" modal behavior, this feels like a completeness gap worth flagging, though it's less critical than the navigation ambiguity issue.\n\nThe main violation I'm finding is the \"View Material in this Account\" test—it says \"with context indicating the current account\" but doesn't specify *how* that context gets passed (query parameter, URL fragment, etc.). The directive explicitly requires specifying exact navigation targets, not leaving them ambiguous.\n\nActually, wait—I'm second-guessing myself. The navigation target *is* specified as /materials/:materialId, and the \"context\" might just refer to what information the page displays, not the navigation mechanism itself. But the directive is pretty clear about needing exact specifications, and \"with context indicating\" is vague about the implementation details. I think this still counts as a violation, even if it's borderline. I need to clarify whether the navigation includes a query parameter like `?accountId=xxx`, or if it's just showing account context on the page, or scrolling to that account's section — the spec doesn't pin this down exactly, so that's a violation of the directive to specify exact navigation targets. Let me move on to checking subtask 2, though I should also double-check the mockup to see if there's anything I'm missing about the UI elements shown.\n\nLooking back at the mockup, I can account for all the pieces: the global navigation elements like the sidebar and top bar are tested elsewhere, the sidebar collapse is also covered globally, and elements 7 through 14 — the account heading, status info, buttons, and the materials table with its columns and actions — are all represented in the test entries. The test coverage appears complete for the AccountDetailPage itself.\n\nNow for the final assessment on Subtask 1: I found one violation with the \"View Material in this Account\" action buttons. The test describes navigation \"with context indicating the current account\" but doesn't specify how that context is actually passed — whether it's a query parameter, hash, or state object. The directive is clear that navigation targets can't be ambiguous, so this needs to be flagged.\n\nActually, let me reconsider whether this is how BDD specs are typically designed. Sometimes \"context\" is intentionally left to implementation details. But the directive explicitly prohibits ambiguous navigation destinations, so I should flag it as a violation and move forward to Subtask 2.\n\nBefore I do, let me double-check the \"Account header shows correct type for each account category\" test around line 550-556 to see what it's actually testing.\n\nI'm noticing a discrepancy between what the test specifies and what the mockup shows. The test defines account types as \"Stock,\" \"Input,\" and \"Output,\" but the mockup displays \"Inventory Account\" as the type label for what should be a stock account. Line 537 also references \"Inventory Account,\" creating conflicting information about what the type field should actually display. The AppSpec mentions stock, input, and output as the categories, but there's a mismatch between the test's terminology and the mockup's labeling that violates the directive requiring test entries to match the app spec closely. I see the inconsistency now — the test is using category names like \"Stock\" as the type, but the mockup shows \"Inventory Account\" and the AppSpec defines types as \"inventory, consumer, producer, or custom.\" This violates the directive about not substituting easier implementations for what the mockup actually shows, and the test entries need to align with the AppSpec's actual type definitions, not just the category names. The mockup shows \"Inventory Account\" as a type, which aligns with the AppSpec's \"inventory\" type, so the test entry using \"Stock\", \"Input\", \"Output\" instead of the proper type names is genuinely inconsistent. The real question is whether this violates a directive or just represents a content bug—looking at the directives, I shouldn't substitute easier implementations for what the mockup specifies, so this inconsistency does matter.\n\nLet me step back though. The clearer issue is the ambiguous navigation for \"View Material in this Account\"—but actually, re-reading the test, the navigation target is explicitly specified as /materials/:materialId, and the \"with context indicating the current account\" is just describing what the destination page should show, not the navigation itself. So that's not actually ambiguous. I think the navigation ambiguity is significant enough to warrant a fix task—the directive explicitly prohibits leaving destinations unclear, and \"with context indicating the current account\" doesn't specify whether that's automatic or requires a query parameter. I'm also noticing an inconsistency in the test spec itself: one entry describes a stock account type as \"Inventory Account\" while another calls it \"Stock,\" which suggests the test entries might not be matching the app spec as closely as they should.\n\nBut wait, I need to clarify what I'm actually checking here. The task specifically asks for directive violations, and looking at the testSpec structure, the \"match app spec\" requirement lives in the Requirements section, separate from the Directives section. The skill says to check directive violations, which I think means only the Directives section itself. So I should focus on those five directives and set aside the broader requirements question.\n\nLooking at the remaining directives—mutation persistence, button appearance, modal testing, file uploads, data formats, backend integration, and state-changing effects—the main violation I can identify is the \"View Material in this Account\" test being ambiguous about its navigation target. The modal dialog testing seems fine since the test entries only describe \"Save\" and \"Cancel\" buttons, so there's no X button to test. Let me verify this against the mockup to be sure.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking what's visible in the mockup against what's actually tested—the account heading, type, status badge, edit and transaction buttons, materials section heading, table structure, and material rows all appear to be covered. The material names might be clickable, but I need to see where that leads.\n\nI'm confident there's one violation for subtask 1. But let me think through the ambiguity one more time from a developer's perspective—if a test says the app navigates to a materials detail page with account context, it doesn't specify whether that's passed through a URL query parameter, a hash fragment, React state, or just a filtered view. That's genuinely unclear.\n\nActually, the directive explicitly says not to leave navigation destinations ambiguous, so this counts as a violation. Now I'm moving on to check the code and test

Let me go through each directive:\n\n**writeApp.md Directives:**\n\n1. **Run `npm run check` from app directory** — This is about process, not code. N/A for this check.\n\n2. **When working on a component, identify test entries and make sure requirements are satisfied** — Let me check if the component code matches the test entries.\n\n3. **Match visual appearance to mockup** — button variants, icons, badge/tag styling, section layouts.\n\n4. **All components must include `data-testid` attributes** on interactive elements, containers, list items.\n\n\n5. **Monorepo netlify.toml configuration** — Not specific to these components.\n6. **Neon serverless driver syntax** — Need to check backend functions.\n7. **Empty string to null conversion for date/timestamp/UUID columns** — Backend concern.\n8. **Netlify Functions path index** — Backend concern.\n9. **Searchable select/dropdown for entity references in modals** — The edit account modal doesn't reference other entities, so N/A.\n10. **Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links** — Need to verify the sidebar implementation.\n11. **Avoid native HTML `<select>` elements** — Let me check the components.\n12. **File-type-specific icons for attachments** — N/A.\n13. **Actual file upload functionality** — N/A.\n14. **Consistent padding on page components** — Need to verify.\n\nNow I'm examining AccountDetailPage.tsx to check the padding directive and test IDs across the page container and edit modal. I've verified all the test IDs are in place and the modal has the right styling and functionality. The edit flow works correctly — opening the modal, pre-filling data, saving changes, and canceling all function as expected, plus validation is working and the account type field is properly read-only. But I'm noticing the `typeLabel` function appears to be defined twice, which I need to investigate. AccountDetailPage.tsx (line 16-27) and once in AccountHeader.tsx (line 10-21). This is code duplication, but is it a directive violation?\n\nThe writeApp.md directive says \"All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\" This is a guideline, not a directive. But the duplicate `typeLabel` function is a code quality issue, not a directive violation.\n\nActually wait, let me look at this more carefully. In AccountDetailPage.tsx, the `typeLabel` is used at line 151 for the edit modal's Account Type field. In AccountHeader.tsx, the same `typeLabel` is used at line 53 for the Type display. So both use the same function, duplicated. This isn't a directive violation per se, but it's poor practice.\n\nNow I'm checking AccountHeader.tsx against the directives. The test IDs are all in place for the container, account name, type, status badge, and both action buttons. The Edit Account button has the pencil icon with secondary styling, and the New Transaction button has the plus icon with primary styling. The status badge is using the correct badge styling...\n\nNow I'm looking at the button text more carefully. The Edit Account button shows \"Edit Account\" on desktop but hides the text on mobile (only icon shows). The New Transaction button shows \"New Transaction\" but the test expects \"+ New Transaction\" with the plus icon. The plus icon is rendered separately from the text, so there's a mismatch between what the test expects and what's actually displayed. as an SVG icon. The test entry says the button text is \"New Transaction\" with a plus icon, which matches. ✅\n\nWait, the test entry on line 619 says: 'A \"+ New Transaction\" button is displayed'. And on line 621: 'The button has a plus (+) icon and the text \"New Transaction\"'. The button text in the code is \"New Transaction\" (line 113). The \"+\" comes from the icon. The display would be \"+ New Transaction\" which matches. ✅\n\nActually, wait. The test entry says `A \"+ New Transaction\" button` and `the text \"New Transaction\"`. These are slightly inconsistent (the first mentions \"+\" as part of the text, the second doesn't), but the code renders it as icon + \"New Transaction\" which visually looks like \"+ New Transaction\". This is fine.\n\n- **Directive 2 (test entries satisfied)**: The New Transaction button navigates to `/transactions/new?account_id=${account.id}`, which allows the NewTransactionPage to pre-fill the account. ✅ But I'm noticing the standalone NewTransactionButton component navigates without the account_id parameter, while the AccountHeader's button includes it—so there's a difference in behavior between the two.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the AccountDetailPage violates the guideline about abstracting JSX. The Edit Account modal is rendered inline in the page component rather than being extracted into a separate component file. The writeApp.md file distinguishes between \"Guidelines\" and \"Directives\"—the abstraction rule is listed as a Guideline, not a Directive. So this might not be a violation of the directives, but it does go against the guidelines. I'm settling on a pragmatic approach—I'll flag violations of both the Guidelines and Directives sections since the skill asks to check \"the skill document and all the directives.\" I've identified two issues so far: the edit account modal should be abstracted into its own component rather than rendered inline, and the `typeLabel` function appears to be duplicated across files.\n\nNow I'm checking the remaining directives, particularly the data-testid attributes in TrackedMaterialsTable.tsx to verify they're all properly implemented across the section container, empty state, table, and individual material rows. The NewTransactionButton component exists as a standalone piece but isn't actually used on the AccountDetailPage since the AccountHeader has its own inline button instead. Looking at the test spec, it lists separate components for EditAccountButton and NewTransactionButton, but these are actually embedded directly in AccountHeader.tsx rather than existing as separate files. The NewTransactionButton in AccountHeader is context-specific with account_id navigation, while the standalone component is used elsewhere without that parameter — that's a reasonable design choice. But the real issue is that the test spec expects EditAccountButton as a separate component file, which doesn't exist, and the edit modal's JSX lives in the page file rather than being abstracted into its own component, which directly violates the guideline about abstracting all JSX into separate component files.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test entry requirements are actually satisfied by the code.\n\nThe account header test expects \"Inventory Account\" as the type label, but the code is returning \"Stock\" instead — there's a mismatch between what the test spec says on line 537 and what the actual implementation produces.\n\nThe mockup shows \"Type: Inventory Account\", so the code doesn't match the visual design, which violates the requirement to match the mockup appearance. The status badge, breadcrumb, and edit button all appear to be implemented correctly.\n\nHowever, there's another issue: the edit modal also displays the typeLabel as \"Stock\" instead of \"Inventory Account\", which means the type mismatch persists even when editing the account. The New Transaction button correctly navigates with the account ID pre-filled, and I'm checking whether the View Material navigation is working as expected.\n\nI've identified a directive violation where the typeLabel function returns abbreviated values like \"Stock\" and \"Input\"/\"Output\" but the mockup specifies full labels like \"Inventory Account\" — this needs to be corrected to match the visual design requirements.\n\nThere's also a guideline violation where the Edit Account modal JSX is embedded directly in AccountDetailPage.tsx instead of being extracted into its own component file, which violates the requirement that all JSX be abstracted into separate React components.\n\nI'm also noticing the typeLabel function is duplicated across AccountDetailPage.tsx and AccountHeader.tsx, which is poor code organization.\n\nNow I'm second-guessing myself on the first violation — I need to verify whether \"Inventory Account\" is actually the correct display label for a STOCK account type in the mockup. The tests themselves are inconsistent—one expects \"Inventory Account\" while another expects \"Stock\"—and the code matches only the second test, not the mockup. This means I should have flagged this as a testSpec.md violation in subtask 1, since the test is substituting easier labels instead of matching what the mockup actually shows.\n\nI'll treat this as a combined violation affecting both the test entries and the code, then flag the modal abstraction issue separately. Now I'm checking the remaining writeApp.md directives around testids, native selects, and padding requirements.\n\nAccountDetailPage has the correct padding applied across its root elements. The navigation duplicate links directive doesn't apply here, and the neon driver syntax check belongs to the backend validation task instead. I'm noticing that EditAccountButton is referenced in the test spec but doesn't exist as a separate component file—the edit functionality is actually split between AccountHeader and AccountDetailPage.\n\nLooking at my findings for this subtask, I've identified two violations: the typeLabel function returns values that don't match the mockup (it shows \"Stock\"/\"Input\"/\"Output\" instead of \"Inventory Account\"), and the edit modal's JSX is rendered directly in AccountDetailPage rather than being abstracted into its own component.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether both violations count as \"directive\" violations. The writeApp.md document distinguishes between \"Guidelines\" and \"Directives\" sections—the type label mismatch is clearly a directive violation about matching the mockup, while the JSX abstraction rule falls under guidelines. Since the checkDirectives task specifically asks for directive violations, I should flag the type label mismatch as the primary violation and note the JSX abstraction as a secondary guideline violation.\n\nI also need to check if the test spec inconsistency about type labels ties back to subtask 1, then move on to reviewing the test files for subtask

The AppSpec also says types are \"inventory, consumer, producer, custom\" — not \"stock, input, output\". **VIOLATION of Directive 3: \"Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup.\"**\n- **Directive (button styling)**: Edit Account has pencil icon + btn-secondary ✅, New Transaction has plus icon + btn-primary ✅\n\n**Checking TrackedMaterialsTable.tsx:**\n- **Directive (data-testid)**: tracked-materials-section, tracked-materials-empty, tracked-materials-table, material-row-*, material-name-*, material-category-*, material-unit-*, material-quantity-*, material-batches-*, view-material-btn-* ✅\n- **Directive (match visual appearance)**: Columns, Σ Batches notation, external link icon all match mockup ✅\n- **Directive (native HTML select)**: None ✅\n\n**Checking NewTransactionButton.tsx:**\n- This standalone component is not actually used on the AccountDetailPage — the AccountHeader has its own inline button. No violations relevant to this page.\n\n**Additional note:** The `typeLabel` function is duplicated in both AccountDetailPage.tsx (line 16-27) and AccountHeader.tsx (line 10-21).\n\n**Violations found for subtask 2:**\n1. **Type label doesn't match mockup** — `typeLabel` returns \"Stock\"/\"Input\"/\"Output\" but the mockup shows \"Inventory Account\" (for stock). This also means the test entry inconsistency from subtask 1 (test line 537 expects \"Inventory Account\" but test line 550 expects \"Stock\") is a real problem — the code matches line 550 but NOT the mockup.\n2. **Edit Account modal not abstracted into component** — Modal JSX rendered inline in AccountDetailPage.tsx instead of a separate component file.\n\nNow let me proceed to subtask 3.

Only dashboard and deployment tests exist for InventoryTracker. So for subtask 3, there are no test files to check for writeTests.md directive violations — the tests simply don't exist yet.\n\nThis means I can't check for writeTests.md violations because there are no tests to check. I should note this.\n\nActually wait, the fact that tests don't exist might itself be a violation. But the writeTests.md skill is about WRITING tests. The checkDirectives skill checks if existing code/tests/docs follow directives. If there are no tests, there's nothing to violate the writeTests.md directives.\n\n\nNow I'm wrapping up subtask 3 and moving on to create fix tasks for the violations I found across the other subtasks. I've identified several issues: the navigation target for the \"View Material in this Account\" test is ambiguous, there's a type label mismatch between test entries, the code shows \"Stock\" while the mockup specifies \"Inventory Account\", and the Edit Account modal needs to be abstracted into its own component.\n\nI'm consolidating the type label issue into a single fix task since it affects both the test spec and the component code. The type label mismatch is clearly significant because it breaks the UI-mockup alignment, and the modal abstraction is a clear guideline violation, so both warrant fix tasks. The navigation target clarification is also worth documenting. The query parameter needs to be included in the test specification to match what the code actually does. So the navigation target should explicitly show `?account_id=${accountId}` rather than just the base route. I'll structure three fix tasks: one for the account type labels across both tests and components, one for extracting the modal into its own file, and one for updating the navigation target specification to include the query parameter. I'm weighing whether to combine the tests.md fixes or keep them separate based on root cause. The skill example shows each fix should have its own RunTests and DocumentFix subtasks, so I'll create distinct tasks for the type labels, modal abstraction, and nav target clarification rather than
