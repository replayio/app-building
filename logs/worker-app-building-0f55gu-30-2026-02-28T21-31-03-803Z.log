See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2.

I need to add the missing utility classes to `index.css`. Let me add the needed classes.\n[read] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/index.css\nNow let me add the missing utility classes:\n[edit] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/index.css\nNow add `max-sm:inline` to the 640px media query:\n[edit] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/index.css\nNow let me also handle the fixed-width amount input in QuantityTransfersSection. At mobile, it should expand. And let me also address the form-row pattern in the add row area. Let me re-read the updated files to verify:\n[read] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/QuantityTransfersSection.tsx\nGood. Now let me check the BatchAllocationSection:\n[read] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/BatchAllocationSection.tsx\nGood. Now let me also check the shared styles for common layout classes to make sure the flex/flex-col classes don't conflict:\n[grep] \\.flex\\b|\\.flex-col|\\.hidden\\b\nGood, no conflicts. Now let me also check if there are any other inline styles in the page or components that need responsive improvements. Let me look at the amount input with fixed width:\n[read] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/QuantityTransfersSection.tsx\nThe amount input width of 100px is reasonable for a numeric field even on mobile. The grid will collapse to single column at `max-sm:`, and the 100px input with the unit dropdown beside it will fit fine.\n\nNow let me run the type check to make sure everything compiles:\n$ cd /repo/apps/InventoryTracker && npm run check 2>&1 | tail -30\n> inventory-tracker@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nAll checks pass.
