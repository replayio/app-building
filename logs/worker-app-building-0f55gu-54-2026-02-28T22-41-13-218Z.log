You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Each log was from a previous review iteration that itself was analyzing logs. These are the meta-level review logs. Let me now summarize what shell commands were used in each log and write the analysis files.\n\nLet me analyze each log for shell commands:\n\n**Log 30** (`worker-app-building-0f55gu-30`): Previous AnalyzeGroup task analyzing test failures logs. Shell commands:\n- `mkdir -p /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-analysis`\n- Multiple `npm run read-log` commands (10 logs)\n\n\n- Listing the report directory and iterating through files to display their headers\n\n**Log 31** (`worker-app-building-0f55gu-31`): Previous AnalyzeGroup task analyzing test failures logs. Shell commands:\n- `mkdir -p /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-analysis`\n- Multiple `npm run read-log` commands (10 logs)\n- Listing the report directory\n\n**Log 32** (`worker-app-building-0f55gu-32`): Previous AnalyzeGroup task. Shell commands:\n- `mkdir -p /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-20260228-202738-analysis`\n- Multiple `npm run read-log` commands (10 logs)\n- Various `ls`, `npm run read-log | wc -l`, `npm run read-log | tail -80`, `npm run read-log | head -100`, `npm run read-log | grep`\n\n**Log 33** (`worker-app-building-0f55gu-33`): Previous AnalyzeGroup task analyzing 10 logs. Shell commands:\n- `mkdir -p /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-20260228-202738-analysis`\n\n**Log 34-35**: Running through the same AnalyzeGroup workflow again, creating the analysis directory and executing multiple log read commands sequentially across 10 logs, then verifying the output with directory listing.\n\n**Log 36-37**: Continuing with similar AnalyzeGroup tasks, though Log 37 switches to parallel agent execution and uses more specific directory verification with wildcard patterns to check for the generated log files.\n\n**Log 4-5**: Running the same analysis workflow again with the same report directory structure, then preparing to extract and compile the shell commands from each log into a new analysis file called `report-shellCommands-reference-apps-1-review-20260228-202738`. I'm starting to systematically pull out the specific commands from each log entry.\n\n**Log 30-31**: Looking at the actual Bash tool invocations—creating the analysis directory, running multiple read-log commands to pull in the logs, then verifying the output with directory listings and file content checks.\n\n**Log 32**: Similar pattern but with a timestamped directory, plus additional filtering operations like word counts, tail/head extracts, and grep searches to examine specific portions of the logs.\n\n**Log 33-34**: Continuing with directory creation and log reading, using agents to handle the log extraction work, then checking file status.\n\n**Log 35-37**: The pattern repeats with the same directory structure and log reading sequence, though Log 37 appears to be cut off mid-thought.\n\n**Log 4-5**: I'm using agents to parallelize the log reading process across all 10 logs, then I'll generate analysis files for each one based on the shell command
