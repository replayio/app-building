You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me analyze what I see:\n\n**Quick Actions section:**\n- Two large buttons side by side:\n  - \"Add New Supplier\" with a person-plus icon\n  - \"Create Purchase Order\" with a document icon\n\n**Upcoming Orders section:**\n- Heading: \"Upcoming Orders\"\n- Two filter dropdowns in the top-right: \"Filter\" and \"Filter Filter\" (likely a status filter and another filter)\n- Table with columns: Order Id, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, Total Cost\n- Sample data rows with Order IDs as links (#PO-2023-001 through #PO-2023-005)\n\n\n- Status badges showing \"In Transit\", \"Pending\", and \"Fulfilled\"\n\n**Suppliers List section:**\n- Heading: \"Suppliers List\"\n- Card grid layout (4 cards per row)\n- Each card displays the supplier name, an \"Active\" or \"On Hold\" status badge, contact information, and a summary showing open orders and total value\n\nNow I need to start building the PlanPageDashboard component.  The tests.md file already has the right structure with sections for QuickActions, UpcomingOrdersTable, and SuppliersList, so I'll fill in the descriptions and confirm the components match the mockup. The QuickActions section needs two buttons for adding suppliers and creating purchase orders, while the UpcomingOrdersTable displays order details with columns for Order ID, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, and Total Cost. The component structure matches the mockup well, so I'm confirming the breakdown is correct and now moving into writing the actual test entries for each section. I'll start by updating the DashboardPage description, then fill in test content for QuickActions, UpcomingOrdersTable, and SuppliersList components.\n\nFor the QuickActions buttons, \"Add New Supplier\" should trigger a modal for entering supplier details like name and contact info, which then adds the supplier to the list, while \"Create Purchase Order\" opens a similar modal for selecting a supplier and adding order items that appear in the orders table. Now I'm looking at the UpcomingOrdersTable structure with its columns for Order Id, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, and Total Cost, plus filter dropdowns.\n\nThe table needs to display clickable order IDs as links that navigate to details, render status badges with appropriate colors (blue for In Transit, yellow for Pending, green for Fulfilled), and support filtering by status and supplier. For the SuppliersList, I'm planning a card grid layout showing supplier names and status badges.\n\nNow I'm thinking through what the QuickActions buttons should actually do—they're meant to quickly add new suppliers or orders, so I need to understand what data structure a supplier requires based on the SupplierDetailsPage.\n\nFor the \"Add New Supplier\" modal, I should test that it opens with the right fields (name, address, contact info, description, status), that saving creates the supplier and shows it in the list, and that canceling closes without saving.\n\nSimilarly, the \"Create
