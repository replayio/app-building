No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files.

independently.\n\n---\n\n### Testing Documentation (from `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`)\n\nThe test file documents expected behavior for all pages. Key patterns:\n\n- **Given/When/Then** format for test cases\n- Tests cover user interactions, state changes, validation\n- Mock data includes: multiple clients, various statuses, tags, sources\n- Tests verify: filtering, sorting, navigation, CRUD operations\n- Data attributes for test IDs: `data-testid`\n\n**Test infrastructure** uses Playwright with ReplayIO for debugging.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Facts\n\n- **Component Count**: ~50 components across 55 TypeScript files\n- **Pages**: ClientDetailPage, ClientsListPage, DealDetailPage, DealsListPage, PersonDetailPage, TasksListPage\n- **Netlify Functions**: 4 (clients.ts, deals.ts, individuals.ts, tasks.ts)\n- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless\n- **Build Tool**: Vite\n- **Testing**: Playwright\n- **Package Size**: React 19, TypeScript 5.9, Tailwind 4.2\n\n---\n\n### Project Structure\n\n```\n/repo/apps/SalesCRM/\n├── src/\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── ClientDetailPage.tsx\n│   │   ├── ClientsListPage.tsx\n│   │   ├── DealDetailPage.tsx\n│   │   ├── DealsListPage.tsx\n│   │   ├── PersonDetailPage.tsx\n│   │   └── TasksListPage.tsx\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ClientHeader.tsx\n│   │   ├── QuickActions.tsx\n│   │   ├── SourceInfoSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ClientTasksSectionFull.tsx\n│   │   ├── ClientDealsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ClientAttachmentsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ClientPeopleSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ClientTimelineSection.tsx\n│   │   └── 41 other components\n│   ├── store/\n│   │   └── Redux slices and hooks\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── index.css\n├── netlify/functions/\n│   ├── clients.ts (23KB - main backend)\n│   ├── deals.ts\n│   ├── individuals.ts\n│   └── tasks.ts\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── schema.ts (Database schema)\n│   ├── test.ts\n│   ├── check.ts\n│   └── deploy.ts\n├── tests/\n│   ├── *.spec.ts (Playwright tests)\n├── docs/\n│   ├── tests.md (126KB comprehensive test specification)\n│   └── bugs/\n├── package.json\n├── playwright.config.ts\n├── vite.config.ts\n└── tsconfig.json\n```\n\nAll content provided above is extracted from the actual codebase files.

Let me now understand the full state of the code.\n\nLooking at both jobs:\n\n**Job 1: Build ClientDetailPage and all components**\nAll components already exist:\n- ClientDetailPage.tsx ✓\n- ClientHeader.tsx ✓\n- QuickActions.tsx ✓ (with all 4 modals: AddTaskModal, AddDealModal, AddAttachmentModal, AddPersonModal)\n- SourceInfoSection.tsx ✓\n- ClientTasksSectionFull.tsx ✓\n- ClientDealsSection.tsx ✓\n\n\n- ClientAttachmentsSection.tsx ✓\n- ClientPeopleSection.tsx ✓\n- ClientTimelineSection.tsx ✓\n- Backend functions in clients.ts ✓ (all endpoints exist)\n\nSo job 1 is already complete. The components are built, the backend functions exist, and the modals are all implemented.\n\n**Job 2: Add all missing data-testid attributes**\nLet me systematically go through the test spec and check if all needed data-testid attributes exist in the code. The tests reference elements by their text content and behavior rather than specific data-testid values, but I should verify what's actually needed.\n\nAccording to the writeApp.md directive, all components must include data-testid attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Let me audit the existing components to identify what's missing. I'm checking ClientDetailPage.tsx, ClientHeader.tsx, and other key components to see which data-testid attributes are already in place and which ones need to be added. Continuing through the QuickActions component and its modals, checking test IDs for task creation, due dates, priority settings, and other form fields... Continuing through the modal test IDs for attachments and person associations... Continuing through the remaining test IDs for the add-person dialog, then moving on to verify the test identifiers for the SourceInfoSection component. Continuing through the test IDs for the tasks and deals sections, verifying all the necessary data attributes are in place for proper testing coverage. I'm continuing through the attachments section test IDs, covering the view, download, and delete actions, plus the confirmation dialog, and now moving into the people section components. I'm finishing up the timeline section test IDs and now moving on to check the attachments section—I notice the attachment type label is missing a test ID, though I'm not sure if the tests actually need it since it's just a styled span. I need to add `data-testid=\"attachment-type-label\"` to the type label span and `data-testid=\"attachment-created-date\"` to the created date span. Looking at the test spec more carefully, I should also check if the timeline entry description needs a testid like `data-testid=\"timeline-description\"` to match the testing requirements. I need to verify whether the type label and created date fields actually need testids by checking what the Playwright tests are looking for, since the job description mentions both building the components and adding missing testids. tag-input`)\n- Task description textarea ✓ (`add-task-description`)\n- Task due date input ✓ (`add-task-due-date`)\n- Task priority select ✓ (`add-task-priority`)\n- Task create button ✓ (`add-task-create`)\n- Task cancel button ✓ (`add-task-cancel`)\n\n**Deal Modal tests expect:**\n- Deal creation dialog ✓ (`deal-creation-dialog`)\n- Deal name input ✓ (`add-deal-name`)\n- Deal value input ✓ (`add-deal-value`)\n- Deal stage select ✓ (`add-deal-stage`)\n- Deal create button ✓ (`add-deal-create`)\n- Deal cancel button ✓ (`add-deal-cancel`)\n\n**Attachment Modal tests expect:**\n- Attachment upload dialog ✓ (`attachment-upload-dialog`)\n- File input ✓ (`attachment-file-input`)\n- Upload button ✓ (`attachment-upload-button`)\n- Cancel button ✓ (`attachment-cancel-button`)\n\n**Person Modal tests expect:**\n- Person creation dialog ✓ (`person-creation-dialog`)\n- Person name input ✓ (`add-person-name`)\n- Person email input ✓ (`add-person-email`)\n- Person create button ✓ (`add-person-create`)\n- Person cancel button ✓ (`add-person-cancel`)\n\nContinuing through the rest of the test spec to ensure complete coverage of all interactive elements and their corresponding data-testid attributes.\n\nContinuing through the rest of the test spec to ensure complete coverage of all interactive elements and their corresponding data-testid attributes. I'm continuing through the test expectations for the remaining modals—the Deal Modal needs an owner input field and action buttons, the Attachment Modal requires a deal dropdown and file input, and the Person Modal includes search and create tabs for managing person associations. I've checked off the save and close buttons for the add person modal, and now I'm moving through the SourceInfoSection test requirements—verifying all the form inputs like acquisition source, channel, and date acquired are properly identified with their test IDs. ✓ (`source-info-fields`)\n- Acquisition source field ✓ (`acquisition-source-field`)\n- Campaign field ✓ (`campaign-field`)\n- Channel field ✓ (`channel-field`)\n- Date acquired field ✓ (`date-acquired-field`)\n\n**TasksSection tests expect:**\n- Tasks section ✓ (`tasks-section`)\n- Tasks heading ✓ (`tasks-heading`)\n- Unresolved label ✓ (`tasks-unresolved-label`)\n- Tasks list ✓ (`tasks-list`)\n- Task items ✓ (`task-item`)\n- Task checkboxes ✓ (`task-checkbox`)\n- Task names ✓ (`task-name`)\n- Task due dates ✓ (`task-due-date`)\n- Task deal associations ✓ (`task-deal-association`)\n- Empty state ✓ (`tasks-empty`)\n\nI'm checking the spec to see if task priority needs its own testid—the display spec only mentions checkbox, name, due date, and optional deal link, so no priority testid is needed. Moving on to verify the deals section has all the expected elements: section container, heading, list, individual deal items with name, stage, and value fields, plus an empty state.\n\nNow checking the attachments section—I see most elements are covered, but the type label and created date spans are missing their testids, which means I need to add those. The rest of the attachment controls like view, download, and delete buttons are accounted for, along with the delete confirmation dialog.\n\nFor the people section, all the expected elements are present including avatars, names, roles, and the remove button with its confirmation dialog. The timeline section is mostly there too—I'm verifying the dates, event types, and subject/actor links all have their proper testids.\n\nI'm noticing a few gaps though. The timeline description and icon elements are missing their testids, and I need to add `timeline-description` to the description span. I also found that the attachment type label and created date in the ClientAttachmentsSection are missing their testids as well.\n\nLooking back at the spec requirements, I can see that for attachments, the type label and created date are essential for testing, while for timeline entries, the icon and description are more of a nice-to-have since the core testable elements like date, event type, subject, and actor are already covered.\n\nThe real gaps I need to address are `attachment-type-label` and `attachment-created-date`. Beyond that, I should check other components like the tag removal buttons in ClientHeader and the person chip removal in AddPersonModal—these interactive elements would benefit from testids so tests can target specific tags or selected people to remove. I'm compiling the complete list of missing testids across these components, but I should prioritize the ones that would actually be tested in E2E scenarios rather than adding them everywhere. I notice the timeline title element needs a testid when it's not a link so tests can verify non-linked event titles. I'm also spotting that the deal dropdown options in QuickActions are missing testids entirely—both the \"None\" option and the individual deal buttons should have identifiers for testing purposes.\n\nNow I'm realizing I should add testids to the dropdown option buttons and the form-dropdown-menu container itself. Let me compile the full list of missing testids I've identified and then move forward with implementing all these changes to ensure the components are properly testable.\n\nLooking back at the job requirements, all these components already exist, so this is really about fixing violations in the existing code. I'm noticing some discrepancies between the test spec and current implementation—like how deal names are formatted in the tasks section and how attachments are displayed—that I should verify and correct.
