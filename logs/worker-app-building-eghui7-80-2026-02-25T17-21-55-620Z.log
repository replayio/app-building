A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

Systematically inventory every visible element — write test entry for each\n3. Do not substitute easier elements for what mockup shows\n4. Every clickable element must specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. Data mutations must verify persistence and exact side effects (no duplicates)\n6. Button/control appearance (text, icons, styling) must be tested\n7. Completely test modal dialogs\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must test that other parts of the app update (history, reciprocal relationships)\n\nNow let me go through each OrderDetailsPage section and test entry systematically.\n\n### OrderSummary section (lines 456-499)\n\n- **Display Order ID in Header** — Tests heading display.

OK.\n- **Display Line Item Row Data** — Tests row data with currency formatting. OK.\n- **Display Multiple Line Items** — Tests all line items. OK.\n- **Add Line Item** — Tests modal, persistence, CostBreakdown update, and history entry. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n- **Edit Line Item** — Tests modal pre-fill, persistence, CostBreakdown update, and history entry. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n- **Delete Line Item** — Tests confirmation dialog, CostBreakdown update, and history entry. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n\n### CostBreakdown section (lines 548-575)\n\n- **Display Subtotal** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Display Tax with Percentage** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Display Discount with Label** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Display Total Cost with Currency** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Cost Breakdown Updates When Line Items Change** — Tests recalculation.

[2026-02-25T17:21:38.493Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Wpry9T29SYr2croFVPzG6d","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Let me compare the mockup to the test entries carefully.\n\nFrom the mockup I see:\n1. Breadcrumb: \"Dashboard > Orders > Order #PO-2024-10-1234\" - test spec says the same. ✓\n2. Order Summary section with:\n   - \"Order Summary\" heading\n   - \"Purchase Order #PO-2024-10-1234 Details\" subtitle\n   - Edit button (pencil icon + \"Edit\" text)\n   - Print button (printer icon + \"Print\" text)\n   - Supplier: \"Acme Corp\" with external link icon\n   - Order Date: Oct 26, 2024\n   - Expected Delivery: Nov 15, 2024\n   - Status: Green badge with \"Approved\"\n   - Overall Cost: $12,450.00\n3. Line Items table with columns: SKU, Item Name / Description, Qty, Unit Price, Line Total with three rows of data. The mockup doesn't show action buttons on the line items, but the test spec includes them—that's acceptable since the spec allows for extra necessary features to make the app fully functional.\n4. Documents section on the right side with three documents that have View and download icons.\n5. Cost Breakdown section below Line Items showing Subtotal, Tax (8%), Discount (Contract Pricing), and Total Cost.\n6. Order History section on the right side below Documents displaying a timeline of four events in reverse chronological order with icons.\n\nI'm checking the mockup against the test spec to see what's missing or extra. The mockup doesn't show an Upload Document button that the spec mentions, but again, that falls under the allowance for adding necessary features. I'm also noticing the document icons are file-type-specific with different colors for PDFs versus PNGs.\n\nLooking more carefully at the breadcrumb navigation, the spec describes it at line 452 and mentions the navigation targets for Dashboard and Orders, but I need to verify there's actually a dedicated test entry that covers clicking those breadcrumb links.\n\nChecking the SupplierDetailsPage pattern at line 228, I see the same structure—breadcrumb navigation described in the section overview with navigation targets mentioned, but no explicit test entries for the individual breadcrumb clicks. This appears to be a consistent pattern throughout the spec, which means the breadcrumb link navigation isn't being tested as discrete items, violating the requirement that every clickable element needs its own test entry with specified navigation targets.\n\nI'm also noticing something else: the mockup doesn't show visible \"Add Item\" buttons for the line items or documents sections, yet the test spec includes entries for \"Add Line Item\" and similar actions. I need to determine whether these buttons are actually visible in the mockup or if they're being tested without being shown.\n\nLooking at the Order History section, I can see it displays four entries with different status icons, and the test spec covers these. The Documents section shows View and download icons for each document, which are also covered.\n\nThe main compliance issue I'm finding is that the breadcrumb links are clickable elements visible in the mockup but don't have dedicated test entries specifying their navigation targets. I should flag this as a violation of the directive requiring test entries for every clickable element.\n\nI'm also checking directive 9 about import/upload dialogs needing to specify expected data formats and verify that format documentation is visible to users before attempting uploads. The Edit dialog test also lacks cancel/close behavior and field validation checks, which directive 7 requires for complete modal testing. I'm noticing the same pattern across LineItemsTable—both the Add and Edit Line Item tests only cover the successful save path without testing cancellation or validation, which are gaps against directive 7's requirement for comprehensive modal dialog testing. The dialogs for editing orders and line items are missing cancel/close and validation test entries—something the Dashboard page handles with separate entries but OrderDetailsPage doesn't. This violates the directive requiring comprehensive coverage of all interactive states and error handling. the modal dialogs in OrderDetailsPage, I'm seeing a pattern where tests combine multiple actions—opening and saving together, but missing the cancel and validation scenarios. The same issue appears in the Upload Document test. So I have two main violation categories: missing breadcrumb test entries and incomplete modal dialog coverage for OrderDetailsPage. I should add fix tasks to address these
