ConfirmEmailPage\n\nI need to add one job group per page with the three check jobs, plus a backend group.\n\n\nI'm looking at the command format for adding job groups—it takes a strategy file and three check jobs that validate testSpec, writeApp, and writeTests directives for each page.\n\nNow I'm scanning through the actual pages in the codebase: SidebarNavigation, ClientsListPage, ClientDetailPage, and several others down to ResetPasswordPage and ConfirmEmailPage. Most of these pages have empty test sections in tests.md with just headers but no actual test entries, while only SidebarNavigation has populated test content.\n\nThe key question is whether I need to create job groups for pages with no test entries—the strategy says one group per page to check for violations, so even empty sections should get the checks since the directives still apply to the components and tests themselves.\n\nI'm going to add groups for all the pages, but I need to think about the order carefully. Since `add-group` puts new groups at the front by default, I should add the backend group first, then work through the pages in reverse order so they process in the right sequence.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2214,"cache_read_input_tokens":25995,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2214,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f3abb3dd-9f62-4fdd-9d6a-8accb0a9d66b","uuid":"99cb8180-adee-45a9-b6f3-13203377f960"}
