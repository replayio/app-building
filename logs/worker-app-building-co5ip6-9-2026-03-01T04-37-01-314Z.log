Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly.

NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n   102→  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n   103→  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n   104→  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n   105→  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n   106→  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n   107→  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n   108→\n   109→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   110→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   111→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   112→\n   113→## Tips\n   114→\n   115→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   116→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   117→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   118→  ```ts\n   119→  build: {\n   120→    sourcemap: true,\n   121→    minify: false,\n   122→  },\n   123→  define: {\n   124→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   125→  },\n   126→  ```\n   127→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   128→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   129→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   130→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   131→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   132→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   133→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   134→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   135→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   136→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   137→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   138→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   139→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   140→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   141→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   142→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   143→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   144→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   145→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   146→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   147→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   148→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   149→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   150→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   151→\n   152→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   153→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   154→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   155→\n   156→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   157→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   158→\n   159→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   160→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   161→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   162→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   163→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   164→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"64d9f3af-ee4b-45ff-bb98-17f713a89197","uuid":"feec3ab7-d8f7-4f63-9fc6-7e8a8cc48b8e","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":164,"startLine":1,"totalLines":164}}}

Let me go through each directive:\n\n### Directive 1: Neon tagged template literal syntax\n> When using the neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax: `sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}```. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n\nLet me check each file:\n- `schema.ts`: Uses tagged template literals ✅\n- `apps.ts`: Uses tagged template literals ✅\n- `set-default-prompt.ts`: Uses tagged template literals ✅\n\n\n- `request.ts`: Uses tagged template literals ✅\n- `status.ts`: Uses tagged template literals ✅\n- `activity.ts`: Uses tagged template literals ✅\n- `app-builder-event.ts`: Uses tagged template literals ✅\n- `spawn-container.ts`: Uses tagged template literals ✅\n- `spawn-container-background.ts`: Uses tagged template literals ✅\n\nAll good.\n\n### Directive 2: Empty string to null conversion\n> For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`.\n\nLet me check for proper null conversion patterns across the files.\n\nChecking through the inserts: `schema.ts` is just schema creation, `apps.ts` is read-only, and `set-default-prompt.ts` only touches TEXT columns. In `request.ts`, the TIMESTAMP columns have DEFAULT NOW() so they're handled automatically, and the TEXT fields like `requirements` are already using the correct `${requirements || null}` pattern.\n\nMoving through the rest of the files, `status.ts` and `activity.ts` have no inserts, while `app-builder-event.ts` and `spawn-container.ts` both use NOW() for their timestamps. `spawn-container-background.ts` does the same for its updates. Everything checks out on this directive.\n\nNow looking at the path indexing for resource IDs—functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` should have the function name at index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 when split on `/`.  Both `apps.ts` and `activity.ts` correctly pull the appId from segments[3], so that's good.\n\nFor the background functions directive, `spawn-container.ts` is the synchronous entry point that validates, inserts a pending record, and triggers the background function via HTTP before returning, while `spawn-container-background.ts` properly uses the v1 handler format with the `-background` suffix. Both are implemented correctly.\n\nNow checking the schema requirements: `schema.ts` exports an `initSchema` function that takes a database URL parameter and returns a Promise, without reading from the environment. It uses CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS for all tables including apps, app_requests, activity_log, containers, webhook_events, and settings, and it creates the necessary indices as well.\n\nFor database access, all queries are happening in the Netlify functions as expected.\n\nLet me verify the `netlify.toml` base setting and double-check the `app-builder-event.ts` file to make sure the payload is being constructed correctly.\n\nLooking at how the neon serverless driver handles parameterized queries, passing `JSON.stringify(payload)` as a string value should work fine for JSONB columns since PostgreSQL will implicitly cast valid JSON strings. Now I need to examine the `request.ts` file more carefully, particularly the INSERT statement...\n\nThe query sets `model`, `deployment_url`, and `source_url` to NULL directly, which is appropriate since these are TEXT columns and don't need the empty-string-to-null conversion. I should also verify the `netlify.toml` configuration and check if there are any other backend-relevant directives I'm missing. I've checked most of the key directives for backend functions, but I should verify the `netlify.toml` base setting and the Playwright configuration to be thorough, even though they're more about project setup than the function code itself. Checking the remaining directives about netlify.toml configuration, then I need to verify the schema tables align with what the backend functions are using, and look for any migration scripts that

Let me verify all the directives now:\n\n1. **netlify.toml base setting**: `base = \"apps/LoopBuilder\"` ✅\n2. **Playwright webServer --functions flag**: `command: 'npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions'` ✅\n\nNow let me do a final systematic check of all backend functions against all writeApp.md directives:\n\n### Systematic check of each function file:\n\n**`schema.ts`** (initSchema):\n- ✅ Exported `initSchema` function accepting `databaseUrl: string` parameter\n\n\n- ✅ Returns `Promise<void>`\n- ✅ Does NOT read `DATABASE_URL` from environment\n- ✅ Uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables\n- ✅ Creates indices\n- ✅ Uses tagged template literals for neon\n\n**`apps.ts`**:\n- ✅ Tagged template literals for neon queries\n- ✅ Resource ID at `segments[3]` (path index 3)\n- ✅ No DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID value inserts\n\n**`set-default-prompt.ts`**:\n- ✅ Tagged template literals for neon queries\n\n**`request.ts`**:\n- ✅ Tagged template literals for neon queries\n- ✅ Properly handles null values for TEXT columns\n- ✅ Timestamps use DEFAULT NOW() rather than explicit values\n\n**`status.ts`**, **`activity.ts`**, and **`app-builder-event.ts`** all use tagged template literals for neon queries, with resource IDs extracted from the correct path segment where applicable, and read-only operations where inserts aren't performed.\n\nFor the synchronous entry point in `spawn-container.ts`, I'm validating the input, inserting a pending record with NOW() for timestamps, triggering the background function, and returning immediately with a 200 status. The background handler in `spawn-container-background.ts` follows the v1 format with the `-background` suffix, also using tagged template literals and NOW() for timestamps. The `netlify.toml` configuration is set up with the correct base path.\n\nNow I'm checking whether there's migration logic for schema changes that go beyond what CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS can handle—the directive mentions this as a \"should\" rather than a \"must,\" so it's not necessarily a violation, but I want to verify if migration files exist. I'm also double-checking a few specific details, like how the payload is being stringified in `app-builder-event.ts` at line 70.\n\nLooking at the implementation, the JSONB column handling is correct since Neon's parameterized queries will pass the stringified JSON as a string that Postgres accepts. The NULL assignments in `request.ts` for `model`, `deployment_url`, and `source_url` are also fine since they're literal NULLs. I've confirmed all files use tagged template literals exclusively with no violations of the parameterized query pattern.\n\nLet me re-examine the empty string to null directive more carefully to make sure I haven't missed anything with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID type conversions.\n\nChecking through the functions, none of them actually receive DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID values from user input that could be empty strings. The timestamps are all generated with `NOW()`, and the only place I see a nullish coalescing pattern is in `app-builder-event.ts` where it's applied to a TEXT column anyway, not a date or timestamp field.","signature":"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

NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n\n- **`schema.ts`**: All queries use tagged template literals ✅\n- **`apps.ts`**: Lines 11, 23 — tagged template literals ✅\n- **`set-default-prompt.ts`**: Lines 8, 69-72 — tagged template literals ✅\n- **`request.ts`**: Lines 61-64, 79-82, 84-87 — tagged template literals ✅\n- **`status.ts`**: Lines 14-16 — tagged template literals ✅\n- **`activity.ts`**: Lines 23-27 — tagged template literals ✅\n- **`app-builder-event.ts`**: Lines 53-58, 60-65, 68-71 — tagged template literals ✅\n- **`spawn-container.ts`**: Lines 53, 71-74 — tagged template literals ✅\n- **`spawn-container-background.ts`**: Lines 70-74, 79-82 — tagged template literals ✅\n\n**No violations.**\n\n### Directive: Empty string to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns\n> Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`.\n\nAll timestamp values use SQL `NOW()` or `DEFAULT NOW()` — no user-provided DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID values are inserted.\n- `request.ts:63,86` — `${requirements || null}` for TEXT column (correct pattern) ✅\n- `app-builder-event.ts:50` — `body.status || null` for TEXT column ✅\n- `spawn-container.ts:50` — `body.prompt || null` for TEXT column ✅\n\n**No violations.**\n\n### Directive: Path index for resource ID\n> Resource ID at path index 3 (not 2) after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments.\n\n- **`apps.ts:7`**: `const appId = segments[3]` ✅\n- **`activity.ts:14`**: `const appId = segments[3]` ✅\n\n**No violations.**\n\n### Directive: Background functions for long-running operations\n> Must use `-background` filename suffix, v1 handler format.\n\n- **`spawn-container.ts`**: Synchronous entry — validates input, inserts pending record, triggers background function, returns immediately ✅\n- **`spawn-container-background.ts`**: Uses v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`), has `-background` suffix ✅\n\n**No violations.**\n\n### Directive: initSchema requirements\n> Exported function, accepts database URL string, returns Promise, does NOT read DATABASE_URL from env, uses CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS.\n\n- **`schema.ts`**: Accepts `databaseUrl: string`, returns `Promise<void>`, does not read env, all tables use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, creates all indices ✅\n\n**No violations.**\n\n### Directive: netlify.toml base setting\n> Add `base = \"apps/<AppName>\"` in monorepo setup.\n\n- **`netlify.toml:2`**: `base = \"apps/LoopBuilder\"` ✅\n\n**No violations.**\n\n### Directive: Playwright webServer --functions flag\n> Must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions` explicitly.\n\n- **`playwright.config.ts:22`**: `command: 'npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions'` ✅\n\n**No violations.**\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nAll 8 backend function files and the schema file were checked against all applicable writeApp.md directives. **No violations found.** Every function correctly uses:\n- Neon tagged template literals (never `sql(string, array)`)\n- Proper path indexing for resource IDs (index 3)\n- Background function pattern for long-running container spawning\n- Correct `initSchema` export pattern\n- Proper `netlify.toml` base and Playwright `--functions` flag"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":630,"cache_read_input_tokens":54789,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":630,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"64d9f3af-ee4b-45ff-bb98-17f713a89197","uuid":"0721b8ce-b77e-4619-acba-13d20150c6cf"}
