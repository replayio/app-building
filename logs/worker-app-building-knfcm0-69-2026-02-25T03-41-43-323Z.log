icons**\nGiven the app loads on any page, the sidebar displays exactly six navigation links — Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings — each with a corresponding icon. No Dashboard, Reports, or other placeholder links are shown.\n\n**Clients link navigates to /clients**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Clients\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /clients and the ClientsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Contacts link navigates to /contacts**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Contacts\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /contacts and the ContactsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Deals link navigates to /deals**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Deals\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /deals and the DealsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Tasks link navigates to /tasks**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Tasks\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /tasks and the TasksListPage is displayed.\n\n**Team link navigates to /users**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Team\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /users and the UsersListPage is displayed.\n\n**Settings link navigates to /settings**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Settings\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /settings and the SettingsPage is displayed.\n\n**Active link is visually highlighted for current page**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the \"Clients\" sidebar link has a visually distinct active state (e.g., highlighted background or bold text), and all other links appear in their default inactive style. The same highlighting applies to whichever page is current — navigating to /deals highlights \"Deals\", navigating to /tasks highlights \"Tasks\", etc.\n\n**Active state updates on navigation**\nGiven the user is on /clients with the \"Clients\" link highlighted, when they click the \"Deals\" link, the highlight moves from \"Clients\" to \"Deals\" and the app navigates to /deals.\n\n**Sidebar persists across page navigation**\nWhen the user navigates between pages (e.g., from /clients to /deals to /tasks), the sidebar remains visible and does not re-mount or lose state.\n\n#### SidebarAuth\n\n**Sign In button displays when not authenticated**\nGiven the user is not logged in, the sidebar user area (upper left, below the app title) shows a \"Sign In\" button. No avatar, name, or sign-out control is visible.\n\n**Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form**\nGiven the user is not authenticated, when they click the \"Sign In\" button, an inline form appears within the sidebar containing: an email input field, a password input field, a \"Sign In\" submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch to \"Sign Up\" mode.\n\n**Sign In form submission with valid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters a valid email and password and clicks the \"Sign In\" submit button, the user is authenticated, the inline form disappears, and the sidebar user area shows the user's avatar (or initials), name, and a sign-out button.\n\n**Sign In form shows error for invalid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters an invalid email/password combination and clicks \"Sign In\", an error message is displayed within the form and the form remains visible for correction.\n\n**Sign In / Sign Up toggle switches form mode**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user clicks the \"Sign Up\" toggle, the form switches to Sign Up mode — the submit button text changes to \"Sign Up\" and the toggle text changes to allow switching back to \"Sign In\".

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ca254283-9e3b-4262-9b55-038a3d781a39","uuid":"8b6b5850-9eef-4945-bc86-9bde27e42254","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

Complete File Listing (All Files with Paths)\n\n**Authentication & State Management:**\n- /repo/apps/shared/auth/authSlice.ts\n- /repo/apps/shared/auth/useAuth.ts\n- /repo/apps/shared/store/store.ts\n- /repo/apps/shared/store/hooks.ts\n\n**Backend Utilities:**\n- /repo/apps/shared/backend/db.ts\n\n**Components (UI Components):**\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/SearchableSelect.tsx\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.tsx\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/Pagination.tsx\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/CommentsSection.tsx\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/CategorySection.tsx\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.css\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/CategorySection.css\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/CommentsSection.css\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/ConfirmDialog.css\n- /repo/apps/shared/components/Pagination.css\n\n**Layout Components:**\n- /repo/apps/shared/layout/AppLayout.tsx\n- /repo/apps/shared/layout/Sidebar.tsx\n\n**Utilities:**\n- /repo/apps/shared/utils/date.ts\n- /repo/apps/shared/utils/currency.ts\n- /repo/apps/shared/utils/doubleEntry.ts\n\n**Styles:**\n- /repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css\n- /repo/apps/shared/styles/layout.css\n- /repo/apps/shared/styles/common.css\n\n---\n\n### 2. Patterns Being Used\n\n**Auth Pattern (Redux + Hooks):**\n- `authSlice.ts`: Redux slice with `setUser`, `clearUser`, `setLoading` actions\n- `useAuth.ts`: Custom hook wrapping Redux dispatch/selector providing `login`, `logout`, `setAuthLoading` methods\n- State structure: `{ user: AuthUser | null, isAuthenticated: boolean, isLoading: boolean }`\n\n**Store Pattern (Redux Toolkit):**\n- `createAppStore()`: Factory function accepting reducers + optional middleware\n- `createTypedHooks<RootState, AppDispatch>()`: Factory for typed Redux hooks\n- Apps provide their own reducers and middleware, shared function handles configuration\n\n**Backend Pattern (Neon Database):**\n- `getDb()`: Singleton function returning Neon query function\n- `query<T>()`: Parameterized query returning array of rows\n- `queryOne<T>()`: Parameterized query returning single row or null\n- `errorResponse()`, `jsonResponse()`: Standard Netlify function response helpers\n\n**Component Patterns:**\n- All components are functional, React.FC style\n- Props interfaces exported for type safety\n- Data-testid attributes throughout for testing\n- Comprehensive CSS class naming (BEM-like: `.component-name`, `.component-name-child`)\n\n**Utility Patterns:**\n- Pure functions with sensible defaults\n- Intl API for localization-ready formatting\n- Double-entry validation for financial/inventory transactions\n\n---\n\n### 3. Key Files Content & Architecture\n\n**Auth System:**\n- Manages user state (id, name, email, avatarUrl)\n- Tracks authentication and loading states\n- Simple login/logout flow with Redux dispatch\n- Designed to work with any auth provider (hooks are flexible)\n\n**Store Configuration:**\n- Flexible, app-specific: each app passes its own reducers\n- Configures Redux Toolkit with customizable middleware\n- Pattern supports multiple independent apps with shared config\n\n**Database Access:**\n- Uses Neon (serverless PostgreSQL)\n- Connection pooling via singleton pattern\n- Generic typing for type-safe queries\n- Error handling for missing DATABASE_URL\n\n**UI Components:**\n1. **SearchableSelect**: Dropdown with text search, used in Accounting and InventoryTracker\n2. **Breadcrumb**: Navigation trail with clickable items\n3. **ConfirmDialog**: Modal confirmation dialog with overlay\n4. **Pagination**: First/Previous/Next/Last navigation with page info\n5. **CommentsSection**: Comments/notes input and display with author, role, date\n6. **CategorySection**: Collapsible grouped items with optional totals (used for account/material categorization)\n\n**Layout:**\n- **AppLayout**: Main wrapper with sidebar + content area\n- **Sidebar**: Navigation menu with app name, nav items, user info, logout button\n- Flexbox-based, responsive layout\n\n**Utilities:**\n1. **date.ts**: `formatDate()`, `formatDateTime()`, `formatDateRange()` with locale support\n2. **currency.ts**: `formatCurrency()`, `formatNumber()`, `parseCurrency()` for financial data\n3. **doubleEntry.ts**: Transaction validation functions:\n   - `validateEntriesBalanced()`: Check debits = credits\n   - `validateNonZeroAmounts()`: No zero entries\n   - `validateAccountIds()`: Valid account references\n   - `validateTransaction()`: Combined validation\n   - `computeDebitCreditTotals()`: Calculate totals and balanced status\n\n**Styling System:**\n- CSS Variables (tokens): Colors, sizing, shadows, fonts\n- Light and dark theme tokens defined\n- Consistent color palette: brand green (#4d7c5e), grays, status colors (success, warning, error, info)\n- Sidebar width: 240px\n- Control border-radius: 4px\n- Typography: Inter Variable font family\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me create a comprehensive summary of the app implementations and patterns.\n\n## Summary: Existing App Implementations and Code Patterns\n\nBased on my exploration of the codebase, here's what I found:\n\n### Apps with Actual Implementations (Not Just Specs)\n\n**1. ProductionHub** (FULLY BUILT)\n- **Files**: 36 TypeScript/TSX files in `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/`\n- **Structure**: \n  - Components: 17 files (CalendarGrid, EquipmentTable, RecipesTable, etc.)\n  - Pages: 6 files (CalendarPage, EquipmentPage, RecipesPage, RunDetailsPage, etc.)\n  - Slices: 3 Redux slices (equipmentSlice, recipesSlice, runsSlice)\n- **Key Features**: Equipment/Recipe management with calendar view, tables with pagination, detail pages with related data\n\n**2. Accounting** (PARTIALLY BUILT)\n- **Files**: 22 TypeScript/TSX files in `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/`\n- **Structure**:\n  - Components: 5 files (NavBar, NewTransactionModal, AccountCard, etc.)\n  - Pages: 8 files (LoginPage, DashboardPage, AccountsPage, ReportListPage, etc.)\n  - Slices: 4 Redux slices (accountsSlice, transactionsSlice, reportsSlice, budgetsSlice)\n- **Key Features**: Accounting dashboard, transaction modal with double-entry validation, category grouping\n- **Status**: Many detail pages are stubbed out (LoginPage, AccountDetailPage show \"To be implemented\")\n\n**3. InventoryTracker** (PARTIALLY BUILT)\n- **Files**: 29 TypeScript/TSX files in `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/`\n- **Structure**:\n  - Components: 8 files (NavigationHeader, CategoryFilter, RecentTransactionsTable, etc.)\n  - Pages: 11 files (DashboardPage, MaterialsPage, BatchesPage, TransactionsPage, etc.)\n  - Slices: 6 Redux slices (accountsSlice, materialsSlice, batchesSlice, transactionsSlice, etc.)\n- **Key Features**: Material/batch/transaction tracking with filters, navigation header\n- **Status**: Many pages are stubbed out (MaterialsPage, MaterialDetailPage show minimal content)\n\n**4. SupplierTracker** (NOT BUILT)\n- No `/repo/apps/SupplierTracker/src/` directory exists\n\n**5. SalesCRM** (NOT BUILT)\n- Only has spec files: AppSpec.md and AppRevisions.md\n- No `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/` directory exists\n\n---\n\n### Shared Components and Patterns\n\nLocated in `/repo/apps/shared/`, these are reusable across all apps:\n\n**Shared Components:**\n- `Pagination.tsx` - Page navigation (first, prev, next, last buttons)\n- `SearchableSelect.tsx` - Dropdown select with search filtering\n- `ConfirmDialog.tsx` - Confirmation modal for destructive actions\n- `CategorySection.tsx` - Collapsible category groups (used by Accounting for account types)\n- `Breadcrumb.tsx` - Navigation breadcrumbs\n- `CommentsSection.tsx` - Comment/note threads\n\n**Shared Services:**\n- `authSlice.ts` - Redux auth state (user, isAuthenticated, isLoading)\n- `store.ts` - createAppStore factory for all apps\n- `hooks.ts` - useAppDispatch and useAppSelector\n- Utilities: `currency.ts`, `date.ts`, `doubleEntry.ts`\n\n---\n\n### Code Patterns Used Across Apps\n\n#### 1. Navigation Patterns\n- **ProductionHub**: Sidebar navigation with icons (`NavigationSidebar.tsx`)\n- **InventoryTracker & Accounting**: Header navigation bar (`NavigationHeader.tsx`, `NavBar.tsx`)\n- All use `react-router-dom` with `useNavigate` and `useLocation`\n- Navigation items stored as config arrays\n\n#### 2. Modal Patterns\nAll apps use consistent modal structure:\n```tsx\n<div className=\"modal-overlay\" onClick={onClose}>\n  <div className=\"modal-content\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n    <div className=\"modal-header\">\n      <h2 className=\"modal-title\">Title</h2>\n      <button className=\"modal-close-btn\">X</button>\n    </div>\n    {/* form fields */}\n    <div className=\"modal-footer\">\n      <button>Cancel</button>\n      <button>Submit</button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n#### 3. Table Patterns\nAll tables follow the same pattern:\n- Data tables with thead/tbody\n- Pagination component at bottom\n- Empty state message when no items\n- Action buttons (edit, delete) with onClick handlers that stopPropagation\n- Row selection highlights with \"selected\" class\n- Status badges for filtering\n\n#### 4. Filter Patterns\nMultiple filter types:\n- **Search input**: Icon + input field, case-insensitive filtering with `includes()`\n- **Dropdown filters**: Status/category dropdowns with outside-click detection via useRef\n- **Combined filters**: All filters applied together via `useMemo` for derivedState\n- RecipesPage shows best pattern: search + status filter + pagination\n\n#### 5. Detail Page Patterns\nProductionHub RecipeDetailsPage pattern:\n```tsx\n1. useParams to get ID\n2. useEffect to fetch detail (fetchRecipeById)\n3. Show loading/error/empty states\n4. Render header + sections with related data\n5. Return () cleanup dispatch (clearCurrentRecipe)\n```\n\n#### 6. State Management (Redux)\nAll apps follow consistent Redux pattern:\n```tsx\n// In store.ts\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  reducer: {\n    auth: authReducer,\n    feature1: feature1Reducer,\n    feature2: feature2Reducer,\n  },\n});\n\n// Slices use createAsyncThunk for API calls\nexport const fetchItems = createAsyncThunk(\n  \"items/fetchItems\",\n  async () => {\n    const res = await fetch(\"/.netlify/functions/items\");\n    return await res.json();\n  }\n);\n```\n\n#### 7. Form Patterns\nCommon across all modals:\n- Text inputs with `.form-input` class\n- Textarea with `.form-textarea`\n- Date inputs\n- Number inputs with min/step attributes\n- Form groups with labels\n- Validation: check required fields before enabling submit\n- Show loading state during submit: `{submitting ? \"Saving...\" : \"Save\"}`\n\n#### 8. Dropdown Patterns (Custom)\nConsistent implementation across CategoryFilter, RecipesHeader:\n- `useState` for open/closed\n- `useRef` for detecting outside clicks\n- `useEffect` with mousedown listener cleanup\n- CSS classes: `.custom-dropdown`, `.custom-dropdown-menu`, `.custom-dropdown-item--selected`\n\n---\n\n### Patterns Most Relevant to SalesCRM Needs\n\nBased on SalesCRM's spec requirements, here are the patterns that will be useful:\n\n**1. List Pages with Filtering** ✓\n- RecipesPage shows excellent pattern for ClientsListPage\n- Search + status/category filters + pagination all together\n- RecipesHeader component is reusable\n\n**2. Detail Pages with Sections** ✓\n- RecipeDetailsPage shows header + multiple content sections\n- CategorySection can organize clients by status\n- Good for ClientDetailPage structure\n\n**3. Modal Patterns** ✓\n- NewTransactionModal shows complex form with add/remove rows\n- Can be adapted for task/deal/attachment creation\n\n**4. Table Patterns** ✓\n- RecentTransactionsTable shows navigation links in tables\n- Edit/delete button patterns are consistent\n- Pagination shared component ready to use\n\n**5. Multi-section Layout** ✓\n- Accounting's AccountsPage uses CategoryGroup to group items\n- InventoryTracker's NavigationHeader shows simpler header approach\n\n**6.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me create a comprehensive summary of the app implementations and patterns.\n\n## Summary: Existing App Implementations and Code Patterns\n\nBased on my exploration of the codebase, here's what I found:\n\n### Apps with Actual Implementations (Not Just Specs)\n\n**1. ProductionHub** (FULLY BUILT)\n- **Files**: 36 TypeScript/TSX files in `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/`\n- **Structure**: \n  - Components: 17 files (CalendarGrid, EquipmentTable, RecipesTable, etc.)\n  - Pages: 6 files (CalendarPage, EquipmentPage, RecipesPage, RunDetailsPage, etc.)\n  - Slices: 3 Redux slices (equipmentSlice, recipesSlice, runsSlice)\n- **Key Features**: Equipment/Recipe management with calendar view, tables with pagination, detail pages with related data\n\n**2. Accounting** (PARTIALLY BUILT)\n- **Files**: 22 TypeScript/TSX files in `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/`\n- **Structure**:\n  - Components: 5 files (NavBar, NewTransactionModal, AccountCard, etc.)\n  - Pages: 8 files (LoginPage, DashboardPage, AccountsPage, ReportListPage, etc.)\n  - Slices: 4 Redux slices (accountsSlice, transactionsSlice, reportsSlice, budgetsSlice)\n- **Key Features**: Accounting dashboard, transaction modal with double-entry validation, category grouping\n- **Status**: Many detail pages are stubbed out (LoginPage, AccountDetailPage show \"To be implemented\")\n\n**3. InventoryTracker** (PARTIALLY BUILT)\n- **Files**: 29 TypeScript/TSX files in `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/`\n- **Structure**:\n  - Components: 8 files (NavigationHeader, CategoryFilter, RecentTransactionsTable, etc.)\n  - Pages: 11 files (DashboardPage, MaterialsPage, BatchesPage, TransactionsPage, etc.)\n  - Slices: 6 Redux slices (accountsSlice, materialsSlice, batchesSlice, transactionsSlice, etc.)\n- **Key Features**: Material/batch/transaction tracking with filters, navigation header\n- **Status**: Many pages are stubbed out (MaterialsPage, MaterialDetailPage show minimal content)\n\n**4. SupplierTracker** (NOT BUILT)\n- No `/repo/apps/SupplierTracker/src/` directory exists\n\n**5. SalesCRM** (NOT BUILT)\n- Only has spec files: AppSpec.md and AppRevisions.md\n- No `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/` directory exists\n\n---\n\n### Shared Components and Patterns\n\nLocated in `/repo/apps/shared/`, these are reusable across all apps:\n\n**Shared Components:**\n- `Pagination.tsx` - Page navigation (first, prev, next, last buttons)\n- `SearchableSelect.tsx` - Dropdown select with search filtering\n- `ConfirmDialog.tsx` - Confirmation modal for destructive actions\n- `CategorySection.tsx` - Collapsible category groups (used by Accounting for account types)\n- `Breadcrumb.tsx` - Navigation breadcrumbs\n- `CommentsSection.tsx` - Comment/note threads\n\n**Shared Services:**\n- `authSlice.ts` - Redux auth state (user, isAuthenticated, isLoading)\n- `store.ts` - createAppStore factory for all apps\n- `hooks.ts` - useAppDispatch and useAppSelector\n- Utilities: `currency.ts`, `date.ts`, `doubleEntry.ts`\n\n---\n\n### Code Patterns Used Across Apps\n\n#### 1. Navigation Patterns\n- **ProductionHub**: Sidebar navigation with icons (`NavigationSidebar.tsx`)\n- **InventoryTracker & Accounting**: Header navigation bar (`NavigationHeader.tsx`, `NavBar.tsx`)\n- All use `react-router-dom` with `useNavigate` and `useLocation`\n- Navigation items stored as config arrays\n\n#### 2. Modal Patterns\nAll apps use consistent modal structure:\n```tsx\n<div className=\"modal-overlay\" onClick={onClose}>\n  <div className=\"modal-content\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n    <div className=\"modal-header\">\n      <h2 className=\"modal-title\">Title</h2>\n      <button className=\"modal-close-btn\">X</button>\n    </div>\n    {/* form fields */}\n    <div className=\"modal-footer\">\n      <button>Cancel</button>\n      <button>Submit</button>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n#### 3. Table Patterns\nAll tables follow the same pattern:\n- Data tables with thead/tbody\n- Pagination component at bottom\n- Empty state message when no items\n- Action buttons (edit, delete) with onClick handlers that stopPropagation\n- Row selection highlights with \"selected\" class\n- Status badges for filtering\n\n#### 4. Filter Patterns\nMultiple filter types:\n- **Search input**: Icon + input field, case-insensitive filtering with `includes()`\n- **Dropdown filters**: Status/category dropdowns with outside-click detection via useRef\n- **Combined filters**: All filters applied together via `useMemo` for derivedState\n- RecipesPage shows best pattern: search + status filter + pagination\n\n#### 5. Detail Page Patterns\nProductionHub RecipeDetailsPage pattern:\n```tsx\n1. useParams to get ID\n2. useEffect to fetch detail (fetchRecipeById)\n3. Show loading/error/empty states\n4. Render header + sections with related data\n5. Return () cleanup dispatch (clearCurrentRecipe)\n```\n\n#### 6. State Management (Redux)\nAll apps follow consistent Redux pattern:\n```tsx\n// In store.ts\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  reducer: {\n    auth: authReducer,\n    feature1: feature1Reducer,\n    feature2: feature2Reducer,\n  },\n});\n\n// Slices use createAsyncThunk for API calls\nexport const fetchItems = createAsyncThunk(\n  \"items/fetchItems\",\n  async () => {\n    const res = await fetch(\"/.netlify/functions/items\");\n    return await res.json();\n  }\n);\n```\n\n#### 7. Form Patterns\nCommon across all modals:\n- Text inputs with `.form-input` class\n- Textarea with `.form-textarea`\n- Date inputs\n- Number inputs with min/step attributes\n- Form groups with labels\n- Validation: check required fields before enabling submit\n- Show loading state during submit: `{submitting ? \"Saving...\" : \"Save\"}`\n\n#### 8. Dropdown Patterns (Custom)\nConsistent implementation across CategoryFilter, RecipesHeader:\n- `useState` for open/closed\n- `useRef` for detecting outside clicks\n- `useEffect` with mousedown listener cleanup\n- CSS classes: `.custom-dropdown`, `.custom-dropdown-menu`, `.custom-dropdown-item--selected`\n\n---\n\n### Patterns Most Relevant to SalesCRM Needs\n\nBased on SalesCRM's spec requirements, here are the patterns that will be useful:\n\n**1. List Pages with Filtering** ✓\n- RecipesPage shows excellent pattern for ClientsListPage\n- Search + status/category filters + pagination all together\n- RecipesHeader component is reusable\n\n**2. Detail Pages with Sections** ✓\n- RecipeDetailsPage shows header + multiple content sections\n- CategorySection can organize clients by status\n- Good for ClientDetailPage structure\n\n**3. Modal Patterns** ✓\n- NewTransactionModal shows complex form with add/remove rows\n- Can be adapted for task/deal/attachment creation\n\n**4. Table Patterns** ✓\n- RecentTransactionsTable shows navigation links in tables\n- Edit/delete button patterns are consistent\n- Pagination shared component ready to use\n\n**5. Multi-section Layout** ✓\n- Accounting's AccountsPage uses CategoryGroup to group items\n- InventoryTracker's NavigationHeader shows simpler header approach\n\n**6. Responsive Navigation** ✓\n- Both sidebar (ProductionHub) and header nav (Accounting/InventoryTracker) available\n- Can choose based on design needs\n\n---\n\n### Missing Patterns (Not Yet Implemented)\n\nSalesCRM needs these patterns that aren't yet in the existing apps:\n\n1. **CSV Import/Export** - No import/export implementations found\n2. **Timeline/Chronological Feed** - No history/timeline components\n3. **Relationship Graphs** - No relationship visualization\n4. **Rich Text Editing** - No WYSIWYG components for writeups\n5. **File Attachments** - No file upload/attachment UI (though UploadThing is in tech stack)\n6. **Tag Management** - NewTransactionModal has tag input pattern, but could be extracted\n7. **Search Across Multiple Fields** - Current searches are simple substring matching\n\n---\n\n### File Structure Template for SalesCRM\n\nBased on existing apps, SalesCRM should follow:\n```\n/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/\n├── App.tsx                    # Router setup\n├── main.tsx                   # Entry point\n├── store.ts                   # Redux store\n├── hooks.ts                   # useAppDispatch, useAppSelector\n├── types/\n│   └── index.ts              # All TypeScript types\n├── pages/\n│   ├── ClientsListPage.tsx\n│   ├── ClientDetailPage.tsx\n│   ├── PersonDetailPage.tsx\n│   ├── DealsListPage.tsx\n│   ├── DealDetailPage.tsx\n│   └── TasksListPage.tsx\n├── components/\n│   ├── ClientListTable.tsx\n│   ├── ClientHeader.tsx\n│   ├── ClientDetailsPanel.tsx\n│   ├── DealCard.tsx\n│   ├── TaskCard.tsx\n│   ├── NavigationSidebar.tsx\n│   └── ...

Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me create a detailed report with all the findings:\n\n## Summary of ProductionHub, InventoryTracker & Accounting Implementation Patterns\n\nI've conducted a thorough analysis of the three existing apps. Here are my findings to help guide SalesCRM's development:\n\n### 1. SIDEBAR/NAVIGATION COMPONENTS\n\n**ProductionHub's Sidebar Approach:**\n- Uses **NavigationSidebar component** at `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/NavigationSidebar.tsx`\n- Displays app logo, navigation items, and user info at the bottom\n- Uses inline SVG icons for each nav item\n- Implements active state detection via `useLocation()` hook\n- Layout: sidebar + main content flexbox structure\n\n**Key Implementation Details:**\n- Hard-coded nav items array with path, label, and SVG icon\n- Uses `useNavigate()` for routing and `location.pathname` for active state detection\n- Footer section shows avatar and user name (currently hardcoded to \"A. Chen\")\n- No logout button visible in ProductionHub sidebar\n\n**Alternative Pattern (InventoryTracker):**\n- Uses **NavigationHeader** (top navbar) instead of sidebar\n- Has logo, horizontal nav links, and user info in top right\n- Uses same active state detection pattern\n\n**Accounting:**\n- Uses **NavBar component** at `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NavBar.tsx`\n- Top navigation bar with horizontal links\n- Includes \"New Transaction\" button and logout functionality\n- Uses useAuth hook to get user name\n- Has breadcrumb navigation below navbar\n\n**Sidebar CSS Reference:**\n- Location: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/layout.css` (lines 8-148)\n- Contains full sidebar styling including `.sidebar`, `.sidebar-header`, `.sidebar-nav-item`, `.sidebar-footer`, `.sidebar-avatar`, `.sidebar-logout-btn`\n- Reusable component: `/repo/apps/shared/layout/Sidebar.tsx` (lines 1-67) - generic sidebar component\n- ProductionHub implements its own custom NavigationSidebar instead of using the shared one\n\n### 2. ROUTING & APP.TSX PATTERNS\n\n**ProductionHub App Structure:**\n```\n- Routes wrapper with Route definitions\n- Sidebar layout using `.sidebar-layout` flex container\n- Main content area with Routes inside\n- Default route redirects to /recipes\n- Pattern: sidebar + main flexbox layout\n```\n\n**Accounting & InventoryTracker:**\n- No sidebar layout\n- Routes directly render at top level\n- NavBar/NavigationHeader at page level, not in App.tsx\n\n### 3. REDUX STORE PATTERNS\n\n**All apps use consistent store structure:**\n- Location of stores:\n  - `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/store.ts`\n  - `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/store.ts`\n  - `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/store.ts`\n\n**Shared Store Creation:**\n- Uses `createAppStore()` from `/repo/apps/shared/store/store.ts`\n- All apps include auth reducer: `import { authReducer } from \"@shared/auth/authSlice\"`\n- App-specific slices added per app (equipment, recipes, runs for ProductionHub, etc.)\n\n**Auth System:**\n- Shared auth slice: `/repo/apps/shared/auth/authSlice.ts`\n- Auth hook: `/repo/apps/shared/auth/useAuth.ts`\n- AuthState interface includes: `user`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`\n- AuthUser interface: `id`, `name`, `email`, `avatarUrl` (optional)\n- Actions: `setUser`, `clearUser`, `setLoading`\n- useAuth hook provides: `user`, `isAuthenticated`, `isLoading`, `login`, `logout`, `setAuthLoading`\n\n### 4. AUTH PAGES & PASSWORD FLOWS\n\n**Found Auth Pages:**\n- Accounting: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` - Very minimal, just a placeholder\n- No forgot password, reset password, or other auth pages exist in any app\n- Auth is currently mock-level (no real implementation)\n\n**Current Auth Limitation:**\n- LoginPage is empty scaffold\n- No password recovery flows implemented\n- All apps use hardcoded user data in sidebar/navbar\n\n### 5. CSV IMPORT/EXPORT FUNCTIONALITY\n\n**Result: NOT FOUND**\n- No CSV import/export functionality exists in any app\n- No `papaparse`, `csv-parser`, or similar dependencies\n- This is a feature SalesCRM will need to implement from scratch\n\n### 6. FILTER DROPDOWN COMPONENTS\n\n**Found: CategoryFilter & DateRangeFilter in InventoryTracker**\n\n**CategoryFilter Component:**\n- Location: `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/CategoryFilter.tsx`\n- Type: Custom dropdown (not form select)\n- Implements click-outside detection with `useRef` and `useEffect`\n- Selected item shown in trigger button\n- Uses CSS classes: `.custom-dropdown`, `.custom-dropdown-trigger`, `.custom-dropdown-menu`, `.custom-dropdown-item`, `.custom-dropdown-item--selected`\n- State: `isOpen` boolean\n- Props: `categories`, `selectedCategoryId`, `onChange` callback\n- Features: \"All Categories\" default option plus mapping of category items\n- No search functionality (important gap!)\n\n**DateRangeFilter Component:**\n- Location: `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/DateRangeFilter.tsx`\n- Renders popover with two date inputs\n- Uses modal pattern with \"Apply\" button\n- Temporary state (`tempFrom`, `tempTo`) until applied\n- Click-outside closes the popover\n\n**Custom Dropdown CSS Styles:**\n- Location: `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/index.css` (lines 714-789)\n- Classes: `.custom-dropdown`, `.custom-dropdown-trigger`, `.custom-dropdown-chevron`, `.custom-dropdown-menu`, `.custom-dropdown-item`, `.custom-dropdown-item--selected`\n- Trigger button shows 32px height with border\n- Menu is positioned `position: absolute; top: 100%; left: 0`\n- Items are 32px height with hover and selected states\n- Z-index: 100\n\n**Key CSS Features:**\n```css\n.custom-dropdown-trigger { height: 32px; gap: 6px; border-radius: 4px; }\n.custom-dropdown-chevron { transition: transform 0.15s ease; }\n.custom-dropdown--open .custom-dropdown-chevron { transform: rotate(180deg); }\n.custom-dropdown-item { width: 100%; height: 32px; transition: background-color 0.1s ease; }\n.custom-dropdown-item--selected { color: var(--accent-primary); font-weight: 500; }\n```\n\n### 7. IMPORTANT STYLING PATTERNS\n\n**Shared Design System:**\n- Location: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/` containing:\n  - `tokens.css` - color variables and typography\n  - `layout.css` - general layout patterns\n  - `common.css` - form controls, buttons, tables, badges\n\n**Button Classes:**\n- `.btn-primary` - accent color, height 32px\n- `.btn-secondary` - border style\n- `.btn-ghost` - transparent background\n- `.btn-danger` - error color\n\n**Form Elements:**\n- `.form-group`, `.form-label`, `.form-input`, `.form-textarea`\n- Input height: 36px\n- Focus state includes accent color border + shadow\n\n**Modal Pattern:**\n- `.modal-overlay` - fixed, full screen, semi-transparent background\n- `.modal-content` - max-width 720px, max-height 90vh\n- Z-index: 1000\n\n### 8. KEY FINDINGS FOR SALESCRM\n\n**Must Implement from Scratch:**\n1. CSV import/export functionality (Papaparse or similar)\n2. **Searchable filter dropdowns** - CategoryFilter has no search; SalesCRM needs enhanced version\n3.

Let me analyze what shared code SalesCRM needs and whether it should be refactored from existing apps or created new.\n\nThe skill says:\n1. One subtask to write/refactor shared code for app-wide logic: backend, reducers, auth, navigation.\n2. One subtask for each page to write/refactor shared code for each component on that page.\n\nLet me think about what SalesCRM needs that could be shared:\n\n**Already shared:**\n- Auth (authSlice, useAuth) - but SalesCRM needs more complex auth (inline sidebar auth, forgot password, reset password, email confirmation)\n\n\n- Store (createAppStore, hooks), Layout (Sidebar, AppLayout), Pagination, SearchableSelect, ConfirmDialog, Breadcrumb, CommentsSection, Date/currency utils, Backend db utilities, and Styles (tokens, layout, common) - though the sidebar will need to be more sophisticated to handle the inline auth form.\n\n**Potential candidates for sharing:**\n- CSV import/export functionality since SalesCRM specifies a shared ImportDialog component that other apps could reuse\n- Enhanced searchable filter dropdowns that SalesCRM needs with search capabilities built in\n\n, which could replace InventoryTracker's basic CategoryFilter\n- Auth pages like ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, and ConfirmEmail that could work across all apps\n- Timeline/activity feeds, tag management, and file attachments using UploadThing\n- Backend JWT verification middleware for consistent authentication\n\nLooking at what each app currently has, Accounting only has a placeholder LoginPage with no CSV or complex filtering, InventoryTracker has a basic dropdown filter but no CSV or auth pages, and ProductionHub uses a custom NavigationSidebar without leveraging shared components or CSV functionality.\n\nSupplierTracker hasn't been built yet, so I need to figure out which features are actually identical across apps versus which ones are app-specific. Auth is clearly a cross-cutting concern that all apps would benefit from, but SalesCRM's implementation is much more detailed than what the others need. CSV import/export is only explicitly mentioned for SalesCRM, though Accounting and InventoryTracker could potentially use it. The FilterSelect component could be shared and enhanced from InventoryTracker's basic version, and the sidebar navigation could be standardized across ProductionHub and SalesCRM rather than each building their own.\n\nLooking more carefully at what actually qualifies as shared code, I'm realizing that SalesCRM's inline sidebar auth form is pretty specific to that app, while the underlying auth slice is already shared. The FilterSelect component seems like the strongest candidate for shared code since it's a generic UI pattern. The CSV import/export was apparently designed as a shared ImportDialog component according to the AppRevisions notes. And the JWT verification middleware for Netlify Functions could definitely be shared across all the apps' backends.\n\nNow I'm mapping out what each SalesCRM page actually needs—the clients list needs tables, search, filters, pagination, and import/export capabilities; the client detail page needs headers, collapsible sections for tasks and deals, modals for interactions; the person detail page needs relationship tracking and contact history. Let me figure out which of these components already exist elsewhere and which ones need to be built from scratch. I'm listing out the shared components and utilities across these apps—FilterSelect needs refactoring since both InventoryTracker and SalesCRM need searchable filtering, ImportDialog is explicitly called out as shared, and CSV utilities for parsing and generating files would benefit multiple apps. But looking more carefully at SupplierTracker's requirements, while it has similar patterns with suppliers, documents, and lists, it doesn't actually overlap enough to justify extracting shared code right now. components on each page could be shared. For the app-wide logic, I've got the backend auth middleware and existing shared utilities already in place. Looking at ClientsListPage, I can extract a FilterSelect component from InventoryTracker's CategoryFilter, plus the ImportDialog that's explicitly mentioned as shared, while Pagination is already handled. ClientDetailPage could leverage the existing CommentsSection for timeline or notes functionality.\n\nConfirmDialog is already shared, and AttachmentsSection for file uploads and display could be reused across SupplierTracker as well. The pattern repeats across DealsListPage, TasksListPage, and ContactsListPage—they all need FilterSelect and ImportDialog. PersonDetailPage, SettingsPage, and UsersListPage are mostly app-specific, and while auth pages could theoretically be shared, no other app currently has them.\n\nSo the main candidates for extraction are FilterSelect for searchable filtering, ImportDialog for bulk data loading, and AttachmentsSection for document handling across multiple apps.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether these are actually needed everywhere. FilterSelect makes sense since InventoryTracker already uses dropdowns and ProductionHub could filter recipes by status, while Accounting could filter transactions. ImportDialog is explicitly shared within SalesCRM across entity types, and while other specs don't mention import/export, it's generic enough to be useful. CSV utilities would support both. Backend auth middleware is another candidate since all apps have auth reducers and JWT handling.\n\nActually, the skill is clear—when there are multiple apps, I should use `add-task` to break this into subtasks. SalesCRM's spec explicitly calls out a shared ImportDialog and custom styled dropdown components, so those are definitely worth extracting. I'll focus on the core shared pieces: backend auth middleware to handle JWT across apps, a reusable FilterSelect component built from InventoryTracker's CategoryFilter, the ImportDialog for CSV imports, and CSV utility functions.\n\nNow I'm wrestling with how to structure the subtasks. The skill says one per page for shared components, but FilterSelect and ImportDialog appear on multiple pages—ClientsListPage and DealsListPage both need them. I could create one subtask per component instead of per page, since refactoring FilterSelect once covers both places it's used. Let me map out what each page actually needs: ClientsListPage and DealsListPage both require FilterSelect and ImportDialog, while ClientDetailPage and PersonDetailPage already have their shared components, and DealDetailPage needs nothing new. So really I'm looking at extracting just those two components that span multiple pages. new beyond existing shared\n- TasksListPage needs: FilterSelect, ImportDialog (same)\n- TaskDetailPage needs: nothing new (CommentsSection already shared)\n- ContactsListPage needs: FilterSelect, ImportDialog (same)\n- SettingsPage needs: nothing shared\n- UsersListPage/UserDetailPage: nothing shared\n- Auth pages: could be shared but not clearly needed by other apps\n\nSo the main shared components are FilterSelect and ImportDialog, used across multiple list pages.\n\nI think the right approach is:\n1. One subtask for app-wide logic (backend auth middleware)\n2. One subtask for the list page shared components (FilterSelect + ImportDialog + CSV utils) - since these are the same across ClientsListPage, DealsListPage, TasksListPage, ContactsListPage\n\nWait, but the skill says \"one subtask for each page.\" Let me follow that more literally, but only for pages that actually need shared code. The issue is that if I create FilterSelect and ImportDialog in the ClientsListPage subtask, then the remaining list pages would have nothing to implement since they'd just reuse those components. That leaves me either with empty subtasks or needing to group the shared components separately. I think the practical solution is to create one subtask for app-wide logic like backend auth middleware, then one for the FilterSelect component and another for ImportDialog plus CSV utilities, since these are the actual reusable pieces across multiple pages. I'm realizing the shared code needs are pretty straightforward: app-wide backend auth middleware, plus a FilterSelect component and ImportDialog that multiple list pages will use, along with CSV utilities. But I should verify whether refactoring InventoryTracker's simple CategoryFilter into SalesCRM's more complex searchable FilterSelect is actually worth the effort, or if they're too different to meaningfully share.\n\nLooking at what each app actually needs—InventoryTracker has a basic dropdown for categories, while SalesCRM needs a searchable multi-option component used throughout filters and modals—they're conceptually similar but quite different in practice. I notice there's already a SearchableSelect component in the shared code, so I should check whether that already handles what SalesCRM needs before creating something new.\n\nOn the import/export side, I'm seeing that CSV functionality is unique to SalesCRM across all the apps, and the AppRevisions mention a shared ImportDialog but that's scoped within SalesCRM itself across different entity types, not across apps.\n\nNow I need to focus on what actually requires shared code across multiple apps. The backend auth middleware would be useful for any app using Netlify Functions, and I should verify whether the existing SearchableSelect component already has search capabilities or if it needs enhancement. Rather than continuing to analyze, let me just examine the key files directly and make a concrete

Let me analyze what shared code is needed for SalesCRM.\n\n**What already exists in shared:**\n1. Auth (authSlice, useAuth) - basic Redux auth state\n2. Store (createAppStore, hooks) - Redux store factory\n3. Backend db (getDb, query, queryOne, errorResponse, jsonResponse) - Neon DB utilities\n4. Layout (Sidebar, AppLayout) - basic sidebar and layout\n5. Components: SearchableSelect, Breadcrumb, ConfirmDialog, Pagination, CommentsSection, CategorySection\n6. Utils: date, currency, doubleEntry\n\n\n7. Styles: tokens, layout, common\n\n**What SalesCRM needs that could be shared:**\n\nI'm identifying a couple of key pieces that would benefit other apps. First, there's the JWT verification middleware that wraps all Netlify Functions—SalesCRM requires optional JWT verification, which is a pattern other applications could reuse. Second, I'm noticing that SalesCRM needs a FilterSelect component that's distinct from the existing SearchableSelect; while SearchableSelect works well for form inputs with search, FilterSelect functions more like a dropdown button with optional search for filtering through many options, similar to what InventoryTracker uses for category filtering.\n\nBeyond those, SalesCRM has an ImportDialog component that handles CSV imports with template downloads and validation, plus a generic CSV export utility. The ImportDialog is primarily SalesCRM-specific, but the pattern itself is generic enough that other apps might find it useful.\n\nLooking at what truly qualifies as shared across different applications, FilterSelect stands out as a genuine UI pattern that InventoryTracker and ProductionHub could both use. The backend auth middleware is universally needed for securing Netlify Functions. The ImportDialog and CSV export utilities are more specialized to SalesCRM's needs, though they could potentially be adapted elsewhere.\n\nSo I'm settling on three main subtasks: implementing the backend auth middleware for JWT verification across Netlify Functions, creating a reusable FilterSelect component that's more generic than InventoryTracker's current CategoryFilter, and building out the ImportDialog with CSV utilities. Rather than trying to refactor InventoryTracker's existing CategoryFilter, it makes more sense to write a new shared FilterSelect from scratch that can handle the broader requirements both apps need. Looking at which pages need what, I'm seeing FilterSelect and ImportDialog appear across multiple list pages—ClientsList, DealsList, TasksList, and ContactsList all need the same pattern. Since these components and CSV utilities are shared across so many pages, it makes more sense to bundle them into a single app-wide subtask rather than duplicating work across individual page subtasks. page. Let me group them:\n\n1. **App-wide shared logic**: Backend auth middleware\n2. **List page shared components**: FilterSelect + ImportDialog + CSV utils (used by ClientsListPage, DealsListPage, TasksListPage, ContactsListPage)\n\nActually, the skill says \"One subtask for each page to write/refactor shared code for each component on that page.\" So I should have one subtask per page. But the shared components are the same across pages.\n\nI think the practical approach is:\n- Subtask 1: App-wide shared logic (backend auth middleware)\n- Subtask 2: Write shared FilterSelect component (used by multiple pages)\n- Subtask 3: Write shared ImportDialog component and CSV utilities (used by multiple pages)\n\nOr I could combine subtasks 2 and 3 into one since they're both \"list page components.\"\n\nI'll go with the clearest grouping: one subtask for app-wide logic covering the backend auth middleware, and another for the shared list page components that get reused across ClientsListPage, DealsListPage, and the other list pages. Since these components are identical across pages, I don't need separate subtasks for each one.\n\nNow I need to check if any existing apps already have ImportDialog or CSV logic I should refactor. Looking back at my exploration, no CSV functionality exists anywhere currently, so I'm building this from scratch.\n\nThe skill also says to use add-task to unpack these into subtasks. Since there are other apps in the system, I should unpack rather than treat this as a standalone app.\n\nI'm thinking through what actually qualifies as shared work here. The backend auth middleware seems genuinely reusable across all apps, and FilterSelect is a UI component that multiple apps could benefit from. For the ImportDialog and CSV utilities, those are more specific to SalesCRM's needs right now, but they're still worth extracting as shared code since they follow a pattern that other apps might adopt later.\n\nSo I'll create three subtasks: one for the backend auth middleware, one for FilterSelect, and one for ImportDialog with CSV utilities. Each will reference the shared code skill path, and then I'm done—future workers will pick these up. for other apps, and the CSV utilities are generic enough to be useful too. Now I'm thinking about the task structure—according to AGENTS.md, all subtasks need to share the same skill, so I should create one task with the writeShared.md skill and break it into subtasks that actually do the writing work, not just planning. Each subtask should write or refactor shared code that can be used across apps. I'm grouping them as: write the backend auth middleware for Netlify Functions, write the FilterSelect component with search functionality, and write the ImportDialog plus CSV utilities. I see the issue now—I'm overcomplicating this by creating separate subtasks for each page when they all need the same shared components. Since FilterSelect and ImportDialog are used across ClientsList, DealsList, Tasks, and Contacts pages, I should consolidate into just one subtask for writing those shared components, plus one for app-wide logic like reducers and navigation. grouping approach. I'll create two subtasks: one for the shared backend auth middleware, and another for the FilterSelect, ImportDialog, and CSV utilities that all list pages need.\n\nLooking at ClientDetailPage though, it has sections like Tasks, Deals, and Attachments that could theoretically be reused across apps. But SupplierTracker would have completely different content—orders instead of deals, documents instead of attachments—so the layout pattern might transfer but the actual components wouldn't. Since SupplierTracker isn't even built yet, I should focus on what CRM actually needs rather than speculating about future apps.\n\nThe Sidebar in SalesCRM has an inline auth form that's pretty specific to that app, so that's not worth extracting as shared code. The base Sidebar component already handles nav items and user info fine.\n\nNow I'm wondering whether to tag these subtasks with the SalesCRM app name or leave them generic since they're shared code. Looking at the AGENTS.md pattern, tasks can have an --app flag, but for shared infrastructure like auth middleware and common components, I should probably keep them app-agnostic.\n\nActually, let me reconsider what genuinely needs to be new shared code here. The backend auth middleware is definitely new and necessary—all apps need JWT verification for Netlify Functions and there's nothing like that currently. FilterSelect is more questionable since it might already exist or be simple enough to implement per-app.\n\nImportDialog could be genuinely useful across multiple apps since SalesCRM needs it for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts. The CSV utilities would support that. But I'm second-guessing whether the auth pattern is really generic enough to share or if it's too specific to SalesCRM's optional mode and JWT handling.\n\nLet me check the AppStyle.md to see what the

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ca254283-9e3b-4262-9b55-038a3d781a39","uuid":"52af4c09-6dc4-4bb2-b2d7-e37f643cc7e4","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

Let me finalize my analysis and create the subtasks.\n\nBased on my analysis, the shared code opportunities for SalesCRM are:\n\n**App-wide shared logic:**\n1. **Backend auth middleware** - Optional JWT verification middleware for Netlify Functions. SalesCRM explicitly states \"All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\" This is backend infrastructure that all apps would benefit from.\n\n**Page-level shared components:**\nThe main new shared components needed are:\n1. **FilterSelect** - Custom styled dropdown with optional search for filtering. Used by ClientsListPage, DealsListPage, TasksListPage, ContactsListPage for status/tag/category filters. InventoryTracker has a basic CategoryFilter that could be refactored. \n\nThis is distinct from the existing SearchableSelect which follows an input-based pattern. I also need to pull out the **ImportDialog** component—a CSV import dialog with template download, column specification, file parsing, and validation error display that SalesCRM explicitly identifies as shared. Along with that, I'll extract the **CSV utilities** for parsing and generating CSV data for import/export. Since these components are used across the same list pages, I can group them logically together.\n\nNow I'm thinking through how to structure the subtasks for the add-task command. The shared components—FilterSelect, ImportDialog, and CSV utilities—are identical across all list pages, so it makes more sense to bundle them into one subtask for shared list page components rather than splitting them by page. That way I have one subtask for the app-wide backend auth middleware and another for all the shared UI components and utilities. I'm settling on two subtasks following the skill pattern: one for app-wide backend logic like the auth middleware, and another for the shared list page components including the FilterSelect dropdown, ImportDialog, and CSV utilities.\n\nSince the skill requires refactoring existing implementations into shared code, I should also update InventoryTracker's CategoryFilter to use the new shared FilterSelect component and remove the original implementation.\n\nNow I'm ready to set up the task with the writeShared.md skill and create subtasks for building the shared FilterSelect component and refactoring InventoryTracker to use it. I'm realizing the subtask descriptions are just that—descriptions for the future worker. The writeShared.md skill already contains the guidelines on how to execute the work, so the worker will have both the skill instructions and my subtask context. Let me verify my understanding: my job is to unpack the work into subtasks using add-task, not to actually implement the code myself. Once I've added the tasks, I should signal completion.\n\nNow I need to check the correct format for the app parameter—looking at the AGENTS.md example, it uses kebab-case like \"sales-crm\", but the instruction also says to use the directory name under apps/, which is \"SalesCRM\". Let me verify which convention applies

Let me analyze which shared code makes sense and create the appropriate subtasks.\n\nBased on my thorough analysis:\n\n**Existing shared code:**\n- Auth (authSlice, useAuth) \n- Store (createAppStore, hooks)\n- Backend db (getDb, query, queryOne, errorResponse, jsonResponse)\n- Layout (Sidebar, AppLayout)\n- Components: SearchableSelect, Breadcrumb, ConfirmDialog, Pagination, CommentsSection, CategorySection\n- Utils: date, currency, doubleEntry\n- Styles: tokens, layout, common\n\n**SalesCRM needs (beyond what's already shared):**\n\n\nI need to extract JWT middleware for Netlify Functions since SalesCRM requires optional verification and other apps like SupplierTracker would benefit from this pattern. I also need to build a FilterSelect component that's distinct from the existing SearchableSelect—this one opens as a button-style dropdown rather than an input field, and SalesCRM uses it throughout filters, modals, and detail pages.\n\nThe ImportDialog component with CSV utilities is another shared pattern SalesCRM explicitly needs, handling template downloads, column mapping, parsing, and validation alongside export functionality.
