Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips).

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":144,"startLine":1,"totalLines":144}}}

Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":133,"startLine":1,"totalLines":133}}}

Let me understand the structure:\n\n1. **Job 1 - CheckTestSpecClientDetailPage**: Check testSpec.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage test entries\n   - I need to look at the ClientDetailPage section in tests.md and check it against the testSpec.md directives.\n\n2. **Job 2 - CheckComponentsClientDetailPage**: Check writeApp.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage components\n   - I need to look at the ClientDetailPage components and check them against the writeApp.md directives.\n\n3. **Job 3 - CheckTestsClientDetailPage**: Check writeTests.md directive violations in ClientDetailPage tests\n   - I need to examine the ClientDetailPage Playwright tests against the writeTests.md directives.\n\nLooking at the ClientDetailPage structure in tests.md, I can see it includes several key sections: a ClientHeader with name and status information, QuickActions buttons for various tasks, a SourceInfoSection with acquisition details, and a TasksSection displaying unresolved tasks.\n\nThe remaining sections cover deals, attachments, people, and a timeline feed showing various events. However, I notice the ClientDetailPage section only has a placeholder comment indicating test entries will be added later by PlanComponent jobs—there are no actual test cases defined yet. This appears to violate the testSpec.md requirements, which expect concrete test entries rather than deferred implementation.\n\nNow I'm starting Job 1 to validate the ClientDetailPage against the testSpec directives. I need to systematically check every visible element—navigation, buttons, sections, interactive controls—and ensure each has a corresponding test entry that specifies exact navigation targets or action results for clickable elements, plus data mutation outcomes for any user actions that modify state.\n\nLooking at the ClientDetailPage section in tests.md, I notice there are no actual test entries listed, just a placeholder comment about future jobs adding them. This is a significant gap given the directives require comprehensive coverage of every element and interaction. Let me check the AppSpec to understand what this page should actually contain.\n\nBefore diving deeper, I should verify whether there are already component files and test suites for ClientDetailPage that might give me a clearer picture of what needs testing.","signature":"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

[2026-02-24T03:47:39.159Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01MEoVxj9g9DNzLZfswthpJA","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear picture. Let me check the ClientDetailPage section of tests.md more carefully. From lines 315-328:\n\n```\n## ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n\n### Components\n- ClientHeader (name, type badge, status badge, tags with edit pencil icon)\n- QuickActions (Add Task, Add Deal, Add Attachment, Add Person buttons)\n- SourceInfoSection (Acquisition Source, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired, Edit button)\n- TasksSection (unresolved tasks list with checkboxes, due dates, linked deals)\n- DealsSection (deal entries with name, stage, value)\n\n\n```\n\nSo the ClientDetailPage has components listed but **NO test entries**. This is a massive violation of the testSpec.md directives. Every component and interactive element should have test entries.\n\nThe remaining sections—AttachmentsSection, PeopleSection, and TimelineSection—are also documented but completely lack corresponding test cases, which means the test coverage for this page is severely incomplete.\n\nNow looking at the actual ClientDetailPage.tsx implementation, it's extremely bare-bones: it only displays the client name and includes a ClientTasksSection, while missing the ClientHeader, QuickActions, SourceInfoSection, DealsSection, AttachmentsSection, PeopleSection, and TimelineSection that should all be present.\n\nFor the CheckTestSpecClientDetailPage job, I need to verify against the testSpec.md directives. The first major violation is that there are no test entries at all—just a placeholder comment—when the spec explicitly requires systematically inventorying every visible element, column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section with a test entry for each. The second violation is that clickable elements lack test entries specifying their exact navigation targets or action results. The third violation involves missing test entries for any user action that mutates data. The actual ClientDetailPage component is quite bare—it only renders the name and ClientTasksSection, but tests.md lists seven separate components that don't exist as individual files. Looking at the writeApp.md requirements, there are multiple violations: inline JSX needs to be extracted into separate components, most of the expected UI sections are missing entirely, and the attachment functionality isn't implemented.\n\nThere's also no Playwright test file for ClientDetailPage at all, just a placeholder comment in tests.md. The most critical fixes needed are implementing the missing components (ClientHeader, QuickActions, SourceInfoSection, DealsSection, AttachmentsSection, PeopleSection, TimelineSection) and creating comprehensive test coverage for all eight sections.\n\nSince these gaps stem from ClientDetailPage never being fully built out, I should group related fixes together. Let me check the mockup to understand the full scope, though I'll need to work around the fetch limitations for external URLs. create groups that match the strategy's approach. The ClientDetailPage is essentially unbuilt beyond a skeleton, so I need to organize the work in phases: test specifications first, then component implementation, then Playwright tests. According to the strategy, I should use add-group to create fix groups for each violation rather than fixing them directly.\n\nThe root cause is that the page was never fully completed, which means I need multiple dependent tasks. Looking at the pattern, I should create fix groups that follow the original build sequence—one for the test spec, one for the components, and one for the tests—since each phase depends on the previous one. I'm realizing the cleanest approach is to organize the fix groups around the three violation types: one for adding missing test entries, another for building the missing components, and a third for writing the Playwright tests.

The page just has an inline `<h1>`.\n2. QuickActions - **MISSING**: No component file exists.\n3. SourceInfoSection - **MISSING**: No component file exists.\n4.

The ClientTasksSection only shows task title text without checkboxes, due dates, deal links, or priority badges.\n\n4. **\"Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads\"** - **VIOLATION**: No attachment functionality exists.\n\n5. **\"When building modals that reference other entities, use a searchable select/dropdown component\"** - **VIOLATION**: No modals exist for the QuickActions (Add Task, Add Deal, Add Attachment, Add Person).\n\n6. **\"When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component\"** - Cannot be satisfied since there are no test entries.\n\n7. **\"Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (p-6 max-sm:p-3)\"** - This IS met in the existing page.\n\nLet me also check for backend support."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":250,"cache_read_input_tokens":68334,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":250,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f067b6db-6ecb-4904-b6fd-1eda7bfa0b11","uuid":"a930fe8c-31e0-40c7-9cc3-de80b5594e44"}

The schema has tables for all the sections needed by ClientDetailPage:\n- `clients` - has source, campaign, channel, date_acquired fields\n- `tasks` - can be linked to clients\n- `deals` - linked to clients\n- `attachments` - linked to clients and deals\n- `client_individuals` - join table for people\n- `timeline_events` - linked to clients\n\nBut there are NO backend functions for:\n- Deals (no deals.ts)\n- Attachments (no attachments.ts)\n- Timeline events (no timeline.ts)\n\nAnd the client detail page only uses `/clients/:clientId` and `/tasks?client_id=X`.\n\n\nI'm also checking what test coverage exists for the ClientDetailPage, and there's nothing — no Playwright tests at all. The writeTests.md directives require tests that verify navigation targets and side effects, but there's no test file to work with.\n\nSince there are no test entries in tests.md either, this gap makes sense — the ClientDetailPage components were never fully specified. I need to create test entries for all the subcomponents: ClientHeader, QuickActions, SourceInfoSection, TasksSection, DealsSection, AttachmentsSection, PeopleSection, and TimelineSection.\n\nLooking at the writeApp.md violations, most of these components are either missing entirely or severely underdeveloped — TasksSection lacks checkboxes and due dates, the main page has inline JSX instead of proper component structure, and there are no backend functions for deals, attachments, timeline, or source info. The writeTests.md gap is straightforward: no Playwright tests exist for this page at all.\n\nSince all these issues stem from the ClientDetailPage never being fully built out, I should group the fixes by what needs to be created together rather than treating each component separately. in order: test entries first, then components, then Playwright tests.\n\nLet me create appropriate groups:\n\n1. A group for writing all missing test entries for ClientDetailPage in tests.md\n2. A group for building ClientDetailPage components and backend\n3. A group for writing Playwright tests\n\nActually, looking at how the strategy works, I should follow the existing build strategies. The fix groups should use the checkDirectives strategy. Let me think about the right grouping.\n\nFor the test entries, I'll create groups that follow the testSpec pattern - one fix for adding all test entries.\nFor the components, I'll create groups for building each component.For the tests, I'll create a group for writing Playwright tests.\n\nLet me be more specific. Given the scale, I'll organize this into four fix groups: one for test entries, one for building all the ClientDetailPage components and backend pieces like ClientHeader, QuickActions, SourceInfoSection, DealsSection, AttachmentsSection, PeopleSection, TimelineSection, and enhancing ClientTasksSection, one for Playwright tests, and one final group to run tests and verify everything works.","signature":"EssgCkYICxgCKkAPhn52pyILZH0kunHmT8SW0U/ywKI0v3ScNoMFxogqQq86ZT6tgDEqtCg1DU7iZ32BQJtuneXEqbdHMtMxBuVZEgwjELwg7oEFtjzg67oaDOCRqGnaKjYB2fbAnyIwSeREDg0lWFppgem8tylcKiKB8eKSTfmea8O2vCEhJs09CUk3VRDIPEcw8dz7b0nNKrIfxwc/532O66H8AY6sWUyoarhha9BXGmS/5yBjBFUUWZ/JbsocQw/yUbl2XWkBgWcjeRxtw/PQHJk+RMI2Lx4jQa6pIu4ybNtUTkJsT+fbTc+QcXLN+GX8m3hVaqzZYqCbSy/zlZfm/LfJ/bJ2IRE5XMYf2ZOUOW4i3z70TulG41G9XRW7p9uj0L/+TpKLV2dQHETkdAaGN63F5I376wTSRZe47w1Nqfz2w6P90SVJn4jkC2VuPIo255EAG+IO0kqe+7hbNEmWwBgwUHBkeaE1uDnrdsw3Uv4kZ/DO5IvAO2GiRsDy+fz2F3/LKbGxGE037J4uNFqJbDqcpDZgv6uHoMRcz6jzITuzNcnKysvZU5cHKQ9fVghP68hnrzc+3XVzvxAkRy+Tx0hZWXa9DlBnjPJm4up++NK9Zkmyx7pmmbU5/ivdQs4Co80JXeHxtmGWg+gdVWwPPzFV0o1swxxbypFiHhmM//Bb6ta5IJveyy9W1SUBEb/JU2LLaMJpeV9s3lnA2RJP8LyoDrsbtKYM1OOtnV/LyCxbCOxfRORe5jr1/aHy3z9ysOYPeR3pmB+i2kC0YGhYJtFhLcmow8SndsVg6bzamqszMDcKfC83BKLO9CdfwD8Uycuo5ipK8WnrKHUJVnYCZsS+YBnXuX4b6fEKTxHDDa/NdFxNJwIxsriQSaZJBAvRom8kUx2nSGUKHGflb7HprXs9pcJZgkCBY59jbQXet/G8Zxsh/vnohxhE2Vh7VS5bpuwnRrMNYVE+7EzK4KE7zGkFC/Z4xwRdPaE1Ix0sRhbssk/d990mvNkjwFSQ2YduvTSVVLyNaCIFMvYM+g7lSGsS4u9DgO5DkUgeexQR7/pGNLwaWET/1siSEeNv7OwT9hzM2+a4EW8lqoezCqeQvdRfX71BVOMIBXb0pLXDfTkPSYhbZMO3BwBdKZHX58rwjglsiJ8clGCHF6KVNuD0X8l65zOJZ1NStXmdIkkEUmvMuTLYLCibsUHbZ2jeXxAhiQKZzp/nA80CZ+K0B6vGJ8OjVQNMe4Afi/boGgvLdaw/xfZ+1zbEaHp8HcrsUG8bTWxCtSOdD0e57+hcctqBIUTFtIyCvcwp9lm1v8I8SOiqE8IlyE10lrpv7p2RM7ooTm8rWc/OR6OrRy2uh88qFW1+P2xOkwhJbOhc5kt8cNtBK17z8DubVMBF/s19TM07xZMFrVa77Hu59IB/JC6hyiLT//JwFSjTCNaigJDEgQWIUaxZZJv2xvI/Wzqk6+17UQPGo4FuFZqijPdo2ys1690mn1rkn5Q277fXo1OIyGZwi0eBoMO5RGj+BimM+QB7UnMYHY0qnvQDMVzWtIi0mGgyGocs5SbJEEdzxpUGbjNz3HcoZ7a5UYz1+TnHFu+19gLwpcQj+IF7fGb/4OUGH7gAbfuDsNi5k5xlclbFXqoYZlvx8oC+OUvh+P56Z61NO9pbTGxZx0UUuZ/b7CLwEARwzhNQLrg8eFITenZn79xEp1OpdijOL8ygVcmxaVfKyrJ+qk+B+PBtkfxd7zJMfitzSCYP23fK2R/gA/JdhbBYPhYd5bQvLUp/bMjixQLU8r+7B82VLpmURlJKLVQLIKBp0GWECUMMPf5y+tqfjgKpT+o6JPYqLW3idxnAr5S9QYfkMK8mNN6eRGJAOhZw71MNHC4gWtY8PZXoWneeUMCZGdtefoymQkEbmdwY14AAh2vXz+Titze1SqjtKSnEA290RQEgNNPomqB8jdmb5sTqjNNnNuSOrQHWE/tYpPrSwK0/r6rJsFZP8df/VvcYEb6k7RHBRbW4Szc6dA0YD3xgCSONM+6orc1EXxUWagjCCMWFc9J6NWcjZxL0UsTPPLdMISGlxv0K50EbsLbsHDg8V3uTvL06c2/UDMEkHHTv7D7eHUwKp8FEe6Rzxj7zNf3I1po5KZg1pRkRJqlLgggQUeq7zWFR61OtoKcj0V6ydpGxif1fz9HdTgFUMEIcWRgbEMgimS4Co13ILUfm95r2aeidswvg5MJChRNz/D5YVJLr0xXgE6pCpKrnXsxAJDhWEc3nSLay3IvUFQahQ0gcaYlX4xbSu+Z5xw9E/6AVpG8BCZjPp8uRc/SnNXkztvNLl81ue5q4KDe6tjY57zxrXBsxt2TTKBRI2SI7Ys99WP++tzFv7/ovDB3qqcEGM0lemSSqakXjfWU8Fhk6kP4mD/2Oh+j/jzAQNputD9c4FWUErwG5Quv8KjTc2eRxOLiWoXQzRboWnE6fUC0isOa7oFfGu3ZITPA6zl0dRJkp2zL/xlvW3rpoUsg9dDD608sCNTQOUvZJxXFRuQLGWsB9unHG+g4P7uGpiJ4e4Crb7s/GxBb0N/nbfv63kqJItYUa1hwlyIz2T6Y7gVHocnJlRPhjAdgIvldvVfnCXEbA8u6cP/D23IjinjLFc9WpfRyZGjSVb/zReTxXDk9JKtNd+vMZl4zbQ+bfXDKFDIk7r0YCnAzShlaa8S/rt5cPDIC4l0zP5JjpuUn++TqFH5ilXflS6saBeP525mywcfa3wLX1X9TdL8daH9Hmc/RGYshMjE8GWOdlO0Pb7wwIgzNzv0F+u7rrLvmW0gGjTWytSbGWuI/aSpGrwRotdHtfs/qFF6RjSQbk2YVZiELyN84AnxzrRzD4cQ0FhYyE4b1M8R9MV0UW+WuLdfgwCrSGlGMipAzot1KAWDurISbXQ+44pGc4BdUWdt3FRkwh783pYxGhKvTkX4D5P+ARRNEzLCh/S6WyKcWk+iVB59YnZYq0j05Ry5S3aur6e7MDRPbKs6xZaHonM99WExLhOEF7wfmUlbm3yI0Kvj0zgdc5U6VgJzm1ewl5V2stX5FMWl35Zp2cA+xvoWqSgoIgnZBaza3tGTimg+ro5nFXPakVSIG7QvXi1mvZmrPxvJNhFAwMob8uiZWx4Pdrrx651WVHPSnCGpJMOWQ2rJaA6WrJCrJnN5wuRKZOGKrYUFUEhcqFomRvn+zeFLdWsn0KwNHbGruR0MfyExsINJb3i8sCf2alvZ/6+ZdwFZCvAb8tuxTyk9yzqrkOnwfQqs4ZSbhXeRA7LEAuf6pj5/Mwb/IKM6vPzCI5REPpf+y3Cv3BRHwLY0M4SMsL8UPoupEPPv3nAI2Og8b5Y0vandcUvsHasnfVIjpqNdkVP75b2P37xw78Q4t4jbDpc/RJyEJhGc2hmAtz9c+um2PWLncuf3FW7Xtvtf5+6FHEQL/eJowYtOP1r7bdWQC8rgA3j1az0IlA24yB82NAxL5/Lfj0e489wj+/j4E8aBsaBdAFgchXZbdtHbl7MgmHhJNG7sFExgNPQlbRLklykcksHUXEUsYhSw2aJkvcc7TH2vhiTxxoClfZGh5U0q0HqlAJJqtaJCtZ4ooKf102Ui2ZmF8/Gzcyb8Alwvx4H3aXkVAHA6jRgsuZKPwbrHfLjf0h+/WNisGlgH4NRyhfEdA/Xq9xOWMt2bT6GrfbiNYiKAg3uXErectnpWmMBg/OSk8qjTHUd8aD8vD8BNbl8OZuHCBMoEEoaUIyVE4J/yD3N2Hvz3gALTLVMDT7BZuZD1XwaollVM7QJzP2QM9+GZNwnTtDt9lU1oOrBKqfDUAfGIlrjPj9PrElVeMxq8joQ935yuuccbs99YH7N3vm2VgCA/cru49VTENPTCYMdqotc6y10WuyRNm+TXp54yXaVtaQmTlIngkQUk7QvTQldp72FAVhtBfXDJAGqI1jRv17Xffu0v8uhwD/iSNp6I2oq0OIAhQzgbOBZJzNaNfaj856/0YgFGGUpw65P2dFGhaDCkRf4caUy2w2Xd9xzyM/RtpM36aNk94yv/ouVZjEvF0iEsM8OMgJuI+YH3ezYswcfUSOIawdcEKbROjmvft5JHoVHW+FY9ISzmcg9fTy6n4mEFrjrlwEw/jHYJMIoxu83jh55k6WUIGkA4rRkcSHfR4C9vZdnRWi4fOeXS4C3VATnH/qqgKHb9tG6YU31/LceUk2wD+VehS2QgF7AA2ufrzEv+NNiFGvHahVv3mOcodgCkA/Yf+kiQrq9T7oxXELJyIL/Hset9JHNhv8QSxz/wHFs+UjtJj9yrhHLskojs0LEYcDiAelRbTBAVxIzccaziCppMEx+iIHaQB0jJfutjkuNSakJ5bruoDNPBo7W5GLACEyV74OT5shAP/s9whqZM5GXpXE+ywHch4BJPzfdt/DxVOjeZL+yyKT6RF1/PbAXDWX/l6ELy6iFSVjxg3yofHkKde4F/IyMmvGVgjd9tmrthiqmpHMPp78GtVQvPxC0pdYpW0uKXIYsuQzmIhxglyC6l3nb2GVQVO9ufvWk1erXNkl/68M3xELPcVPrVkjgkfowTDywOoB9yHwp2GC3C6/CyQDNq5dsdrCqC0vl/iii4VNs5KyAxNN0ovEUBk4XK/4Kc4jdOzy9d79Yfy8gwHDZ2t7JMRnL+9tYPswdJRl1iHdDKXwgic1Jyega5LAxihv2tBveM9K7cRgp0D40DXyqLB9Gi3Ju0H5u2lJEAW0gLTgo1rY+vRENnBgz2iQkU68dpgp2jdM1pgaJ3taEN+2PKKohZi8jXOIOpFGpfAuB99bo4BLWQz9v5fVtinvvOTMa33bHFbXFnfQgQduUiUejY4ezSJBi3GrwgtWXLf36RiO3WUIfCZmQzsiERe/meOOfFtie5UD/vCcgHGOuVnFNtsQ17y12jLBMj5NmuV/dz+WyhTMsMzVTFF7bJdX43uWHQQIv6lQ8ta
