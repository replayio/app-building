on the Dashboard page\n- When: The user clicks the \"Transactions\" navigation link\n- Then: The app navigates to /transactions (TransactionsPage)\n\n**Test: Navigation link for Settings navigates to Settings page**\n- Components: NavigationHeader\n- Given: The user is on the Dashboard page\n- When: The user clicks the \"Settings\" navigation link\n- Then: The app navigates to a settings page\n\n**Test: Active navigation link is visually highlighted for the current page**\n- Components: NavigationHeader\n- Given: The user is on the Dashboard page (/)\n- Then: The current page's navigation link (or the app logo/name) has a visually distinct active state (e.g., different color, underline, or bold)\n- When: The user navigates to /accounts\n- Then: The \"Accounts\" link becomes visually highlighted\n\n### LowInventoryAlerts\n\n**Test: Low inventory alerts section displays with heading and warning icon**\n- Components: LowInventoryAlerts\n- Given: There are materials with quantities below their reorder point\n- Then: The \"Low Inventory Alerts\" section displays with a warning icon and the heading \"Low Inventory Alerts\"\n\n**Test: Each low inventory alert shows severity, material name, current quantity, and reorder point**\n- Components: LowInventoryAlerts\n- Given: \"Steel Bolts M6\" has current quantity 150 units and reorder point 200 units\n- And: \"Aluminum Sheets\" has current quantity 25 kg and reorder point 100 kg\n- And: \"Copper Wire\" has current quantity 80 m and reorder point 150 m\n- Then: Each alert row shows a severity indicator icon (Warning or Critical triangle icon)\n- And: Each alert shows the severity label (\"Warning\" or \"Critical\")\n- And: Each alert shows the material name, current quantity with unit, and reorder point with unit\n- And: \"Aluminum Sheets\" is marked as \"Critical\" because its quantity is far below the reorder point\n- And: \"Steel Bolts M6\" and \"Copper Wire\" are marked as \"Warning\"\n\n**Test: Low inventory alert View Details link navigates to material detail page**\n- Components: LowInventoryAlerts\n- Given: A low inventory alert is displayed for \"Steel Bolts M6\"\n- When: The user clicks the \"View Details >\" link on the \"Steel Bolts M6\" alert\n- Then: The app navigates to the MaterialDetailPage for \"Steel Bolts M6\"

The user clicks the \"Dismiss\" button on the \"Copper Wire\" alert\n- Then: The \"Copper Wire\" alert is removed from the alerts list\n- And: The other alerts remain visible\n- And: The dismissal is persisted so the alert does not reappear on page reload (until inventory changes again)\n\n**Test: Low inventory alert Reorder button opens new transaction pre-filled for reorder**\n- Components: LowInventoryAlerts\n- Given: A low inventory alert is displayed for \"Steel Bolts M6\"\n- When: The user clicks the \"Reorder\" button on the \"Steel Bolts M6\" alert\n- Then: The app navigates to the NewTransactionPage (/transactions/new) or opens a new transaction modal\n- And: The transaction form is pre-filled with \"Steel Bolts M6\" as the material to reorder\n\n**Test: Low inventory alerts section shows empty state when no materials are below reorder point**\n- Components: LowInventoryAlerts\n- Given: All materials have quantities at or above their reorder points\n- Then: The \"Low Inventory Alerts\" section displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No low inventory alerts\") or the section is hidden\n\n### MaterialsCategoriesOverview\n\n**Test: Materials categories overview
