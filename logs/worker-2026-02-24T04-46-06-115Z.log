selects \"Referral\" from the Source dropdown\n- **Then** only clients whose source is \"Referral\" are shown\n- **And** the Source dropdown displays \"Source: Referral\"\n\n#### Test: Sort dropdown changes table ordering\n- **Given** the Clients List Page is loaded with multiple clients\n- **When** the user selects \"Recently Updated\" from the Sort dropdown\n- **Then** clients are ordered by most recently updated first\n- **When** the user selects \"Name A-Z\" from the Sort dropdown\n- **Then** clients are ordered alphabetically by name ascending\n- **When** the user selects \"Name Z-A\" from the Sort dropdown\n- **Then** clients are ordered alphabetically by name descending\n\n#### Test: Multiple filters combine correctly\n- **Given** the Clients List Page is loaded with clients\n- **When** the user selects \"Active\" from the Status dropdown\n- **And** the user selects \"Enterprise\" from the Tags dropdown\n- **Then** only clients that are both \"Active\" AND have the \"Enterprise\" tag are shown\n- **When** the user additionally types \"Acme\" into the search bar\n- **Then** only \"Active\" clients with \"Enterprise\" tag whose name/tag/contact matches \"Acme\" are shown\n\n#### Test: Clearing search resets the filter\n- **Given** the user has typed \"Acme\" into the search bar and the table is filtered\n- **When** the user clears the search bar (backspace or clear icon)\n- **Then** all clients are shown again (subject to any active dropdown filters)\n\n### ClientsActions\n\n#### Test: Import button opens import dialog\n- **Given** the user is on the Clients List Page\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Import\" button (with download icon)\n- **Then** an import dialog/modal opens\n- **And** the dialog shows instructions for the expected CSV format including required columns (Client Name, Type, Status) and optional columns (Tags, Source, Primary Contact)\n- **And** the dialog provides a file upload area accepting .csv files\n\n#### Test: Import dialog processes valid CSV file\n- **Given** the import dialog is open\n- **When** the user uploads a valid CSV file with correctly formatted client data\n- **Then** the dialog shows a preview of the clients to be imported with row count\n- **When** the user confirms the import\n- **Then** the new clients appear in the clients table\n- **And** a success message is shown (e.g., \"X clients imported successfully\")\n- **And** the import dialog closes\n\n#### Test: Import dialog can be cancelled\n- **Given** the import dialog is open\n- **When** the user clicks the Cancel button or closes the dialog\n- **Then** the dialog closes without importing any data\n- **And** no new clients appear in the table\n\n#### Test: Import dialog rejects invalid file\n- **Given** the import dialog is open\n- **When** the user uploads a file that is not a CSV or has missing required columns\n- **Then** the dialog shows an error message describing the issue (e.g., \"Missing required column: Client Name\")\n- **And** the import does not proceed\n\n#### Test: Export button downloads client data\n- **Given** the Clients List Page is loaded with clients\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Export\" button (with upload icon)\n- **Then** a CSV file containing all current clients is downloaded\n- **And** the file includes columns: Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source, Primary Contact, Open Deals, Next Task\n\n#### Test: Export respects current filters\n- **Given** the user has filtered the clients table (e.g., Status: Active)\n- **When** the user clicks the \"Export\" button\n- **Then** the exported CSV contains only the filtered clients, not all clients\n\n#### Test: Add New Client button opens creation dialog\n- **Given** the user is on the Clients List Page\n- **When** the user clicks the \"+ Add New Client\" button (blue primary button)\n- **Then** a modal dialog opens with a form for creating a new client\n- **And** the form includes fields: Client Name (required text input), Type (Organization/Individual radio or dropdown), Status (dropdown: Active/Inactive/Prospect/Churned), Tags (multi-select or tag input), Source (dropdown or text input)\n\n#### Test: Add New Client form validates required fields\n- **Given** the Add New Client dialog is open\n- **When** the user leaves the Client Name field empty and submits the form\n- **Then** a validation error is shown on the Client Name field (e.g., \"Client name is required\")\n- **And** the form is not submitted\n\n#### Test: Add New Client form creates a client successfully\n- **Given** the Add New Client dialog is open\n- **When** the user enters \"New Corp\" as Client Name, selects \"Organization\" as Type, selects \"Prospect\" as Status, adds tags \"SaaS\" and \"Startup\", and selects \"Referral\" as Source\n- **And** the user clicks the submit/save button\n- **Then** the dialog closes\n- **And** the new client \"New Corp\" appears in the clients table with the correct Type, Status, Tags, and Source\n- **And** a success message is shown (e.g., \"Client created successfully\")\n\n#### Test: Add New Client dialog can be cancelled\n- **Given** the Add New Client dialog is open and the user has entered partial data\n- **When** the user clicks the Cancel button or closes the dialog\n- **Then** the dialog closes without creating a client\n- **And** no new client appears in the table\n\n### ClientsTable\n\n#### Test: Table displays all column headers\n- **Given** the Clients List Page is loaded\n- **Then** the table shows column headers: Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, Open Deals, Next Task\n- **And** each row has a \"...\" action menu on the right side\n\n#### Test: Client Name column displays client names as clickable links\n- **Given** the table shows clients\n- **Then** each client name is displayed as a clickable link\n- **When** the user clicks on a client name (e.g., \"Acme Corp\")\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for that client\n\n#### Test: Type column displays Organization or Individual\n- **Given** the table shows clients of both types\n- **Then** organization clients display \"Organization\" in the Type column\n- **And** individual clients display \"Individual\" in the Type column\n\n#### Test: Status column shows color-coded badges\n- **Given** the table shows clients with different statuses","numLines":200,"startLine":1,"totalLines":1851}}}

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings.

Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":133,"startLine":1,"totalLines":133}}}

Let me work through each one.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecPersonDetailPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in PersonDetailPage test entries\n\nLet me check the testSpec.md directives against the PersonDetailPage test entries in docs/tests.md:\n\n**Directives from testSpec.md:**\n\n1. **Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.**\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.**\n   \n3. **Don't swap in simpler elements just because they're easier to build — if the mockup shows specific columns with joins or computed values, test all of them, and if there are four filter controls shown, test all four rather than just the easiest ones.**\n\n4. **Every clickable element needs a clear navigation target or action result specified in the test entry, with no ambiguity about where buttons lead. For external flows like OAuth or payments, document exactly how they open and what happens when complete.**\n\n5. **Any user action that changes data needs to be tested for its full effect and persistence.**\n\n6. **Button appearance — text, icons, styling — should match the mockup exactly, not just verify that a button exists.**\n\n7. **Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they function correctly.**\n\n8. **File uploads should be supported unless the mockup indicates otherwise.**\n\n9. **Import and upload dialogs must clearly show the expected data format and accepted values before the user attempts anything, with test entries confirming this documentation is visible.**\n\n10. **Any backend integrations the user can configure — webhooks, APIs, OAuth apps — need complete setup instructions visible right in the configuration UI.**\n\n11. **State management and persistence need to be verified.**\n\nState-changing actions require tests confirming that other parts of the app update in response. If there's a timeline or history feature, every mutation it tracks must create a history entry atomically to prevent duplicates from re-renders, and I need to think through every field that could change and whether it needs tracking. For relationships that are symmetrical or reciprocal, like contact connections or mutual links, creating or updating one side must automatically sync the other side, and tests should verify both sides stay in sync.\n\nNow I'm going through the PersonDetailPage test entries systematically. Looking at the PersonHeader tests, the first couple check that the person's full name displays prominently and that title and client associations show up. pipe separator, client names.\n3. \"Header displays email with mail icon\" - OK, specifies icon + email.\n4. \"Header displays phone number with phone icon\" - OK, specifies icon + phone.\n5. \"Header displays location with location pin icon\" - OK, specifies icon + location.\n6. \"Header displays associated clients as clickable links\" - OK, specifies \"Associated Clients:\" label, clickable underlined links, comma-separated.\n7. \"Associated client link navigates to client detail page\" - OK, specifies exact navigation to /clients/:clientId.\n8. \"Each associated client link navigates correctly\" - OK, specifies navigation for second client.\n\nPersonHeader looks complete and well-formed. No obvious violations.\n\n### RelationshipsSection test entries (lines 757-837):\n1. \"Relationships section displays heading with icon\" - OK\n2. \"Relationships section shows Graph View and List View tabs\" - OK\n3. \"List View displays relationship entries with all details\" - OK, specifies format of entries\n4. \"Relationship entry Link navigates to the related person's detail page\" - OK\n5. \"Each relationship Link navigates to the correct person\" - OK\n6. \"Switching to Graph View tab\" - OK\n7. \"Switching back to List View from Graph View\" - OK\n8. \"Filter button is displayed in Relationships section\" - OK\n9. \"Filter button opens filter options for relationships\" - OK\n10. \"Add Entry button is displayed in Relationships section\" - OK\n11. \"Add Entry button opens relationship creation form\" - OK, specifies searchable select for Related Person\n12. \"New relationship entry can be created successfully\" - This one tests creation AND checks the reciprocal relationship, verifying that when you add a relationship it automatically creates the reverse entry as well.\n13. \"Add Entry form validates required fields\" - OK\n14. \"Add Entry form can be cancelled\" - OK\n15. \"Relationships section shows empty state when no relationships exist\" - OK\n\nNow I'm noticing a gap in the filter testing. The spec requires filtering by both type and client, but the test only covers filtering by type. I need to check if there's a dedicated test for client filtering or if this is an actual gap in coverage.\n\nLooking at the RelationshipsSection component, it only implements type filtering, not client filtering. So either the component is incomplete or the test spec is missing a test entry for client filtering. The spec language is clear about supporting both, so this seems like a test coverage issue.\n\nMoving on to the ContactHistorySection tests, I'm checking entries 1-3 which cover the heading display, chronological ordering with proper formatting, and the beginning of what looks like additional display requirements. I'm noticing a mismatch between the spec and the actual implementation—the Team Member field is supposed to be a required search/select component, but in the code it's just a plain text input without validation or the required indicator. for interactionType, summary, contactDate).\n\nWait, but the test spec entry says Team Member is \"required\". Looking at this:\nLine 893: \"Team Member (required, search/select)\"\n\nBut the implementation uses a plain text input, not a search/select. This is a violation of the testSpec.md directive: \"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\"\n\nActually wait, this is about whether the test SPEC (the docs/tests.md file) is violating the testSpec.md directives. The test spec says \"Team Member (required, search/select)\" at line 893. That seems correct per the spec. The violation would be in the component (job 2) and tests (job 3) if they don't match this.\n\nLet me focus on the testSpec.md directives themselves for this first job. The key ones are: consistent styling and navigation, inventorying every visible element, not substituting easier elements for what's specified, ensuring every clickable element has an exact navigation target, verifying that mutating actions persist and trigger side effects, checking button appearances, thoroughly testing modals, handling attachments and file uploads, documenting import/upload formats, setting up backend integrations, and confirming state changes propagate through the app.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test spec entries properly verify side effects and state propagation. For relationship creation, the spec correctly tests that a reciprocal entry appears on the other person's page. But I don't see test entries for deleting or editing relationships—only adding them. Let me scan through all the relationship-related test entries to see what's actually covered. I'm noticing the directives specifically call out that reciprocal relationships need testing for creating, updating, AND deleting—with both sides staying in sync. The test spec covers creating a relationship and verifying the reciprocal side updates, but there's no test for deletion to confirm the reciprocal side also gets deleted. This seems like a gap against the stated directives. The filter specifications look solid—relationships can be filtered by type or client, and contact history by interaction type or date range. Now I'm reviewing the AssociatedClientsSection test entries to see if they adequately cover the expected functionality like displaying client cards with proper status indicators.\n\nLooking at the overall test spec directives, I need to check whether PersonDetailPage includes all required components like sidebar navigation. The ClientsListPage spec mentions sidebar navigation in its components list, so I should verify if PersonDetailPage has the same coverage. The sidebar being app-level means it only needs testing once, not on every page, so that's fine. Looking at the test coverage systematically, the spec accounts for all visible elements described in the Components section—PersonHeader, Relationships, ContactHistory, and AssociatedClients all map to their corresponding test entries. The clickable elements all specify their exact navigation targets, and I need to verify that mutating actions persist and trigger the expected side effects.\n\nThe relationship creation test checks for the reciprocal relationship, contact history tests verify persistence of new and edited entries, and the modals are fully tested for opening, validating, saving, and cancelling. Button styling and icons are covered. I'm noticing the state-changing actions section checks that creating a relationship triggers the reciprocal check, but I should verify whether editing relationships also updates other parts of the page.\n\nLooking at the delete functionality gap—the RelationshipsSection doesn't have a delete button at all, which might be a missing feature since the requirements mention that complete apps need create/delete buttons, and the directives specify that deleting one side of a reciprocal relationship must update the other side. I'm uncertain whether this absence violates the requirements or if it's acceptable since the app spec itself doesn't include delete functionality. So the directive specifically requires that if delete operations exist, the tests must verify both sides of reciprocal relationships are updated. The creation test does check both sides, but I need to determine whether the directive mandates a delete test or just says that *if* deletion happens, it must be tested. The wording \"creating/updating/deleting\" suggests these are all expected operations that need verification if they're part of the app. The directives explicitly require testing for deleting reciprocal relationships and verifying both sides stay in sync, which is a clear violation since the test spec lacks this. I should also verify whether deleting contact history entries needs testing, though that's not explicitly required by the reciprocal relationship rule. rocal behavior), but the Requirements say you need delete buttons. Let me see if there's a delete test for contact history... No, there is not. The contact history has create, edit, and cancel tests, but no delete test. This is a requirements violation (not a directives violation per se).\n\nLet me also verify more carefully about what the AppSpec might say. I don't have it loaded, but the test spec was written based on it. The test spec components description lists \"edit icon\" for contact history entries but doesn't mention a delete icon or button.\n\nOK so to summarize Job 1 findings:\n\n**Potential Violations:**\n\n1. **Missing delete relationship test entry with reciprocal verification** - Directive: \"If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships, creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\" The test spec has creation with reciprocal check but no deletion test.\n\n2. **Missing delete contact history test entry** - This is more of a requirements violation than a directives violation. The requirements say to add delete buttons for a complete app.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether this is actually a directives violation. The testSpec.md directives section is what I need to check against, and the first clear violation is the missing reciprocal deletion test. But I should be conservative here—let me verify if the AppSpec actually defines delete functionality for these sections. The AppSpec shows what the mockup displays, so if there's no delete button in the mockup, maybe the spec is correct in omitting the test. However, the requirements explicitly state that adding necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app, including create and delete buttons. This seems like a genuine directive violation about ensuring reciprocal relationships are fully tested.\n\nLet me move on to Job 2 now and check the PersonDetailPage components against the writeApp.md directives.\n\nThe key requirements I need to verify are: test entries match the component implementation, visual design matches the mockup without simplification, all interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes, monorepo apps include the correct base path in netlify.toml, database queries use tagged template literals with the neon serverless driver, empty strings convert to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns, Netlify Functions parse resource IDs from the correct path index, and modals use searchable dropdowns instead of plain text inputs for entity relationships.\n\nNow I'm checking the PersonDetailPage component to ensure it has consistent padding on the root element and verifying that all child components are properly integrated.\n\nLooking at the Header component, I can see it includes proper test IDs across all relevant elements, uses SVG icons for contact information, and implements clickable navigation for associated clients without any native select elements.\n\nI need to verify that the modals follow directive #8 about searchable select components for entity references. The AddRelationshipModal correctly uses a searchable input with clickable options rather than a plain text ID field, and I'm checking whether the ContactHistoryFormModal follows the same pattern.\n\nThe Team Member field in ContactHistoryFormModal is currently a plain text input, but the test spec specifies it should be a \"search/select\" component. I'm trying to determine if this violates the directive—team members might not be separate database entities like persons are, but the test spec clearly expects search/select functionality rather than plain text input.\n\nLooking at the validation logic, there's another mismatch: the spec marks Team Member as required, but the form's handleSubmit() only validates interactionType, summary, and contactDate—team_member isn't checked as required, and the field label lacks an asterisk indicating required status.\n\nI'm also checking for native HTML select elements across the components. The PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, and AssociatedClientsSection all use custom dropdowns rather than native selects, which aligns with the directive. The ContactHistoryFormModal does use a native datetime input, which technically isn't a select element, so that might be acceptable depending on the directive's intent.\n\nNow I'm verifying the padding on PersonDetailPage and then moving into checking the backend for neon driver usage and URL parsing. I should also cross-reference the test spec against the components to ensure all the required data-testid attributes are present, starting with RelationshipsSection.\n\nGoing through the RelationshipsSection test IDs—everything from the section itself through the modal, search functionality, dropdowns, and error states all have their corresponding testids in place. Now checking ContactHistorySection. Finished verifying all the test IDs for the contact history and associated clients sections. Now I need to check the backend functions that support the PersonDetailPage to make sure they're not violating any of the writeApp.md directives.\n\nLooking at the filter implementations more closely, I'm noticing some gaps between what the spec requires and what's actually built. The Contact History filter only handles interaction type filtering, but the spec calls for filtering by both interaction type and date range. The Relationships section has a similar issue—it filters by type but not by client as specified. These are both directive violations.\n\nI'm also tracking a problem with the ContactHistoryFormModal where the Team Member field is just a plain text input instead of a searchable select component, which doesn't match the spec requirements or directive #8.\n\nLet me map these violations back to the specific writeApp.md directives to be precise about what's actually broken. I'm realizing these filter violations show up in both the test spec and the components—the spec is correct but the components don't implement it, so Job 2 would catch these issues while Job 1 wouldn't. Now I need to check the backend functions for violations around the neon driver, empty strings, and path parsing, plus review the netlify functions and look for the PersonDetailPage component in the src/components directory.\n\nLooking at the file structure, I notice PersonDetailPage.tsx appears in both pages/ and components/ directories, which is odd since the router imports it from pages. I should verify whether the components version is actually being used or if it's just leftover code.\n\nBut more importantly, I need to focus on the backend functions and whether they support what the spec requires. Let me check the netlify endpoints for individuals, relationships, contact-history, and clients to see what's actually implemented.\n\nI'm identifying clear spec violations now: the delete relationship test is missing verification for reciprocal deletion, the ContactHistorySection filter doesn't support date range filtering as specified, the RelationshipsSection filter lacks client filtering capability, and there's an issue with the Team Member field in ContactHistoryFormModal.\n\nLooking back at the reciprocal relationship directive more carefully—it explicitly mentions \"creating/updating/deleting\" all need reciprocal verification. The test spec does verify the CREATE with reciprocal checking, but there's no DELETE test that confirms both sides stay in sync when a relationship is removed, which is a clear gap.\n\nFor Job 2, I should focus on the PersonDetailPage React components themselves rather than the backend functions, since there's likely a separate backend validation job. Scanning through the findings, the ContactHistorySection is missing date range filtering support even though the spec calls for filtering \"by interaction type or date range,\" and I'm still reviewing what else the RelationshipsSection might be missing.\n\nThe ContactHistoryFormModal has a Team Member field that's currently a text input, but the spec expects \"search/select\" functionality. While the writeApp.md directive about searchable selects specifically targets entity references and IDs, the spec violation here is clear—the component doesn't match what was specified.\n\nNow moving into Job 3 to check for writeTests.md directive violations in the PersonDetailPage tests. I'm reviewing the test guidelines from writeTests.md and now going through the person-detail.spec.ts file to check each test against these directives. Starting with the PersonHeader tests and verifying that the \"Header displays person's full name prominently\" test uses proper locator strategies and follows the assertion patterns outlined in the guidelines.\n\nThe next few tests for title/client associations, email with icon, and phone number with icon all follow similar patterns with getByTestId locators and proper assertions, though I notice the email and phone tests hardcode specific values rather than pulling from the API response data, which could be a brittleness concern worth flagging.\n\nThe associated clients tests verify both rendering and navigation behavior—checking that the links display correctly and that clicking them routes to the appropriate client detail pages using the URL assertion.\n\nNow I'm moving into the RelationshipsSection tests and checking how that component displays its heading with an icon.\n\nLooking at the List View test more closely, I notice it's only verifying the name, type, and link button, but the spec actually requires displaying the full relationship entry format including the person's title and their client or company name. The current test is missing those assertions.\n\nThe Link navigation test checks that clicking the link takes you to the correct person's detail page and verifies the URL and name are correct.\n\nLooking at the remaining tests, they're all passing their basic checks—the Graph View tab switching works, filtering and adding entries are functional, and the UI elements display as expected.\n\nBut I'm noticing a critical gap in the \"New relationship entry can be created successfully\" test. It verifies the relationship appears on the current person's page, but it never checks whether the reciprocal relationship was actually created on the other person's profile. The spec explicitly requires this bidirectional verification, and the test is missing that assertion entirely.\n\nMoving through the other tests, the \"Add Entry form validates required fields\" and \"Add Entry form can be cancelled\" tests look solid. The empty state test for relationships also checks out by using Jane Doe as a person with no relationships.\n\nFor the ContactHistorySection tests, the heading and icon display test passes, but the chronological log entries test has a problem—it verifies the content of the entries but doesn't actually check that they're ordered in reverse chronological order like the spec requires. The test is missing that ordering validation.\n\nThe remaining tests for interaction types, team member roles, and the edit icon all check out. The edit save test changes the summary and confirms the update, though it seems like there might be something else missing there.\n\nMoving through the cancel, filter, and add entry tests—they're all passing their checks. The new entry creation test verifies all the form fields are visible and successfully creates an entry.\n\nHowever, the spec requires a success message to be shown, but the test doesn't verify this. It's a potential gap, though the entry appearing could be considered implicit confirmation. The validation test uses a class-based selector instead of testid, which goes against the directive to prefer testids, but since the errors lack individual testids this is a minor issue. The cancel form test passes, and I'm now looking at the empty state test which uses Jane Doe as the test user.\n\nMoving into the AssociatedClientsSection tests, the heading with icon test passes. The client cards test verifies icon, name, status, industry, and view button. However, the status and industry tests both use conditional visibility checks with `if (await globexCard.isVisible())` rather than proper assertions, which is a weak pattern. The view client detail button test is cut off but appears to be checking navigation.\n\nLooking at the remaining tests, they verify URL navigation with a regex pattern for client IDs, handle the empty state correctly, and test navigation for each button. The key violation I'm finding is in the \"New relationship entry can be created successfully\" test—it doesn't verify the reciprocal relationship that should be created on the other person's profile, which violates the directive about asserting both primary and side effects. I'm finishing up my review of the directives and confirming the ones that don't have violations. Now I'm organizing all the issues I found across the three jobs into clear violation groups so I can report them systematically. , let me think about whether to group some of these as related fix tasks.\n\n- Violations 2.1 and 2.2 are both about filters not matching the spec. They could be grouped.\n- Violation 1.1 (missing delete test spec entry) and 3.1 (missing reciprocal check in test) are related to the reciprocal relationship handling.\n\nActually, looking at this from a fix perspective:\n- Violation 1.1: Need to add delete relationship test entries to docs/tests.md\n- Violation 2.1: Need to add date range filter to ContactHistorySection component\n- Violation 2.2: Need to add client filter to RelationshipsSection component\n- Violation 2.3: Need to make team_member required in ContactHistoryFormModal\n- Violation 3.1: Need to add reciprocal verification to the test\n\nNow I'm organizing these into logical fix groups. The reciprocal relationship issues should be grouped together since they're addressing the same underlying problem—adding test documentation and verification logic for reciprocal relationship creation. The filter implementations are similar in nature but affect different components, so they might warrant separate fixes. The team member validation is its own isolated issue.\n\nLet me create three fix groups that are appropriately scoped and manageable. I'm weighing whether to merge the reciprocal relationship violations since they're conceptually linked but come from different sources—one's a test code issue and the other's a missing test spec entry. Combining them would mean handling both the test documentation and the actual test implementation plus the delete functionality in one job, though they could also be split if keeping them separate makes the work clearer. new tests for delete relationship\n\nThat's actually quite a lot. Maybe I should keep them separate. But the tip says to group related tasks with the same root cause. The root cause here is incomplete reciprocal relationship handling.\n\nOK, let me create the groups. I'll combine the reciprocal issues and keep the filter and validation ones separate.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The violations I found:\n\nFor the \"New relationship entry can be created successfully\" test not verifying reciprocal relationship - this is both a testSpec directive issue (the test spec does describe it) and a writeTests directive issue (the test doesn't implement it). The fix would be to update the test code to verify the reciprocal side.\n\nFor the missing delete relationship - this is a testSpec directive issue (no test entries for delete + reciprocal check). The fix would be to add test entries, implement the delete functionality in the component + backend, and write tests\n\nThese are related but quite different in scope. Let me separate them. I'll group the reciprocal verification fix separately from the delete functionality work, and handle the filter and validation issues as their own tasks. I'm consolidating the reciprocal relationship issues into one group since fixing the delete functionality will naturally address the creation test verification. Then I have separate groups for the filter implementations and team member validation.\n\nNow I'm double-checking whether I should examine the Netlify backend functions for violations, but since the job focuses on PersonDetailPage components, I'll stick with just the React component violations. Let me verify the Contact History form modal requirements one more time to make sure I'm addressing everything correctly.\n\nLooking back at the spec, the Team Member field needs to be both a searchable select component and marked as required, but I'm realizing there's a dependency issue—I don't see a team members API endpoint available in the backend, which would be necessary to populate the searchable select.\n\nThe pragmatic approach here is to flag this as a violation since the spec calls for search/select functionality while the current implementation uses a plain text input, and let the fix task determine whether to add the backend endpoint or adjust the implementation. This is a writeApp directive violation where the component doesn't match the specified behavior.\n\nNow I need to verify the file structure more carefully. The explore agent listed PersonDetailPage.tsx in both the pages and components directories, which seems odd. Let me check the actual components directory listing to see what files are actually
