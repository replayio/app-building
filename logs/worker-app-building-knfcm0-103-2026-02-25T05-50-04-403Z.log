Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly.

Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route.

Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6a12af07-599f-4dd1-9ee8-ae3a983b92b8","uuid":"24f7108f-c4d7-4872-8590-66c3a71d2e7e","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports. Budget information is visible or accessible for each account, including an overall budget for the account and budgets for specific items (for example, big or notable expenses), potentially displayed as inline indicators or links to more detailed budget views.\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdjq4Pw1UektSnylW57BEZobPcKpDY4LHifIMz\n     9→\n    10→2.

The layout consists of the account name and category (asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense) at the top, followed by a transaction list or ledger. Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n    15→   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_0132NEpVoEnznhh8ZBfHZMrY","session_id":"6a12af07-599f-4dd1-9ee8-ae3a983b92b8","uuid":"86cc2d76-ea9c-4c81-8f35-9db39b84c1bb"}

Let me also check the mockup for the AccountDetailPage and the App.tsx routing.\n\nLet me now plan and implement each component. I have a good understanding of:\n\n1. The test specification for AccountDetailPage\n2. The existing patterns (NavBar, AccountCard, etc.)\n3. The Redux slices (accounts, transactions, budgets, reports)\n4. The CSS styling system (tokens, common, layout)\n5. The app-specific index.css\n\nLet me start writing the components:\n\n### 1. AccountHeader Component\nFrom the test spec:\n- Displays \"Account: <name>\" as the page heading\n\n\n- Shows \"Category: <category>\" below\n- Breadcrumb navigation (e.g., \"Page / AccountDetailPage\")\n- \"New Transaction\" button that opens NewTransactionModal\n- Search bar that filters transactions and can be cleared to restore all transactions\n\n### 2. BudgetOverview Component\nFrom the test spec:\n- Shows \"Budget Overview\" heading\n- Displays \"Actual: $X / Budgeted: $Y\" with \"X% used\" on the right\n- Horizontal progress bar that fills proportionally and changes color to warning/red when nearly exceeded, otherwise normal color when under budget\n\n### 3. Trans\n\nNow I'm looking at the TransactionsTab component, which displays a table with Date, Description, Amount, Direction, and Actions columns. The transactions are sorted by date in descending order, with \"View/Edit\" links in the Actions column and Direction showing either \"Debit\" or \"Credit\". The component handles tab switching between Transactions and Budget Details, and shows an empty state when there are no transactions.\n\n### 4. BudgetDetailsTab Component\nFrom the test spec:\n- Budget line items with name and actual vs budgeted amounts\n- Progress bar for each line item\n- Over-budget items have red/distinct color\n- Shows all budget categories for account\n\n### 5. ReportingLinks Component\nFrom the test spec:\n- \"Reporting\" heading\n- \"Actual vs Budget Report\" link\n- \"Transaction History Report\" link\n- Links navigate to CreateReportDialog\n\nNow I need to put together the AccountDetailPage, which serves as the main container with the NavBar, AccountHeader, BudgetOverview, and the two tabs for Transactions and Budget Details, plus the ReportingLinks section at the bottom. The page fetches account data, transactions, and budgets when it mounts. I'll follow the existing codebase patterns and write all the components together since they're independent of each other. Let me also check what shared components are already available to avoid duplication.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7165,"cache_read_input_tokens":67097,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7165,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6a12af07-599f-4dd1-9ee8-ae3a983b92b8","uuid":"928d10d7-ef93-4f35-9e1b-3ab646005651"}

Let me just proceed based on the detailed test specification which gives me all the information I need about the AccountDetailPage layout.\n\nNow let me write the components. I'll create all 5 component files and the page file. Let me start writing them in parallel.\n\nLet me plan the structure:\n\n**AccountHeader** - `src/components/AccountHeader.tsx`\n- Props: account, searchQuery, onSearchChange, onNewTransaction\n- Renders: breadcrumb, account name/category, search bar, New Transaction button\n\n**BudgetOverview** - `src/components/BudgetOverview.tsx`\n\n\n- Props: budgetAmount, budgetActual\n- Renders: heading, amounts, percentage, progress bar\n\n**TransactionsTab** - `src/components/TransactionsTab.tsx`\n- Props: transactions, accountId\n- Renders: table with Date, Description, Amount, Direction, Actions\n- Has View/Edit functionality that opens NewTransactionModal\n\n**BudgetDetailsTab** - `src/components/BudgetDetailsTab.tsx`\n- Props: budgets (Budget[])\n- Renders: list of budget line items with progress bars\n\n**ReportingLinks** - `src/components/ReportingLinks.tsx`\n- Props: account\n\n, accountId\n- Renders: \"Reporting\" heading with two links\n\n**AccountDetailPage** - `src/pages/AccountDetailPage.tsx`\n- Uses useParams() to extract the account ID from the route\n- Fetches account data, transactions, and budgets on mount\n- Manages tab state and search filtering\n- Renders all sub-components with proper data flow\n\nNow I'm writing out all these components, making sure to add test IDs, follow the existing CSS patterns, use the formatCurrency utility, leverage the Redux slices, and maintain the forest green color scheme throughout.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":900,"cache_read_input_tokens":76930,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":900,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6a12af07-599f-4dd1-9ee8-ae3a983b92b8","uuid":"bc8349c7-ede7-43e2-9f3c-de65b1ef50a9"}

I need to either:\n1. Update CreateReportDialog to accept those optional props\n2. Or simplify ReportingLinks to not pass those props\n\nLooking at the test spec:\n- \"Actual vs Budget Report\" link: \"navigates to the CreateReportDialog or generates a report pre-configured to show the Actual vs Budget comparison for the 'Main Checking' account. The report type is set to 'Budget vs Actual' and the account is pre-selected.\"\n- \"Transaction History Report\" link: \"navigates to the CreateReportDialog or generates a report pre-configured to show the Transaction History for the 'Main Checking' account. \n\nThe report type is set to 'Detailed Transactions' and the account is pre-selected.\"\n\nSo the CreateReportDialog should be pre-configured when opened from ReportingLinks. I'll update CreateReportDialog to accept optional default values for the report type and account name.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2061,"cache_read_input_tokens":80987,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2061,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6a12af07-599f-4dd1-9ee8-ae3a983b92b8","uuid":"f73f79ff-e604-43a0-8973-545ff17b5c4c"}

This is because `transactions.filter((txn) =>` - the filter callback's parameter isn't typed. But `transactions` should be `Transaction[]` from the store... Let me check the types more carefully.\n\nActually, the `Transaction` type import is unnecessary if the store already returns `Transaction[]`. The issue might be related to how the type flows through.\n\nLet me look at the actual error - `txn` on line 52 has implicit `any` type. This could be because the `transactions` selector might not be properly typed. Let me check.\n\nLooking at transactionsSlice, the state type is `TransactionsState` with `items: Transaction[]`. \n\nThe selector `s.transactions.items` should return `Transaction[]`, so the filter callback should properly type `txn` as `Transaction`. I need to check the store configuration to see if there's a type issue there.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":435,"cache_read_input_tokens":98070,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":435,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6a12af07-599f-4dd1-9ee8-ae3a983b92b8","uuid":"5dd58ec9-8aca-4105-8f87-f7f4c23997e0"}

BudgetOverview** (`src/components/BudgetOverview.tsx`) — Shows \"Budget Overview\" heading with actual/budgeted amounts, percentage used, and a progress bar. Bar color changes: green (normal), warning/gold (80-99%), red (100%+).\n\n**3. TransactionsTab** (`src/components/TransactionsTab.tsx`) — Displays a data table with Date, Description, Amount, Direction, and Actions columns. Transactions sorted by date descending. Direction shows as styled badges (\"Debit\"/\"Credit\"). \"View/Edit\" link in Actions opens NewTransactionModal. Shows empty state when no transactions exist.\n\n**4.
