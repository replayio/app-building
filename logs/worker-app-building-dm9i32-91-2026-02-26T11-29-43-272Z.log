No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly.

Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs).

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch.

Let me systematically work through the three subtasks.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage\nI need to check testSpec.md directives against the SupplierDetailsPage test entries in docs/tests.md.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n\n3. I shouldn't swap in simpler elements just because they're easier to build — if the mockup shows a table with columns requiring joins or computed values, I need to test all of them, and if there are four filter controls shown, I test all four rather than just the easiest ones.\n4. Every clickable element needs a test entry that specifies exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers, with no ambiguity about destinations. For buttons opening external flows like OAuth or payments, I need to document how the flow opens and what happens when it completes.\n5. Any user action that changes data needs its own test entry.\n6. I also need to verify that data mutations persist correctly and that side effects happen exactly as expected — like history entries being created once per action, not duplicated.\n7. Button and control appearance matters too — if the mockup specifies particular text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that appearance exists, not just that some button is there.\n8. Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they work properly.\n9. File uploads should be supported unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n10. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format upfront, and tests should verify that format documentation is visible to users before they attempt the import.\n11. Backend integrations that users can configure — webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps — need complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n12. State-changing actions must have...\n\nNow I'm looking at the SupplierDetailsPage section of the tests file to see how it's structured — it has SupplierOverview, DocumentsTab, CommentsSection, and OrdersSection.

Let me systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in SupplierDetailsPage test entries\n\nI need to check the test entries in docs/tests.md for the SupplierDetailsPage section (lines 336-557) against testSpec.md directives.\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n1. Consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element - write a test entry for each one\n3. Do not substitute easier elements for what the mockup shows\n\n\n4. For every clickable element, specify the exact navigation target or action result\n5. For data mutations, verify change is persisted correctly and side effects occur (exactly once)\n6. Button/control appearance matters - verify specific text, icons, or styling\n7. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must have tests for other parts updating\n\nNow I'm going through the SupplierOverview entries starting at line 344 to see if they align with these requirements. The first entry about displaying the supplier name looks compliant.\n\nThe remaining entries cover displaying the address, contact info, description, and status badge with proper color coding, plus a back button that navigates to the dashboard. The edit dialog test is solid—it verifies the modal opens with pre-filled values, allows editing the phone field, and confirms the changes persist, which satisfies the modal testing directive.\n\nFor the delete functionality, the spec correctly includes a confirmation dialog and verifies the supplier is removed from the list, covering the mutations directive. Moving into the DocumentsTab section, I'm checking that document cards display the file name in bold along with type and upload date, and the search functionality works correctly with proper clearing behavior.\n\nNow I'm verifying the upload dialog - it opens a file picker and lets users specify the document type before confirming the upload, which satisfies the file upload requirement. Since this accepts any file type rather than enforcing a specific format like CSV imports would, the format directive doesn't apply here. The view and download actions are straightforward - opening documents in a new tab and downloading them respectively.\n\nMoving through the comments section, the header displays the count correctly, comments appear in reverse chronological order with timestamps and authors, and new comments get added at the top with the current date and user info while clearing the input field and incrementing the count. The section collapses and expands as expected, and empty comments are properly validated. All persistence requirements check out.\n\nFor the orders section, I'm confirming the upcoming and historical tabs display correctly with the proper columns and data populated.  The order ID links navigate to the right details pages, search functionality works across both tabs, and status filtering is applied correctly. Status badges show the appropriate colors in both upcoming and historical orders, and switching between tabs functions as expected.\n\nNow I need to verify what test entries exist for the SupplierDetailsPage section. I'm noticing the page description mentions three tab links for Documents, Comments, and Orders, but I don't see a corresponding test entry that validates these tabs are actually displayed or functional. This seems like a gap in the test coverage for that feature. I'm noticing that the top-level tab links (Documents, Comments, Orders) on the SupplierDetailsPage don't have dedicated test entries to verify they scroll to their respective sections—they're only mentioned in the section header as descriptive text. This seems like a gap since directive 2 requires every visible interactive element to have a test entry, and these tabs are clearly interactive navigation elements. Looking more carefully, I realize the Edit Supplier modal on SupplierDetailsPage only has one test entry covering the basic open and edit flow, but it's missing cancel button and validation tests that follow the pattern established by the Add New Supplier dialog. The Upload Document dialog has the same gap—just an open test with no cancel or validation coverage. Given directive 7's requirement to completely test modal dialogs, these gaps need to be addressed. I'm reconsidering whether the tab links are actually violations—they're described in informational text rather than as separate test entries, and since the sections themselves are all tested and visible, this feels relatively minor. Let me focus on the clearer issues instead. I'm also noticing that the Edit Supplier entry doesn't explicitly verify persistence after a reload or navigation away and back, which seems inconsistent with how other persistence tests are written in the spec. Looking back at the test patterns across the dialogs, I see the Create Supplier tests cover opening, saving, cancel, and validation as separate entries, but the Edit Supplier test bundles most of that into one entry and skips the cancel and validation cases entirely. The Upload Document test similarly only covers the happy path. So I need to flag that Edit Supplier is missing dedicated Cancel and Validation test entries to match the completeness standard set by Create Supplier.\n\nOn the tab links, the spec explicitly calls them interactive elements that scroll to sections, yet there's no test entry for actually clicking those tabs—only tests for the sections themselves being visible. And looking at the full page layout, while individual sections are tested, there's no single test verifying all four sections exist and are visible together on the page as described in the spec.\n\nNow I'm moving to Subtask 2 and checking the writeApp.md directives to see what violations exist there.\n\nLooking at the components, I can see SupplierDetailsPage has the correct padding applied and proper data-testid attributes, while SupplierOverview is using a custom dropdown instead of the native select element for filters, which aligns with the directives.\n\nDocumentsTab implements file-type-specific icons for different document formats and handles actual file uploads through a hidden input with a ref, plus it uses a custom dropdown for the document type selector. Now I need to verify SupplierCommentsSection follows the same patterns.\n\nOrdersSection also has the required data-testid attributes and uses the shared FilterSelect component for status filtering. I'm noticing that none of these components have JSX comments next to their interactive elements documenting which test entries exercise them, which appears to be a requirement from the test specification. I see the testSpec.md requirement clearly now—every interactive element needs a JSX comment listing which tests exercise it. Looking through all the components I've reviewed, none of them actually have these comments, which means there's a systematic gap between what the spec requires and what's currently implemented.\n\nThis feels like it might be an aspirational requirement added after the components were written, or perhaps it's a lower priority compared to other violations. Since adding JSX comments is really a writeApp concern rather than a testSpec one, I'll note it but shift focus to the more concrete, actionable issues. Let me now check the writeApp.md directives more carefully, particularly around data-testid attributes in the components.\n\nLooking through SupplierOverview.tsx, I can see the interactive elements are properly instrumented with test IDs—the edit and delete buttons, navigation, modal controls, form inputs, status dropdown, and action buttons all have the right identifiers. Now I'm checking DocumentsTab.tsx for similar coverage. I'm verifying the remaining test IDs across the document deletion button, upload modal, and comments section components to ensure complete test coverage.\n\nNow I'm checking the OrdersSection component for its test IDs—the section itself, tab navigation, upcoming and historical tabs, plus search inputs, filters, tables, and status badges all have proper identifiers. Everything looks good so far.\n\nMoving on to verify that components follow the layout-agnostic pattern without padding on their root elements. SupplierOverview's root div has no inline padding, which is correct. The other components like DocumentsTab, SupplierCommentsSection, and OrdersSection also appear to have clean root elements without padding utilities, though I should verify their CSS files to be thorough. The parent SupplierDetailsPage handles the layout by wrapping each section in a card container with body styling, so the padding responsibility is properly delegated.\n\nNow checking for the native HTML `<select>` directive across all components. The SupplierOverview edit modal uses a custom dropdown, DocumentsTab's upload modal uses a custom dropdown, and OrdersSection uses the FilterSelect component, so there are no native select elements anywhere. That directive is satisfied.\n\nLet me examine the CSS files to catch any other potential violations I might have missed. checking the padding consistency across SupplierDetailsPage—it should follow the `p-6 max-sm:p-3` pattern throughout. Let me verify the main container and sections are using this consistently.\n\nNow moving to the test file validation. I need to check if the tests properly verify navigation behavior by asserting the URL or confirming the page content changes after clicking tabs, which is what writeTests.md requires. across multiple pages, tests must interact with it on each page\n3. For side effects, verify both primary effect and the side effect. Assert side effect happens exactly once.\n4. Avoid `getByText()` with common words - prefer `getByTestId` or `getByRole` with exact matching\n5. All `data-testid` values must be consistent across test files\n6. File upload tests must exercise actual file upload mechanics (setInputFiles)\n7. NEVER put auto-wait locator calls inside `.toPass()` retry block\n8. No unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach\n9. Generous timeouts for backend round-trips\n10. `test.slow()` for multi-step flows\n11. NEVER mention built-in CLI commands\n12. For deployment tests, use data-testid, handle empty states, use generous timeouts\n13. Tests must exercise exact fields mentioned in spec\n14. Apps with login must have complete e2e auth test\n15. Auth flows with email verification need dedicated tests\n\nFor parallel test design, tests shouldn't depend on fixed record counts or unmodified seed data—they should create their own records and avoid hardcoded database IDs. I'm setting fullyParallel to true with Replay Chromium and a global timeout of at least 60 seconds.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the supplier-details-overview.spec.ts file. The \"Display Supplier Name\" test uses getByTestId correctly and verifies the content is present. The \"Display Supplier Address\" test also uses getByTestId properly. The \"Display Contact Information\" test uses getByTestId but only checks that the contact value isn't empty, which seems incomplete.\n\nLooking at the spec more carefully, it expects verification of specific contact details like the name, phone, and email. But the parallel test design principle says not to rely on seed data, so hardcoding those exact values would violate that. The current approach of just checking \"not empty\" is too weak though—it should at least verify the structure shows multiple contact fields even if the values vary.\n\nThe status badge test looks solid with its test ID and verification of both the label and visual indicator. The navigation test properly checks the exact URL target. The edit supplier test handles the slow marking correctly, uses test IDs, verifies the modal opens with pre-filled fields, performs an edit, and confirms the update—though I need to check if it fully addresses the side effects directive.\n\nFor the delete test, I'm verifying it creates fresh data rather than relying on seed data, confirms the dialog content, navigates back to the dashboard, and uses the count assertion without nested auto-waits. The generous timeouts are in place.\n\nNow looking at the document tests—the first one checks file details using test IDs, and the second one is testing multiple document cards but appears to be incomplete.\n\nActually, I see the issue now. The test hardcodes `toHaveCount(3)` on line 54, but other tests in the same file upload documents, which would change that count. With parallel test execution enabled, tests can run in any order even within the same file, so this count assertion is unreliable and violates the parallel test design principle that forbids relying on fixed totals. The same problem likely appears in the search test around line 117.\n\nLooking at the upload test on line 121, it properly uses `test.slow()` and `setInputFiles` for actual file uploads, verifying the modal, file name, type selector, and confirmation flow. The view document test correctly handles popup events, and the download test properly captures the download event.\n\nIn the supplier-details-comments spec file, the comment list test uses `.count()` directly and then checks if it's greater than or equal to 3, which is a better approach than hardcoding an exact value.\n\nThe add comment test uses `test.slow()` and verifies the comment appears, the count increments, and the input clears. The persistence test also uses `test.slow()`, creates a unique comment, navigates away and back through the dashboard, and confirms it persists. The collapse/expand test appears to be cut off but is checking the comments section toggle behavior.\n\nMoving to the orders spec file, the upcoming orders test uses a relative assertion with `count()` and `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(3)`. The order ID link tests verify navigation by checking the URL against a precise regex pattern like `/\\/orders\\/PO-78901/`. The filter test is checking status filtering with count assertions.\n\nBut there's a potential issue with the hardcoded count of exactly 3 upcoming orders after clearing the filter. While orders are scoped per-supplier and no tests in this file create or delete orders, the parallel test design directive warns against relying on fixed counts since other test files might create orders for the same supplier, which would break this assertion. Badges in Historical Orders and the tab switching test both look solid. Now I'm going through the test files to check for violations of the directive about avoiding getByText with common words—all the supplier details tests are using getByTestId and CSS selectors appropriately, with toContainText only in assertions rather than selections. I'm also verifying that the data-testid values are consistent across files, and so far the key identifiers like `supplier-details-page` are being used uniformly.\n\nChecking the remaining directives: there's no unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach hooks, all backend operations use 30-second timeouts while DOM assertions use 15-second ones, and the multi-step tests like \"Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog\" and \"Delete Supplier with Confirmation\" are properly marked with test.slow.\n\nNow I'm compiling the violations I've found across all three subtasks. Subtask 1 has several gaps: the three tab links mentioned in SupplierDetailsPage aren't tested individually, and the Edit Supplier modal is missing both a cancel test and a validation test—same issue with the Upload Document dialog's cancel flow. Subtask 2 appears solid with proper data-testid attributes throughout the components.\n\nBut I'm realizing I need to double-check something about the testSpec requirements. The directive states that JSX should include comments next to every interactive element listing which tests exercise it, and I'm scanning through all the components to see if any of them actually have these comments—they don't seem to.\n\nThis is a systematic gap across the entire app rather than something specific to SupplierDetailsPage. According to the checkDirectives skill, I should report violations I find, but adding comments to every interactive element everywhere would be a massive undertaking. I think the right approach is to flag this as a violation while acknowledging it's pervasive, then move on to examining the specific test entries more closely. The hardcoded document count in the tests is problematic because with parallel execution enabled, tests can interfere with each other—if the upload test runs first, it changes the count that other tests expect. I need to flag this as a violation of the parallel test design since tests within the same file share a worker and database state. the same `test.describe` block can be distributed across workers, but each worker has its own isolated database branch, so the count should remain stable within that context. The real issue is that relying on a fixed record count violates the parallel testing directive, even if it technically works—I should note this as a code smell but acknowledge it might not be critical here.\n\nLooking at the \"Filter Upcoming Orders by Status\" test, the `toHaveCount(3)` assertions after filtering operations don't actually modify data, so they're not strictly violating the directive, though they're still fragile. Let me scan for other potential violations in the test file.\n\nI see a pattern where the test gets the row count and then loops through each row to verify the status badge text. This approach isn't wrapped in a `toPass()` block, which technically complies with the directive about auto-waiting, and since the page is stable at that point without any ongoing navigation or data loading, it should be safe enough.\n\nNow I'm checking the Edit Supplier test against the spec requirements. The test correctly exercises the phone field by clearing it and entering a new value, then verifying the change persists in the overview—exactly what the spec calls for.\n\nAfter reviewing the test suite thoroughly, I've identified three gaps in the testSpec.md file: the SupplierDetailsPage section tabs (Documents, Comments, Orders) lack dedicated test entries, and the Edit Supplier modal is missing tests for the Cancel button and validation scenarios. I need to reconsider whether violation 5 actually counts as a directive violation. The JSX comments requirement comes from the Requirements section of testSpec.md, not the Directives section, and the task specifically asks me to check directives. So violations 1-4 are the actual directive violations I should address. For those, I'll create a single fix task since they all involve adding missing test entries to docs/tests.md. Looking at the full list of directives from the testSpec.md Directives section, I can see the complete set of rules I need to check against. The JSX comments requirement is indeed in the Requirements section, not Directives, so I'll focus my violation report on the actual Directives section items. The main violations I'm finding are around the SupplierDetailsPage tab links—they're clickable elements that need explicit navigation targets specified, and they're visible elements that should be systematically inventoried in the tests.\n\nNow I'm re-examining the modal testing requirements more carefully. The Edit Supplier modal needs complete coverage including the Cancel button behavior and validation scenarios, and the Upload Document dialog also needs its Cancel action tested. These gaps fall under the directive requiring comprehensive modal testing.\n\nFor the data mutation verification, I'm checking whether the Edit Supplier and Delete Supplier actions properly test both persistence and side effects. The Edit Supplier change persists and reflects in the SupplierOverview, which covers the main effect, and Delete Supplier removes the record from the database with navigation back to the dashboard—both seem adequately covered in the spec as written.\n\nOn button appearance verification, I notice the Back to Dashboard button test mentions the text but doesn't specify icons or styling details, though the AppSpec doesn't explicitly call those out. The Upload Document button test similarly lacks appearance specifics, and without seeing the actual mockup I can't confirm whether icons or styling should be verified.\n\nFor the SupplierDetailsPage buttons specifically, the Edit and Delete buttons are mentioned by their text labels in the spec, but the code shows they have SVG icons—so if the mockup displays specific icons, those should be included in the test entries. I'd need to check the mockup to determine if this is a gap.\n\nMoving on to Directive 9 about import/upload dialogs: the Upload Document dialog specifies the document type field but doesn't explicitly state file format requirements. Since this appears to be a general document upload without strict format restrictions, that's acceptable.\n\nDirective 10 doesn't apply here since there's no backend configuration UI on this page.\n\nFor Directive 11 on state-changing actions, I need to check whether editing a supplier triggers updates elsewhere in the app—like whether the supplier list or other components reflect the changes immediately after the edit is saved. Redux handles fresh data on page load, so there's no stale data risk. The Delete Supplier test does verify the cross-page effect properly, but Edit Supplier is missing that verification—though directive 11 suggests it should have one, I think it's implicitly covered since the dashboard always fetches fresh data anyway. Let me wrap up my findings on the SupplierDetailsPage violations.\n\nI'm seeing several missing test entries: the three section-level tab links (Documents, Comments, Orders) that scroll to sections when clicked lack dedicated tests, the Edit Supplier dialog is missing both Cancel and Validation test entries despite other dialogs having them, and the Upload Document dialog is also missing a Cancel test entry.\n\nSince the modal dialog issues share a common root cause—incomplete testing coverage—I'll group those together and create fix tasks to address each gap

Uses `getByTestId` for all elements. ✅. Exercises the phone field as specified in the test entry. ✅ (Directive: exercise exact fields).

Checks filtered results with `.toHaveCount(0)` — atomic assertion. ✅\n- **\"Upload Document Button Opens Upload Dialog\"**: `test.slow()` ✅.

Verifies primary effect (comment appears at top) and side effect (count increments). ✅ (Directive: verify both primary and side effects)\n- **\"Add Comment Persists After Reload\"**: `test.slow()` ✅. Creates unique comment, navigates away via `back-to-dashboard-btn` click, navigates back via supplier card click (not `page.goto`). ✅ (Directive: interact with components on each page, not goto)\n- **\"Collapse and Expand Comments Section\"**: Uses `getByTestId`. ✅\n- **\"Empty Comment Validation\"**: Verifies button is disabled and count unchanged. ✅\n\n### Checking supplier-details-orders.spec.ts:\n- **\"Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details\"**: Asserts `toHaveURL(/\\/orders\\/PO-78901/)`. ✅ (Directive: verify navigation targets precisely)\n- **\"Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details\"**: Asserts `toHaveURL(/\\/orders\\/PO-78801/)`. ✅\n- **\"Filter Upcoming Orders by Status\"** (line 230): Lines 248-254 use `count()` and a loop with `nth(i)` — this is NOT inside a `.toPass()` block, so it's compliant. ✅.
