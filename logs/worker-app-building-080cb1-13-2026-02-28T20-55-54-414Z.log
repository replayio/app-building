Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task.

All browsers must run headless. If a browser complains about\n   102→  a missing display, the fix is to ensure it runs headless, not to add a virtual display.\n   103→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me create a comprehensive report.\n\n## Comprehensive Report: Existing Scripts and Patterns\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the repository, here's what I found:\n\n### 1. **TypeScript Scripts in `scripts/` Directory**\n\n**Root Scripts:**\n- `/repo/scripts/add-task.ts` - Task queue management utility\n\n**LoopBuilder App Scripts (in `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/scripts/`):**\n- `schema.ts` - Database schema initialization\n- `migrate.ts` - Database migrations\n- `test.ts` - Full test orchestration with Neon branching and Replay recording\n- `check.ts` - Typecheck and linting\n- `seed-db.ts` - Test data seeding\n\n### 2. **Schema Initialization (`schema.ts`)**\n\nThe `initSchema()` function creates the following tables:\n- **apps** - Main application records with status, progress, deployment_url\n- **app_requests** - User requests with acceptance/rejection tracking\n- **activity_log** - Timestamped logs per app with expandable fields\n- Creates indexes for efficient querying by status, app_id, and timestamp\n\n```typescript\nexport async function initSchema(databaseUrl: string): Promise<void> {\n  const sql = neon(databaseUrl)\n  // Creates: apps, app_requests, activity_log tables with indexes\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Migration Logic (`migrate.ts`)**\n\nThe `runMigrations()` function:\n- Creates `schema_migrations` tracking table\n- Tracks which migrations have been applied\n- Provides a migration pattern for future ALTER TABLE operations\n- Takes database URL as parameter\n\n```typescript\nexport async function runMigrations(databaseUrl: string): Promise<void> {\n  const sql = neon(databaseUrl)\n  // Tracks applied migrations\n}\n```\n\n### 4. **Complete Existing Script Pattern (`test.ts`)**\n\nThe test script demonstrates the full pattern:\n- **Environment Loading**: Reads `.env` file manually to populate `process.env`\n- **Validation**: Checks for required env vars (NEON_API_KEY, NEON_PROJECT_ID, DATABASE_URL)\n- **Neon API Usage**:\n  - Constructs headers with bearer token\n  - Creates ephemeral branches for testing\n  - Manages branch lifecycle (create → use → delete)\n- **Database Setup**: Calls initSchema, runMigrations, seedTestData in sequence\n- **Process Management**: Uses `execSync`/`spawnSync` to run subprocesses with logging\n- **Logging**: Writes to `logs/` directory with incrementing numbers\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with cleanup in finally block\n- **Exit Codes**: Returns non-zero on failure\n\n### 5. **Check Script Pattern (`check.ts`)**\n\nDemonstrates quality gate patterns:\n- **TypeCheck**: `npx tsc --noEmit`\n- **Linting**: `npx eslint . --fix`\n- **Logging**: Creates `logs/check.log` with full output\n- **Exit Logic**: Exits with code 1 on failure, 0 on success\n- **Output**: Single-line summary to stdout\n\n### 6. **Package Configuration**\n\n**Root `package.json`:**\n- Scripts: agent, status, read-log, reset-app, docker:build, test-container, stop, fly-machines, add-task\n\n**LoopBuilder `package.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"vite\",\n    \"build\": \"tsc -b && vite build\",\n    \"lint\": \"eslint .\",\n    \"preview\": \"vite preview\",\n    \"check\": \"tsx scripts/check.ts\",\n    \"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 7. **Build Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)**\n\n```typescript\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react()],\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,  // For Replay recordings\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### 8. **Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)**\n\n```toml\n[build]\n  base = \"apps/LoopBuilder\"\n  command = \"npm run build\"\n  publish = \"dist\"\n  functions = \"netlify/functions\"\n\n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/*\"\n  to = \"/index.html\"\n  status = 200\n```\n\n### 9. **Netlify Functions Structure**\n\nThree serverless functions in `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/netlify/functions/`:\n- **apps.ts** - GET all apps or GET specific app by ID\n- **activity.ts** - GET activity log for an app\n- **request.ts** - POST new app request with validation and assessment\n\nAll use `neon()` from `@neondatabase/serverless` to access DATABASE_URL.\n\n### 10. **Environment Variables Setup**\n\n**Root `.env.example`:**\n```\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\nGITHUB_TOKEN=\nNETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG=\nNETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=\nNEON_API_KEY=\nUPLOADTHING_TOKEN=\nRESEND_API_KEY=\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY=\nFLY_API_TOKEN= # optional\n```\n\n### 11. **Deployment Documentation & Skills**\n\n**Key Skill Files:**\n- `/repo/skills/scripts/deploy.md` - Deploy script specification (the reference you mentioned)\n- `/repo/skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md` - Post-deploy verification steps\n- `/repo/skills/tasks/deployment.md` - Full deployment workflow\n- `/repo/skills/scripts/netlify-env.md` - Netlify API env var management\n\n**Deploy Script Specification Summary:**\n- Creates Neon project (first run only) via REST API\n- Syncs database schema (every run)\n- Creates/updates Netlify site via `netlify sites:create` CLI\n- Builds app with `vite build`\n- Deploys to Netlify with `netlify deploy --prod`\n- Manages `.env` for resource IDs (NEON_PROJECT_ID, NETLIFY_SITE_ID, DATABASE_URL)\n- Writes deployment info to `deployment.txt` (committed to git)\n\n### 12. **Key Patterns for Deploy Script Implementation**\n\n1. **Neon API Pattern** (from test.ts):\n   ```typescript\n   const neonHeaders = { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${NEON_API_KEY}` }\n   async function neonApi(path: string, options: RequestInit = {}): Promise<Response> {\n     return fetch(`https://console.neon.tech/api/v2${path}`, {\n       ...options,\n       headers: { ...neonHeaders, ...options.headers },\n     })\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Netlify CLI Usage**:\n   - Site creation: `netlify sites:create --account-slug $NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG`\n   - Deployment: `netlify deploy --prod --dir dist --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n3. **Netlify API Pattern** (for env vars):\n   ```bash\n   curl -s -X POST \"https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/accounts/${NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG}/env?site_id=${NETLIFY_SITE_ID}\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer $NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '[{\"key\":\"DATABASE_URL\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"'\"$DATABASE_URL\"'\",\"context\":\"all\"}]}]'\n   ```\n\n4. **Logging Pattern**:\n   - Create `logs/` directory if needed\n   - Append all subprocess output to a log file\n   - Print one-line summary to stdout\n   - Exit with code 0 on success, non-zero on failure\n\n5. **File I/O Pattern** (reading/writing `.env`):\n   - Parse as key=value lines\n   - Don't clobber existing values\n   - Append new entries\n\n### 13. **Deployment History Format**\n\nApps that have been deployed have `deployment.txt` with:\n- Resource block at top: `url`, `site_id`, `deployed_at`, `neon_project_id`, `database_url`\n- History entries below: `--- Deployment YYYY-MM-DD ---` with change summary\n\n---\n\nThis is the complete reference for implementing the deploy script. The pattern is consistent across all existing scripts: environment loading, validation, API calls with proper error handling, logging to `logs/` directory, and clear exit codes."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: aecb284852977ea6e (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 43161\ntool_uses: 37\nduration_ms: 47503</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"496d909c-d711-4bfc-ba3c-10194d61b39a","uuid":"eecec808-5da1-4fbe-9fbc-ae51d4f8e001","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the existing scripts and patterns in this repo to implement a deploy script.

GET all apps or GET specific app by ID\n- **activity.ts** - GET activity log for an app\n- **request.ts** - POST new app request with validation and assessment\n\nAll use `neon()` from `@neondatabase/serverless` to access DATABASE_URL.\n\n### 10. **Environment Variables Setup**\n\n**Root `.env.example`:**\n```\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\nGITHUB_TOKEN=\nNETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG=\nNETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=\nNEON_API_KEY=\nUPLOADTHING_TOKEN=\nRESEND_API_KEY=\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY=\nFLY_API_TOKEN= # optional\n```\n\n### 11. **Deployment Documentation & Skills**\n\n**Key Skill Files:**\n- `/repo/skills/scripts/deploy.md` - Deploy script specification (the reference you mentioned)\n- `/repo/skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md` - Post-deploy verification steps\n- `/repo/skills/tasks/deployment.md` - Full deployment workflow\n- `/repo/skills/scripts/netlify-env.md` - Netlify API env var management\n\n**Deploy Script Specification Summary:**\n- Creates Neon project (first run only) via REST API\n- Syncs database schema (every run)\n- Creates/updates Netlify site via `netlify sites:create` CLI\n- Builds app with `vite build`\n- Deploys to Netlify with `netlify deploy --prod`\n- Manages `.env` for resource IDs (NEON_PROJECT_ID, NETLIFY_SITE_ID, DATABASE_URL)\n- Writes deployment info to `deployment.txt` (committed to git)\n\n### 12. **Key Patterns for Deploy Script Implementation**\n\n1. **Neon API Pattern** (from test.ts):\n   ```typescript\n   const neonHeaders = { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${NEON_API_KEY}` }\n   async function neonApi(path: string, options: RequestInit = {}): Promise<Response> {\n     return fetch(`https://console.neon.tech/api/v2${path}`, {\n       ...options,\n       headers: { ...neonHeaders, ...options.headers },\n     })\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Netlify CLI Usage**:\n   - Site creation: `netlify sites:create --account-slug $NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG`\n   - Deployment: `netlify deploy --prod --dir dist --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n3. **Netlify API Pattern** (for env vars):\n   ```bash\n   curl -s -X POST \"https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/accounts/${NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG}/env?site_id=${NETLIFY_SITE_ID}\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer $NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '[{\"key\":\"DATABASE_URL\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"'\"$DATABASE_URL\"'\",\"context\":\"all\"}]}]'\n   ```\n\n4. **Logging Pattern**:\n   - Create `logs/` directory if needed\n   - Append all subprocess output to a log file\n   - Print one-line summary to stdout\n   - Exit with code 0 on success, non-zero on failure\n\n5. **File I/O Pattern** (reading/writing `.env`):\n   - Parse as key=value lines\n   - Don't clobber existing values\n   - Append new entries\n\n### 13. **Deployment History Format**\n\nApps that have been deployed have `deployment.txt` with:\n- Resource block at top: `url`, `site_id`, `deployed_at`, `neon_project_id`, `database_url`\n- History entries below: `--- Deployment YYYY-MM-DD ---` with change summary\n\n---\n\nThis is the complete reference for implementing the deploy script. The pattern is consistent across all existing scripts: environment loading, validation, API calls with proper error handling, logging to `logs/` directory, and clear exit codes."}],"totalDurationMs":47503,"totalTokens":43161,"totalToolUseCount":37,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":233,"cache_read_input_tokens":40824,"output_tokens":2104,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":233},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}
