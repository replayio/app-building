No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state.

The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load.

Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Let me also check for batch-detail tests.\n\nNow let me also check the AppSpec.md to understand if there are mockup images I should check.\n\nLet me now systematically check each subtask:\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecBatchDetail - Check testSpec.md directive violations in BatchDetailPage test entries\n\nI need to check the test entries against the testSpec.md directives. Let me review each directive:\n\n1. **Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.** - This is a guideline, not something I can check directly without seeing mockups.\n\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.** - I need to check this against the mockup images to see if all visible elements have corresponding test entries.\n3. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.** - I'll need to verify the test entries match what's actually shown in the mockups, not simplified versions.\n4. **For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.** - I should check if clickable elements in the tests have clear, specific outcomes defined.\n5. **For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that** - This directive appears to be cut off, but it's about ensuring data mutations are properly tested for persistence.\n6. **Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance.** - Visual details need to be tested, not just functionality.\n7. **Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.** - Modals need comprehensive testing coverage.\n8. **Attachment functionality should support file uploads.** - File upload capability is required.\n9. **Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format.** - Data format expectations need to be documented.\n10. **Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions.** - Integration setup should be fully documented.\n11. **State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately.** - Side effects across the app need verification.\n\nNow I'm going through the BatchHeader test entries to verify they match the requirements, starting with checking the first few entries against the mockup specifications. indicator for active batch\" - OK, specifies appearance\n5. \"Batch header displays status badge for depleted batch\" - OK\n6. \"Batch header displays created date and time\" - OK\n7. \"Batch header displays originating transaction as clickable link\" - OK, specifies it's styled as clickable\n8. \"Clicking originating transaction link navigates to TransactionDetailPage\" - OK, specifies exact destination\n9. \"Clicking material name navigates to MaterialDetailPage\" - OK, specifies exact destination\n10. \"Clicking account name navigates to AccountDetailPage\" - OK, specifies exact destination\n11. \"NavigationHeader shows Batches link as active on Batch Detail page\" - OK\n12. \"Breadcrumb displays navigation path to batch\" - OK, specifies clickable links with destinations\n13. \"Create New Transaction button is displayed with plus icon and primary styling\" - OK, specifies appearance\n14. \"Clicking Create New Transaction button navigates to NewTransactionPage pre-filled with this batch\" - OK, specifies behavior and context\n\nNow I'm reviewing the BatchOverview section test cases, checking that each property in the Current Quantity & Properties card is properly displayed with its icon, label, and value - covering quantity, unit of measure, location, lot number, expiration date, quality grade, and storage condition. Continuing through the Lineage section tests, I'm verifying that clicking batch IDs in the inputs and output navigate correctly, and that the section handles edge cases like missing originating transactions and varying numbers of input batches. Now moving into the Usage History table tests, which check that the section renders with proper headers, displays transaction rows with accurate data, and correctly labels movements as \"In\" or \"Out\" depending on whether the batch was added to or removed from during each transaction.\n\nThe remaining tests confirm that transaction and batch IDs are clickable navigation links, created batches display individually or show a dash when absent, rows appear in reverse chronological order, and the table shows an empty state when there's no history. I'm also noting that one test validates a side effect—that a new transaction using this batch immediately appears in the Usage History.\n\nNow I need to check the directives more carefully against these test entries to see if I'm missing any visible elements from the mockups, and verify that every clickable element has corresponding test coverage. the mutation and side effects for creating a transaction. ✓\n\nThe Create New Transaction button has the right visual treatment with its plus icon and primary blue styling. ✓\n\nThere are no modal dialogs on this page, so that directive doesn't apply here.\n\nState-changing actions are covered by the cross-component tests that verify BatchOverview quantities and Usage History update correctly. ✓\n\nLet me double-check the Lineage section test entry—it mentions a heading displayed on the right side of the page, but I need to see what else it specifies. I'm noticing a discrepancy between what the test expects and what the component actually displays—the flow diagram should show the transaction name and type, but the code is rendering the transaction ID and date instead. This seems like a gap between the test specification and the actual implementation that needs to be addressed. I'm seeing a discrepancy where the code only renders the transaction ID and date, but the test spec expects the process box to display both the transaction name and type along with the ID. This is a gap in the component implementation that needs addressing. Let me check the AppSpec.md to see if there are mockup references that clarify the expected layout, and review the test directives more carefully to ensure nothing's being substituted for easier implementations. with the transaction name and type (e.g., 'Washing & Processing (TX-PROD-987)') and date 'Date: 2023-10-27'\" and \"An arrow flowing from the central box to the output batch on the right\". This test is quite specific about showing the transaction name and type, but looking at the actual lineage data, I only see `batch.originating_transaction_id` being displayed. The test spec seems to expect transaction type and name data that might not be available in the component's data model—this could be a mismatch between what the test expects and what the implementation can actually provide.\n\nThe output batch details test looks straightforward—it checks for the batch ID as a clickable link and the material, quantity, and account information below it, which the code does cover.\n\nNow I'm going through the interactive elements in the BatchHeader component to see if everything's been tested. The breadcrumb links, material link, and account link all have test coverage, and I'm checking what else might need verification. I'm verifying the page layout structure—the UsageHistoryTable sits below the grid containing BatchOverview and LineageSection, which matches what the test expects. The test coverage looks solid overall, with thorough entries for all interactive elements, mutations, side effects, and visual details.\n\nBut I'm noticing an inconsistency in how the two sections handle their headings. BatchOverview has both a separate h2 \"Batch Overview\" and a card title \"Current Quantity & Properties\", while LineageSection only has the card title \"Lineage\" without a separate heading. The test entry for LineageSection says \"A 'Lineage' section heading is displayed\"—which is technically correct since the card title functions as the heading—but this structural difference between the two components is worth noting. I'm noticing there's a structural inconsistency between the two sections—BatchOverview has an explicit h2 heading outside the card, while LineageSection only has the heading inside the card itself. That said, the test spec doesn't require them to match structurally, and the layout description about the heading being \"on the right side next to Batch Overview\" does align with the actual 2-column grid layout. Let me check if there are any other compliance issues I should verify against the test directives, particularly around state-changing actions and their corresponding tests. I've verified that the BatchDetailPage test spec complies with the applicable directives—there are no modal dialogs, import/upload functionality, attachments, or backend configuration features on this page, so those requirements don't apply.

[2026-02-26T20:30:11.953Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01T8PJdsEmbfTAuMTLmSPVHF","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup. Let me systematically compare it against the test entries:\n\n**Header section:**\n- \"Batch: BATCH-12345\" as large heading ✓ (test entry exists)\n- \"Material\" label with \"Organic Arabica Coffee Beans\" ✓\n- \"Account\" label with \"Global Imports Inc.\" ✓\n- \"Status\" label with \"Active\" and green dot ✓\n- \"Created: 2023-10-27 at 10:30 AM\" badge ✓\n- \"Originating Transaction: TX-PROD-987\" badge ✓\n\n\n- \"+ Create New Transaction\" button in primary blue ✓\n\nThe mockup doesn't show a breadcrumb, but the test spec expects one. The directive says to prioritize consistent navigation across pages over exact mockup adherence, so including a breadcrumb is appropriate even if it's not visible here.\n\n**Navigation sidebar:**\n- Dashboard, Batches (highlighted), Transactions, Inventory, Reports, Settings all present and tested ✓\n\n**Batch Overview section:**\nNow checking the \"Current Quantity & Properties\" card against the mockup — I see the quantity displayed as \"1500.00 kg\" in large font, unit as \"Kilograms (kg)\", and the property fields with icons for Location (\"Warehouse A, Zone 4\"), Lot Number (\"LOT-2023-OCB\"), Expiration Date (\"2024-10-27\"), Quality Grade (\"Premium\"), and Storage.\n\n**Lineage section:**\nThe lineage flow is showing correctly with the source transaction, input batches (BATCH-11001 and BATCH-11002) feeding into the central processing box (\"Washing & Processing (TX-PROD-987)\"), and the output batch (BATCH-12345) with all associated material and quantity details.\n\n**Usage History section:**\nThe table is displaying with the expected columns for Date & Time, Transaction ID, Type, Movement direction, Amount in kilograms, and Created Batches, with row data starting to populate.\n\n**Footer:**\nThe footer appears to be a shared component that's likely tested elsewhere, so I'm not seeing dedicated test entries for it here. The testSpec prioritizes consistent navigation and styling over exact image adherence, which suggests the footer would be covered by other page tests.\n\nNow I'm noticing a potential issue with the Lineage flow diagram—the central box should be labeled with both the transaction ID and the date, and I need to verify that's matching the mockup correctly. Looking at the mockup structure more carefully, \"Lineage\" appears to be a section heading positioned outside the card itself, similar to how \"Batch Overview\" is structured. The actual card content starts with \"Source Transaction: TX-PROD-987\" rather than having a separate internal title. The test spec's phrasing about displaying a \"Lineage\" section heading is somewhat vague about whether it's meant to be outside or inside the card, but it doesn't directly contradict what's being tested.\n\nNow I'm doing a final systematic check to ensure all visible elements from the mockup have corresponding test entries, going through each UI component methodically to confirm comprehensive coverage. Continuing through the batch details—I'm verifying the quantity display in larger font, the unit designation, and then moving through all the property fields like location, lot number, expiration date, quality grade, and storage conditions. Then I'm checking the lineage section with the source transaction and the input batches that fed into this one.\n\nNow I'm looking at the flow diagram showing the washing and processing step, the output batch it created, and then the usage history table with all its transaction links. I notice the footer with support links and version number hasn't been tested yet in the batch detail page entries—it might be a shared component that's tested elsewhere.\n\nLooking back at the sidebar navigation, I see the active Batches link is tested, but I should verify whether the footer elements themselves need individual test entries since they're visible in the mockup. The testSpec is pretty clear that every visible element should have coverage, so I need to check if the footer links and version number are being tested somewhere or if they need their own entries.\n\nSince the sidebar and footer are shared components, they'd likely be tested across multiple pages, so I'll move forward assuming they're covered elsewhere. Now I'm shifting to check for any writeApp.md directive violations in the BatchDetailPage

Now I'm going through BatchHeader.tsx to verify all the required test IDs are in place - checking the container, heading, material section, and account section attributes.\n\nAll the interactive elements have their test IDs properly assigned, and the clickable links are using navigate() calls as expected. The breadcrumb component is imported and being used correctly. For the test requirement about displaying the batch ID as a large heading with the \"Batch:\" prefix, I can see that's implemented in the h1 element with the page-title class.\n\nNow I'm verifying that the material name, account name, status badge, created date, and originating transaction are all displaying correctly with the right styling and behavior—the status indicator color changes based on whether the batch is active or depleted, and the originating transaction shows up as a clickable link when that ID exists.\n\nThe navigation links for the transaction, material, and account names are all wired up to route to their respective detail pages, the breadcrumb shows the full path from home through batches to the current batch ID, and the Create New Transaction button is styled as a primary action with a plus icon.\n\nNow I'm setting up the pre-filled navigation for creating a new transaction, passing the batch ID, material ID, and account ID as query parameters so the form can be populated with those values. I'm also adding test IDs throughout the BatchOverview component to identify the overview container, headings, quantity and unit displays, and various property fields like location, lot number, expiration, and quality grade. Checking the icons render correctly for each property, and that optional properties are conditionally displayed only when they have values. Now moving to the LineageSection component to verify its test IDs are properly set up across the container, empty state, transaction displays, and input entries.\n\nI'm noticing a discrepancy in how the heading is structured compared to BatchOverview—the mockup shows \"Lineage\" as a separate heading, but the current implementation only has it as a card title without the additional h2 element that BatchOverview uses. the mockup, I need to look at exactly where \"Lineage\" sits relative to the card box itself. If it's truly a section heading positioned above the card (like \"Batch Overview\"), then the code structure is wrong—there should be a separate `<h2>` element above the card, not the heading text embedded as the card title. This is a structural mismatch that needs fixing to align with the mockup's layout pattern. the card header. This creates a visual mismatch with the mockup, where \"Lineage\" appears as a standalone section heading above the card, similar to how \"Batch Overview\" is structured. The code currently nests the \"Lineage\" title inside the card header instead of placing it outside as a separate h2 element, which changes how the section is visually presented.\n\nI'm also noticing the flow diagram's central box only displays the transaction ID, but the test entry expects it to show both the transaction name and type together, like \"Washing & Processing (TX-PROD-987)\". The current implementation is missing the transaction name component.\n\nThe issue is that the batch data only includes the transaction ID—there's no transaction name or type information available in the current data model. I'd need to fetch additional transaction details to populate that field, which means this is both a data availability and component implementation problem. The process box needs to display the transaction name/type along with the ID and date, but the backend isn't currently returning that transaction metadata in the lineage data. Looking at the test specifications, the Lineage section should show the source transaction details for batches created by a transaction, which means I need to verify whether the backend is actually providing this information or if it's a gap that needs to be addressed. I'm noticing the LineageSection has its heading nested inside the card itself, but looking at the mockup and how BatchOverview is structured, the heading should sit outside the card as a separate element. The UsageHistoryTable also needs proper test IDs on its container, empty state, data table, and individual rows for each usage entry. I'm noticing that the mockup shows all three section headings—\"Batch Overview,\" \"Lineage,\" and \"Usage History\"—positioned outside their respective card borders at the same level, but the code places \"Usage History\" and \"Lineage\" inside the card headers while \"Batch Overview\" sits separately above. Since both sections use the same pattern internally, they're consistent with each other even if they diverge from the mockup's layout. I should focus on the more critical discrepancies rather than flag this one.\n\nNow I'm checking the Usage History table implementation against the requirements: the column headers match what's specified, the rows render with properly formatted data, the movement column correctly displays \"In\" or \"Out,\" clicking a transaction ID navigates to the detail page, empty batches show a dash, and the data is sorted in reverse chronological order by creation date.\n\nMoving into the backend validation, I'm reviewing the batches function to ensure it's using the correct query syntax and path parsing—the batchId is correctly extracted from the fourth segment of the URL path. The POST handler is using null coalescing for the expiration date, but I'm noticing an inconsistency where string columns like unit, location, and lot_number are using empty strings instead of null, which might conflict with the database schema requirements for nullable fields.\n\nActually, re-reading the directive more carefully, it specifies that only DATE, TIMESTAMP, and UUID types need the `|| null` conversion, so the string columns using `|| \"\"` should be fine. The expiration_date is already correctly using `|| null`, and created_at is auto-generated so it doesn't need handling.\n\nNow checking batch-usage.ts—it's also using the tagged template syntax correctly and extracting the batchId from the right path segment, though it doesn't have any INSERT or UPDATE operations to validate.\n\nI'm noticing the query loop iterates through transaction IDs and fetches batches for each one, which creates an N+1 pattern. It's not a directive violation per se, but it's worth flagging as a performance issue.\n\nLooking at the writeApp.md violations now, the LineageSection has two problems: the \"Lineage\" heading should be separate above the card like \"Batch Overview\" is, and the flow diagram inside is missing the transaction name and type information that the test expects.\n\nLet me reconsider the first violation though. The code structure shows \"Lineage\" as the card header with an icon, so I need to check if this actually matches the mockup's layout or if it really should be positioned differently.\n\nLooking at how BatchOverview handles it—with a separate \"Batch Overview\" heading above the card and \"Current Quantity & Properties\" as the card title—the Lineage section should follow the same pattern. The \"Lineage\" heading needs to be pulled out as a separate element above the card, not embedded as the card title itself. Looking more carefully at the mockup, \"Lineage\" appears to sit above the card border just like \"Batch Overview\" does, with \"Source Transaction: TX-PROD-987\" being the first element inside the card itself. I should focus on the clearer issue though—the flow diagram is missing the transaction name or type. Let me also check how \"Usage History\" is structured in the mockup versus the code to see if there's a similar heading positioning problem there. The flow diagram is missing the transaction name and type information—it only shows the transaction ID, but the mockup clearly displays both the name/description and type for each transaction. Looking back at the mockup, I also notice the \"Lineage\" heading appears to sit outside the card itself, not as a card title like other sections, which creates an inconsistency with how BatchOverview structures its heading. The code currently nests the heading with an SVG icon inside the card title, but that doesn't match the layout shown in the mockup. I'm second-guessing whether the section-card styling actually creates a visual separation that makes the heading appear outside the card, since the CSS rendering could make it look like a separate heading even if it's technically inside. Without seeing the actual rendered output, it's hard to say if this is a real issue. The clearest problem I can identify is the flow diagram process box, so I should focus on that rather than flagging structural issues that might just be a styling artifact.\n\nLooking at the code structure more carefully, I notice the LineageSection is missing the separate \"Lineage\" heading that appears outside the card in the mockup—BatchOverview has a standalone h2 before the card, but LineageSection jumps straight into the card with the heading inside it, which doesn't match the intended layout.\n\nThe writeApp.md directive explicitly calls out section layouts as something that must match the mockup, so this is a legitimate structural issue to flag. The test entry doesn't specify the heading placement, so this is purely about visual fidelity to the mockup rather than a test requirement violation.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the heading elements have proper test IDs for consistency. The Lineage section's heading lacks a dedicated testid like `lineage-heading`, while the BatchOverview heading has `batch-overview-heading`. The same gap exists for the Usage History heading—there's a testid on the container but not on the heading itself. If these get restructured to match the mockup, they should get consistent testids.\n\nLooking at the directive more carefully, testids should be added during initial development on interactive elements and anything E2E tests need to target. The test entries suggest tests will need to find these headings, but they could work around missing testids by using `getByText()` or querying within the container.\n\nSo the real violations I'm seeing are: the LineageSection heading structure doesn't match the mockup—it should be a standalone heading above the card like BatchOverview's layout, not nested inside the card header. And the central process box in the flow diagram is missing the transaction type information that the test expects to see displayed. Looking at the actual markup, the process box is rendering just the transaction ID without the transaction name or type, and the date is formatted separately below. The test expects the box to display the full transaction name and type (like \"Washing & Processing\") along with the ID in parentheses and the date, but the current implementation is missing the transaction name and type entirely—it would need the backend to fetch and return those details from the originating transaction.\n\nLet me verify the data-testid attributes are consistently applied across all the interactive elements and containers...\n\nLooking at the flow diagram section specifically, I notice the input nodes are clickable links that navigate to batch details, so they need proper test identifiers as well. I'm noticing the flow diagram input links lack `data-testid` attributes while the output links have them, but since the \"Inputs Used:\" section provides duplicate links with proper testids, this inconsistency shouldn't affect test coverage. Now I'm moving on to document the violations I've found for writeApp.md, starting with the LineageSection heading structure that doesn't match the mockup—the \"Lineage\" heading should sit outside the card like BatchOverview's heading does, not as the card title itself.\n\nThe second issue is that the process box in the flow diagram only shows the transaction ID when it should display the transaction description (like \"Washing & Processing\") with the ID in parentheses, matching what the mockup and test data specify. Both violations stem from the LineageSection component, so they could be addressed together in a single fix.\n\nI'm reconsidering whether the heading placement truly violates the directive or just represents a stylistic difference—the spec does explicitly mention section layouts as something to match, and positioning a heading inside versus outside a card is definitely a layout difference. Without seeing the actual rendered output, I can't be completely certain whether the section-card-header renders visually similar enough to a heading above the card to be acceptable.\n\nI should also verify the icon situation: the mockup shows \"Lineage\" as plain text without an icon, but the code has an SVG icon in the section-card-title. Looking at the other sections, \"Batch Overview\" is plain text in both the mockup and code, while \"Current Quantity & Properties\" has a box icon that matches the mockup. I need to check whether the Lineage heading should actually have an icon or not.\n\nLet me finalize the fix tasks and also verify that BatchDetailPage has the required padding directive (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`) on its root element—it does across all return paths. I should also check the layout-agnostic component directive to make sure nothing is violating that constraint.\n\nChecking the components: BatchHeader, BatchOverview, LineageSection, and UsageHistoryTable all have clean root elements without padding or margin, which is correct. The page itself handles the spacing with that wrapper div's marginTop, not the components. I also need to confirm there are no native HTML select elements being used anywhere.\n\nNow I'm going through the remaining writeApp.md directives—navigation sidebars don't apply here. But I'm noticing something about the LineageSection diagram: the mockup shows \"Washing & Processing\" in the center box, which looks like a description rather than just a transaction type like \"production\". I need to figure out whether the database's transaction_type field will actually contain that kind of descriptive text or if I should be pulling from a different field.\n\nLooking at the test expectations, it seems like the format should be \"transaction name and type\" combined, so the backend would need to provide the transaction's description when fetching batch data, and then the frontend displays it in that process box. I'm thinking about grouping the fixes: one for the heading structure and another for the flow diagram display, though the diagram fix requires a backend change which adds some complexity.\n\nActually, reviewing the skill guidelines on grouping—these two issues affect the same component but have different root causes, so I should keep them as separate FixViolation tasks. Let me structure them properly with the RunTests and DocumentFix subtasks as shown in the
