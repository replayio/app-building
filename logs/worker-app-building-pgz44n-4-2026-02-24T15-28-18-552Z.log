Let me understand the structure better. The merge was between:\n- `09084a2` (the local branch `sales-crm-2` - app building work on SalesCRM)\n- `321dec5` (from `origin/main` - infrastructure changes: renaming strategies to skills, etc.)\n\nThe `--theirs` resolution means the remote/main version was accepted for conflicts. So the local branch's changes to conflicting files may have been lost.\n\nLet me look at what files had conflicts during the merge.

Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips).

NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":144,"startLine":1,"totalLines":144}}}

Let me look more carefully at the merge itself. The fact that `--theirs` was used means the remote (main) changes were preferred.

This means the merge properly handled the rename + content changes, OR the \"resolve conflicts\" commits actually re-applied changes.\n\nWait, actually I need to check the merge more carefully. The `--theirs` flag on `git merge` means \"accept the other branch's version in case of conflict.\" But if git detected the rename from `strategies/` to `skills/`, it might have applied the local changes to the renamed files automatically. Or the resolve conflicts commits might have fixed things (but they only added log files).\n\n\nI need to verify whether the skill files in `skills/` contain all the content that was originally added to `strategies/` on the local branch. The merge brought in the renamed directory structure from main, but I'm not certain if the local additions to those files were preserved or lost when `--theirs` was applied.\n\nLooking at the specific additions: the CSS guidance about `overflow: hidden` and absolutely-positioned elements is definitely there in the current writeApp.md file. For writeTests.md, I can see the local addition about test spec entries is also present, so it appears both sets of changes made it through the merge despite my initial concern.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":711,"cache_read_input_tokens":45676,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":711,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2cecbe90-f526-401d-b277-8623066dca14","uuid":"692db765-794b-4bdb-a840-abe10aa1d360"}
