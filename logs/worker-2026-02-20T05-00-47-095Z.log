You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\nWhenever possible you must act according to the strategy documents. Usually you will know what strategy\nyou must be following. If you are responding to a user message and don't know what strategy to use,\nlook for a suitable one in `strategies/messages/`. If there isn't one do your best to satisfy the\nuser's request, and then write a new strategy document there to help yourself in the future when\nsimilar requests are made.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nEach worker invocation handles exactly one job group. The worker reads the first group\nfrom `jobs/jobs.json`, passes all jobs in the group to Claude as a single prompt, and\nchecks for a `<DONE>` signal in the output.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker exits successfully.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group remains in the queue for retry on the next\n  worker invocation.\n\nEach invocation starts with a clean context. You will not have memory of previous\ninvocations, so rely on the codebase, git history, and log files in `/repo/logs/` to\nunderstand what has already been done.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\n- Commit after every significant change (new feature, bug fix, refactor).\n- Write clear commit messages describing what changed and why.\n- Never commit code that fails typecheck or lint.\n","numLines":100,"startLine":1,"totalLines":100}}}

This worked but was inefficient. Not a directive violation per se, since the results were correct.\\n\\nNo corrections needed.

This worked but was inefficient. Not a directive violation per se, since the results were correct.\\n\\nNo corrections needed.

This worked but was inefficient. Not a directive violation per se, since the results were correct.\\n\\nNo corrections needed.

Let me summarize my review:\n\n**Iteration 2 (ce53730..4efb686):**\n- **Job**: Review 1 unreviewed log (`worker-2026-02-20T04-56-16-023Z.log`)\n- **Commits**: `de55c38` (review result) + `4efb686` (iteration marker)\n- **Changes**:\n  1. Moved `worker-2026-02-20T04-56-16-023Z.log` to `logs/reviewed/`\n  2. Fixed `src/status.ts` — two bugs: (a) false positive finish detection on JSON lines containing strings like `<DONE/>`, (b) container running check should take priority over finish signals in the status display\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Log review was thorough** — The agent properly used `npm run read-log`, examined the git diff between start/end revisions, read the strategy files, and provided a clear summary.\n\n2. **`src/status.ts` changes are sound**:\n   - Wrapping finish-signal checks with `if (!line.startsWith(\"{\"))` prevents JSON event lines from falsely triggering finish detection — good defensive fix.\n   - Prioritizing the `running` container check over `info.finished` in the status display is correct — if the container is still running, it should show \"RUNNING\" regardless of what finish strings appear in log content.\n\n3. **The `status.ts` change was uncommitted** — The agent noted it as a \"pre-existing uncommitted infrastructure fix\" and didn't commit it. Looking at the git diff, it IS part of the ce53730..4efb686 range, so it was committed as part of this iteration's work. This is fine.\n\n4. **No directive violations** in the review process or the changes.\n\nNo corrections needed. Let me move the log to reviewed.\n\u001b[35m$ mkdir -p /repo/logs/reviewed && mv /repo/logs/worker-2026-02-20T04-58-06-214Z.log /repo/logs/reviewed/\u001b[0m\nNow let me commit and verify.\n\u001b[35m$ git -C /repo status --short\u001b[0m\n\u001b[35m$ git -C /repo log --oneline -5\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2m M src/status.ts\n?? logs/reviewed/worker-2026-02-20T04-58-06-214Z.log\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2m4efb686 Agent iteration 2\nde55c38 Review worker log: iteration reviewed 11 sub-logs, no issues found\nce53730 Agent iteration 1\nd0c911e Review 11 worker logs: add strategy tips for OOM and infrastructure failures\n5105c52 change\u001b[0m\nThe `src/status.ts` modification is showing as uncommitted even though I see it in the diff for ce53730..4efb686.

This is a sound improvement: simpler, more reliable, and avoids the same false-positive problem that was fixed in the log parsing code in the previous iteration.\n\n**Review Assessment:**\n- The review process was thorough — used `npm run read-log`, checked git diffs between revisions, read the status.ts file, identified the uncommitted change and correctly included it\n- The `src/status.ts` change is sound — it improves reliability by using the actual container status rather than string matching on log content\n- No directive violations in the review or the code changes\n- No strategy updates needed — no difficulties encountered\n\nNo corrections needed.
