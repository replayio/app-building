There are 90 log files total. I need to:\n\n1. Create the analysis directory: `reports/report-testFailures-sales-crm-3-review-3-20260224-175633-analysis/`\n2. Break the log list into groups of ~10 logs each\n3. Queue AnalyzeGroup subtasks for each group\n\nLet me count - there are 90 log files. That would be 9 groups of 10. Let me organize them.\n\nWait, I should also check if `worker-current.log` should be included. It's probably the currently running log, so it may not be relevant. Let me include it anyway since the skill doesn't say to exclude it.\n\n\nActually, looking at the documentation, `worker-current.log` is the log for the work currently being done, so it might be the current session's log. I'll include it anyway since the skill says to list all log files. Now I'm organizing the 90 logs into 9 groups of about 10 each and starting to list them out.\n\nListing the first group of logs... I'm continuing to organize these worker logs into groups, finishing up the second batch and moving into the third set of timestamped entries. Continuing through the rest of Group 4 with more worker logs from late February 24th. Continuing to organize the remaining log files into groups, finishing up group 5 and moving into group 6 with the worker logs from late January through early February. Continuing through the log files from the next time window, spanning from late January into early February with another batch of worker logs that appear to be grouped similarly to the previous set. Continuing to organize the remaining log files into their respective groups, working through the timestamps to ensure proper distribution across the batches. I'm seeing there are 90 log files total, which breaks down into 9 groups of 10, so I'll set up the analysis directory and queue the tasks accordingly. The report will be named `report-testFailures-sales-crm-3-review-3-20260224-175633` and saved to `skills/review/reportTestFailures.md`, using relative paths from the repo root for the log files.","signature":"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
