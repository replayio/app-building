Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route.

Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings.

This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":122,"startLine":1,"totalLines":122}}}

Let me systematically go through each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecUserDetailPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in UserDetailPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\n\n\n4. Every clickable element needs its exact navigation target or action result specified in the test entry.\n5. Data mutations require test entries confirming persistence and verifying all side effects occur correctly.\n6. Button and control styling matters—if the mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test must verify that appearance.\n7. Modal dialogs need complete functional testing.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format.\n10. Backend integrations that users can configure need complete setup specifications.\n11. State-changing actions require tests verifying that other parts of the app update appropriately.\n\nNow I'm checking the UserDetailPage test entries against these directives. Looking at the UserDetailHeader component, I can see it displays a back button, avatar, name, email, join date, and three stats—Active Deals, Open Tasks, and Total Deals—but I need to verify each element has corresponding test coverage.\n\nScanning through the test entries, they cover the header display, the deals section with navigation to individual deal pages, the tasks section with status checkboxes and client links, and the activity section with relative timestamps and client navigation. For clickable elements, I'm verifying that each test specifies the exact navigation target or action result—the back button goes to /users, deal links go to /deals/:dealId, and task links go to /tasks/:taskId.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the back button's text \"Back to Team Members\" is actually verified in the test entry. The test just confirms the button is visible but doesn't explicitly check the label text, which seems like a gap given the directive that specific text and styling should be verified when shown in the mockup.\n\nActually, I see that UDP-HDR-02 does specify clicking the \"Back to Team Members\" button, so the text is accounted for there. The rest of the directives check out—no state mutations, no modals, and the test entries match what's actually displayed. Let me now systematically go through every visible element on the UserDetailPage to see if anything's missing from the test coverage.\n\nStarting with the UserDetailHeader, I can see the avatar image or initials aren't explicitly tested, but the name, email, join date, and all three stats (Active Deals, Open Tasks, Total Deals) are covered in UDP-HDR-01, along with the back button which is also tested in UDP-HDR-02. Moving to the UserDealsSection, the deal name, client name, and deal value are all tested in UDP-DL-01.\n\nFinishing up the deals section with the stage badge and deal link navigation both covered in UDP-DL-01. The UserTasksSection has solid coverage too—task completion status, title, client name, due date, and navigation are all tested. For UserActivitySection, the recent activity heading, relative dates, descriptions, and client name links are all accounted for across UDP-ACT-01 and UDP-ACT-02. The test spec looks comprehensive across all the major components.\n\nSince UserDetailPage is read-only, the testing scope is naturally more constrained. I'm wondering if there's a mismatch between the test entries and the actual implementation—the test says task links navigate to /tasks/:taskId, but I need to verify whether tasks actually have a dedicated detail page or if they're only shown in a list view. Let me check the app spec to confirm what the expected behavior should be.\n\nActually, looking at the routes and component code more carefully, the test spec says tasks navigate to /tasks/:taskId and the component creates links to /tasks/${task.id}, so that's consistent. I don't see any major violations in the test spec entries for UserDetailPage overall.\n\nLet me double-check the directive requirements though. The test entries need to indicate which components they're exercising—looking at them, they're properly grouped by UserDetailHeader, UserDealsSection, UserTasksSection, and UserActivitySection. And the directive also requires that every interactive element in the component has a comment in the JSX indicating which tests cover it. I should review the component files to see if those comments are actually present.\n\nChecking through the components, I notice the back button in UserDetailHeader is interactive but has no test reference comment next to it, same with the avatar. The deal links in UserDealsSection, task links in UserTasksSection, and client links in UserActivitySection all appear to be missing these annotations too. This requirement about JSX comments seems to apply to both the test spec and the component code itself—it's asking for annotations that tie interactive elements directly to their tests.\n\nLet me refocus on what I'm actually checking: the testSpec.md directives, not the requirements section. I need to review the specific directives listed to see which ones are being violated.\n\nFor UserDetailPage, most directives don't apply since there are no modals, attachments, imports, backend mutations, or state-changing actions. Looking at what remains—systematically inventorying elements, avoiding substitutions, specifying exact navigation targets, and verifying button/control appearance—the test entries seem to cover these adequately. All clickable elements have explicit navigation targets, and the visual elements like the back button and summary stats labels are accounted for. I'm checking the component description more carefully — the UserDetailHeader component explicitly lists all three stats (Active Deals, Open Tasks, Total Deals), and the test entry references this by name, so the coverage is actually complete. I don't see any violations of the test spec directives here.\n\nNow I'm moving on to verify that the UserDetailPage components satisfy the writeApp.md directives, starting with checking for proper data-testid attributes on interactive elements and containers. Continuing through the UserTasksSection, I'm verifying that each task has proper test identifiers and displays the relevant fields like title, client name, and due date with completion status.\n\nNow I'm checking the UserActivitySection to confirm it has the right test IDs on activity items, shows relative dates and descriptions with client name links pointing to the correct routes, and avoids native select elements.\n\nLet me verify the backend function and check if there are any specific requirements around tagged template literals in the users function, then confirm the header component is displaying email and join date as expected.\n\nLooking at the deals section, it's showing name, client, value, and stage as required. The tasks section displays title, client, and due date, though it also includes a completion status checkbox that the test spec doesn't explicitly mention—but that's a spec issue, not an implementation problem. The writeApp directive is to satisfy the test requirements, which it does.\n\nThe back button correctly navigates to /users as specified. Now I need to check the backend implementation and verify the neon SQL usage. I'm also noticing that the UserActivitySection has a client link without a data-testid attribute, which violates the directive requiring data-testid on all interactive elements.\n\nThe test currently targets this link using a CSS selector for href attributes, which works but doesn't follow the stated requirement. I should check if UserDealsSection and UserTasksSection follow the data-testid pattern more consistently. ActivitySection are interactive elements without data-testid, which is a clear violation of the directive. The stat calculations look correct though — activeDeals filters out closed deals, openTasks excludes completed ones, and totalDeals counts everything.

Let me check the backend against writeApp directives:\n\n1. **Tagged template literal syntax**: The backend uses `` sql`...` `` tagged template literal syntax for all queries. ✓\n2. **Path parsing**: `pathParts.length >= 4 ? pathParts[3] : null` — Let me check the directive: \"Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3\". Path: `/.netlify/functions/users/123` → split + filter: `['.netlify', 'functions', 'users', '123']` → index 3 = '123' ✓\n\n\n3. **Empty strings to null for DATE/UUID**: The userId comes from the URL path and is validated with `if (req.method === 'GET' && userId)`, so it's always truthy before being used in the query. ✓\n\nNow I'm checking for any other component directives I might have missed, particularly around the `data-testid` attributes. I already spotted that UserActivitySection is missing `data-testid` on the client links, so let me see if there are other similar issues.\n\nLooking at the task completion indicator in UserTasksSection, it's just a visual status dot without any interactive behavior, so it doesn't need a `data-testid`. The test doesn't interact with it anyway.\n\nSo the main violation I'm finding is that the client links in UserActivitySection don't have `data-testid` attributes, even though the directive requires all interactive elements to have them. The test gets around this by using a CSS selector instead.\n\nNow moving to Job 3, I need to check the UserDetailPage tests against the writeTests.md directives about navigation verification, side effect assertions, avoiding common text selectors, consistent `data-testid` values, file upload mechanics, and Playwright locator usage.\n\nLooking at the UDP-HDR-01 test, it navigates to /users and clicks a user card, then verifies the header and name are visible with testids. However, the test spec mentions email, join date, and summary stats should be displayed, but the test only checks for the header and name visibility—it's missing assertions for the email, join date, and the actual summary stats values. I need to reconsider whether this is actually a violation. The directive about editing and interacting with specific fields is narrowly scoped to cases where the spec describes actual interactions, not just observations. And while the test doesn't verify email, join date, and summary stats explicitly, the general principle seems to be about ensuring tests match their spec entries — but I should check if there's a broader expectation that all mentioned elements get verified, or if visibility checks alone are sufficient for observational specs. Checking directive 8 more carefully—it specifically applies to tests that edit or interact with fields, and UDP-HDR-01 is purely observational, so that directive doesn't apply here. The test is incomplete relative to the spec entry though, since it doesn't verify email, join date, or stats as described.\n\nNow moving through the other test cases: UDP-HDR-02 confirms navigation and arrival at the users page, satisfying directive 1. UDP-DL-01 checks that the deals section is visible with content.\n\nFor UDP-DL-01, the test verifies the deal link navigates correctly, but only checks for the deal name text without confirming that client name, value, or stage badge are actually visible—similar incomplete coverage as the header test. UDP-TSK-01 has the same pattern: it verifies the tasks section and navigation work, but doesn't fully validate all the fields mentioned in the spec like completion status, client name, or due date.\n\nUDP-ACT-01 checks for the activity section and heading, but the test doesn't actually verify that relative dates, descriptions, or client name links are displayed. UDP-ACT-02 correctly navigates to the client detail page using the href selector, satisfying directive 1, though I'm noticing directive 3 about avoiding getByText with common words might need closer examination.\n\nLooking through the test file, I don't see getByText being used anywhere—just getByTestId, locators with hasText, and CSS selectors, which aligns with the directives. The tests also avoid using .toPass() with auto-wait, and all the data-testid values match consistently between the tests and component code.\n\nNow I'm summarizing the violations I've found across all three files. The test spec itself looks solid with adequate coverage of visible elements and interactive components. In the app code, the client name links in the activity section are missing data-testid attributes, which violates the requirement for testids on interactive elements. And in the tests, the user detail header test doesn't verify email, join date, or summary stats even though the spec entry says they should be visible, and the deals test is similarly incomplete relative to its specification.\n\nBut I need to reconsider what actually counts as a directive violation versus just a test quality issue. Looking back at the actual directives — navigation verification, side effects assertions, avoiding getByText with common words, consistent testids, and file structure — most of these test gaps aren't actually directive violations. The navigation is properly verified, there are no side effects to assert on this read-only page, and the testid usage is consistent.\n\nThe real issue is directive 8 about exercising exact fields described in the spec. Even though the directive's wording focuses on editing interactions, the spirit is clear: if the spec describes something, the test should verify it completely, not just a subset. These incomplete tests do violate that principle.\n\nSo I'm identifying two main issues: missing data-testid attributes on activity client links (a component directive violation), and incomplete test assertions where tests don't verify all the elements their spec entries describe. These are connected—the component needs the testid, and the tests need to actually check what they claim to check. I should be conservative about what counts as a strict violation, but the incomplete assertions are definitely test quality issues worth fixing. Looking at the test code more carefully, I see that UDP-HDR-01 only verifies the header and name are visible, but skips checking for the email, join date, and stats that the spec requires. Similarly, UDP-ACT-01 just checks for the \"Recent Activity\" heading without validating that individual activity items actually contain dates, descriptions, or client links. Both tests fall short of what the writeTests directive expects, so I need to create fix jobs for these assertion
