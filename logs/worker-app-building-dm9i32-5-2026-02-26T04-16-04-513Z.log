Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me try a different approach - use `typeRoots` to add the app's node_modules to the type resolution, or better yet, just specify `rootDir` properly.\n\nActually, the real issue is simpler. When TypeScript compiles files from `../shared/`, it resolves node_modules relative to that directory. The fix is to create a symlink to node_modules in the shared directory, or better yet, just specify `typeRoots` to include the app's node_modules/@types.\n\nWait, let me think about this differently. The `moduleResolution: \"bundler\"` should walk up directories looking for node_modules. \n\nOh, I see the problem now - the shared directory is nested at `/repo/apps/shared/`, so TypeScript looks for node_modules in that directory, then its parents, but the packages are actually in `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/node_modules/`, which is a sibling directory that TypeScript won't find. Using `paths` should work with bundler resolution, so let me try configuring that properly instead.\n\nActually, the real issue is that when TypeScript resolves the `@shared/*` path alias to `../shared/store/store.ts`, it then needs to resolve the imports *within* that file like `@reduxjs/toolkit`, and with bundler module resolution it walks up the directory tree looking for node_modules - but it's starting from the shared directory, not the apps level where the packages actually live.\n\nThe fix options are installing packages higher up in the hierarchy, creating symlinks, or using path mappings to redirect the package imports. Let me reconsider the paths approach since that should theoretically work, but I'm realizing the error message was about a missing type definition file, which suggests something different is going on.\n\nActually, the simplest solution might be to just create a symlink or install dependencies at the `/repo/apps/` level instead of trying to work around the monorepo structure. But before I go that route, let me try using `typeRoots` in the tsconfig to explicitly tell TypeScript where to find type definitions, or revisit the paths configuration with wildcard patterns to see if that resolves the
