Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

Let me systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecOrderDetailsPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in OrderDetailsPage test entries\n\nI need to check the OrderDetailsPage test entries in docs/tests.md against the directives in testSpec.md.\n\nLet me review the testSpec.md directives:\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler alternatives for what's actually shown in the mockup—if the table needs computed columns or joins, I need to test all of them.\n4. Every clickable element requires a test that specifies exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers.\n5. When user actions change data, I need tests confirming the persistence and verifying all the correct side effects happen.\n6. Button styling, text, and icons matter—if the mockup shows specific details, the test should verify them.\n7. Modal dialogs need comprehensive testing to ensure they function properly.\n8. File upload functionality should be fully supported for attachments.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must declare the expected data format.\n10. State changes need tests that confirm other parts of the app update in response.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the OrderDetailsPage test entries and checking the OrderSummary section—I've got the basic display tests covered for Order ID, Supplier Name as a link, dates, status badge, and cost, plus the Edit Button opening the dialog with proper side effects and the Print Button triggering print. I still need to finish validating the Edit Order Dialog behavior.\n\nMoving into LineItemsTable, I'm verifying that the table displays correctly with all columns and row data, and that adding, editing, and deleting line items all work as expected with their side effects properly reflected in CostBreakdown and OrderHistory. The cancel and confirmation dialogs are also accounted for.\n\nNow I'm checking the CostBreakdown section to ensure it displays subtotal, tax with percentage, discount with label, and total cost with currency formatting.\n\nFor OrderDocuments, I need to verify the document list displays with details, view and download functionality work, and that uploading documents triggers the expected side effects while canceling the upload dialog prevents any changes.\n\nFinally, OrderHistory should show a timeline of all events with timestamps and descriptions, including entries created exactly once when status changes or line items are modified.\n\nNow I'm checking each clickable element against the spec to ensure navigation targets are explicitly defined—the supplier name links to the supplier detail page, edit buttons open dialogs, print triggers the print action, and action buttons like delete show confirmation dialogs before proceeding.\n\nFor data mutations, I'm verifying that edits persist to the database, line item changes update the cost breakdown and create history entries, and document uploads trigger the appropriate side effects. I also need to confirm that button styling matches the spec exactly—like the edit button showing a pencil icon with text, and the print button displaying a printer icon.\n\nModal dialogs need full coverage including open, save, cancel, and validation flows, and the document upload dialog correctly lets users select files and specify document type, which satisfies the upload requirements here. State-changing actions like line item modifications should cascade updates across the rest of the application.\n\nNow I'm checking the AppSpec.md to see if there are any missing test cases, particularly around search or filter controls on the OrderDetailsPage and whether fields like tax rate or discount in the CostBreakdown section should be

Let me systematically compare it against the test entries:\n\n**Breadcrumb**: Dashboard > Orders > Order #PO-2024-10-1234 ✓ (tested)\n\n**OrderSummary section**:\n- \"Order Summary\" heading ✓\n- \"Purchase Order #PO-2024-10-1234 Details\" subtitle ✓\n- Edit button (pencil icon + \"Edit\" text) ✓\n- Print button (printer icon + \"Print\" text) ✓\n- Supplier: \"Acme Corp\" with external link icon ✓\n\n\n- Order Date: Oct 26, 2024 ✓\n- Expected Delivery: Nov 15, 2024 ✓\n- Status: green checkmark + \"Approved\" ✓\n- Overall Cost: $12,450.00 ✓\n\n**Line Items section**:\n- \"Line Items\" heading ✓\n- Table columns: SKU, Item Name / Description, Qty, Unit Price, Line Total ✓\n- Three rows of data ✓\n- The mockup doesn't show an \"Add Item\" button, though the test spec includes it—that's acceptable since it's an extra feature beyond the core requirements.\n\n**Cost Breakdown section**:\n- \"Cost Breakdown\" heading ✓\n- Subtotal: $12,250.00 ✓\n- Tax (8%): $980.00 ✓\n- Discount (Contract Pricing): -$780.00 ✓\n- Total Cost: $12,450.00 (USD) ✓\n\n**Documents section**:\n- \"Documents\" heading ✓\n- Three documents with file icon, name, type, date ✓\n- View text button ✓\n- Download icon button ✓\n- Upload Document button is missing from the mockup but was added as a necessary feature.\n\n**Order History section**:\n- \"Order\" heading visible, checking the rest of the section details.\n- Vertical timeline with four entries, each with timestamps and descriptions ✓\n- Different icons for each event type ✓\n\nNow I'm noticing the documents in the mockup have file-type-specific icons—the PDFs show document icons, while the PNG shows an image icon. The test spec doesn't explicitly verify these file-type-specific icons, though the writeApp.md directive does mention they should be displayed. This is a component-level detail rather than something the test spec needs to validate.\n\nThe test spec looks comprehensive overall. I've verified all visible elements have corresponding tests, the table includes all required columns with computed values, the cost breakdown shows subtotal, tax, discount, and total with currency formatting, and every clickable element has a specified navigation target—supplier names link to supplier pages, the edit button opens a dialog, print triggers the browser dialog, and the view button navigates to the document.\n\nFor data mutations, I'm confirming that edits, line item additions, modifications, and deletions all persist correctly and trigger OrderHistory entries, while cost breakdowns update accordingly. Document uploads also persist with history tracking. The button styling is accounted for with proper icons and labels.\n\nNow I'm working through the modal dialog testing—verifying that edit order, add/edit line item, delete confirmation, and document upload dialogs all handle open, save, cancel, and validation states properly. File uploads are functional in the document dialog, though I'm noticing the upload dialog doesn't explicitly specify which file types are accepted, which seems to conflict with the requirement that import dialogs should clearly indicate expected formats.\n\nFor state-changing actions, I'm confirming that line item modifications trigger cost breakdown updates and history entries, status changes create exactly one history entry, and document uploads also log to history. I'm also reconsidering whether the different file type icons shown in the mockup (like the image icon for the PNG file) need systematic testing to ensure they display correctly for various document types. Looking at the mockup more carefully, I can see the document list actually displays file-type-specific icons — the PDF files show document icons while the PNG shows an image icon. But the test entries just describe them generically as \"a file icon,\" which seems like it might be glossing over this detail from the writeApp.md directive about showing type-specific icons or thumbnails. I'm noticing the test entries use generic \"file icon\" language, but the mockup actually shows file-type-specific icons—and there's already a writeApp.md directive supporting this. The testSpec.md directive requires inventorying every visible element, so the test should specify file-type-specific icons rather than generic ones. This is a minor violation worth flagging.\n\nLooking at the actual document entries in the mockup, they do correctly specify the document types and dates, so that part checks out. Now I'm systematically reviewing the OrderSummary section to verify all test entries are present and accurate.\n\nContinuing through the LineItemsTable tests, I can see the full set covering display, add, edit, and delete operations with proper validation and cancellation flows. Moving into the CostBreakdown section, I'm checking the tax and subtotal display entries.\n\nFor the OrderDocuments tests, there's a potential issue flagged where the file icon test is too generic and doesn't account for different file types. The rest of the document tests cover viewing, downloading, and uploading functionality. Now I'm looking at the OrderHistory tests, which verify the timeline display, event details, and history entry creation on status changes.\n\nI need to double-check against the testSpec requirements about clickable elements and button appearance. The View and Download buttons already specify their exact behaviors—opening in a new tab and downloading to the device respectively. Looking at the mockup, I should verify that buttons match their visual design, like the Edit button which should show a pencil icon alongside the text.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the document file-type icons represent a violation of the inventory requirement, since the testSpec asks for a systematic accounting of every visible element including icons and badges.\n\nThe mockup does show file-type-specific icons next to each document, but the test entry only says \"each showing a file icon\" without that specificity. Though the \"Display Document Details\" entry does list file names with extensions, which hints at different types. This feels like a minor gap rather than a real violation since the writeApp.md directive about file-type-specific icons is more of an implementation concern than a testSpec inventory issue.\n\nI should also verify whether the mockup includes an \"Add Item\" button for line items—I don't see one there, but the test spec appears to reference adding items. The document upload feature doesn't explicitly specify accepted file types, but since this is a general document upload rather than structured data import, the directive's examples about required columns and accepted values may not strictly apply here. Let me double-check what the directive says about mutations to make sure there are no other compliance issues.\n\nLooking at the history entries for each action—editing the order status creates exactly one entry, and adding, editing, or deleting line items each create a new history entry, but none of them explicitly verify that only one entry is created per action rather than duplicates. I'm noticing the individual action tests don't explicitly say \"exactly one,\" but the dedicated test entries do specify that constraint for status changes and line item modifications. For document uploads, there's no dedicated \"exactly one\" test, though the phrasing \"a new entry is added\" (singular) might be implicitly sufficient—though I'm not entirely convinced that's clear enough.\n\nLooking back at the mockup, I don't see a \"Back to Dashboard\" button on the OrderDetailsPage like there is on SupplierDetailsPage, so there's no missing test entry there. The breadcrumb navigation covers that need. Overall, the test entries seem comprehensive and aligned with the spec.\n\nWait, I should double-check the directive about state-changing actions and reciprocal relationships. When an order's status changes, the UpcomingOrdersTable on the Dashboard should update, but that's really a Dashboard test concern, not an OrderDetailsPage test. Similarly, if a line item changes and affects the UpcomingOrdersTable's Total Cost column, that's a cross-page interaction that would belong in Dashboard tests. The CostBreakdown updating when line items change is already covered, so I think the OrderDetailsPage tests are appropriately scoped.\n\nActually, I'm noticing something about the history entry tests—the \"History Entry Created on Status Change\" test verifies exactly one entry is added, while the \"Edit Button Opens Edit Dialog\" test also creates a history entry but doesn't explicitly check the \"exactly one\" constraint. These are complementary rather than redundant. But looking at the document upload test, it says a new entry is added to OrderHistory but doesn't verify the \"exactly one\" requirement like the status change test does. The directive seems to require that constraint for state-changing actions, so there might be a gap there.\n\nThat said, I think this is minor—\"a new entry is added\" reasonably implies one entry, and the line item modification test already covers the more complex deduplication scenario. I'll consider the test spec review complete with no significant

Starting with OrderDetailsPage.tsx, I can see the padding directive is applied consistently across multiple lines with the `page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3` class, and I'm checking for proper test IDs.\n\nChecking OrderSummary.tsx next — I'm verifying that all interactive elements and containers have appropriate test IDs, including the root container, edit and print buttons, supplier link, field containers, status badge, overall cost display, and the edit modal. Checking the LineItemsTable component—it has all the necessary test identifiers for the section container, add button, table structure, individual rows and cells, edit/delete buttons, the modal, and form fields.\n\nNow I'm verifying the CostBreakdown component has test IDs for the root element and each cost line item like subtotal, tax, discount, and total, and checking OrderDocuments similarly... I'm finishing up the test ID verification for the download button, then checking the upload modal and empty state attributes. I've confirmed the file-type-specific icons are working with different formats, the file input uses a proper ref, and there's a custom dropdown instead of the native select element. Now I need to verify the OrderHistory component is using the shared TimelineSection and check if there are any issues with the searchable select/dropdown implementation in modals.\n\nLooking at the EditOrderModal and LineItemModal, neither actually needs a searchable dropdown since they're not referencing other entities—the status dropdown is just a fixed set of options and SKU is free-text input. I should also verify that components aren't adding unnecessary padding or margins to their root elements.\n\nChecking the component roots, they all use `className=\"section-card\"` without any padding or margin classes, which is correct. The page layout has the Order Summary spanning full width at the top, then a two-column layout below with Line Items and Cost Breakdown on the left side and Documents and Order History on the right.\n\nLooking at the actual component order in OrderDetailsPage.tsx, I need to verify if there's CSS handling the two-column grid layout for those bottom

The `page-content` class already has padding set via CSS. But the OrderDetailsPage also adds `p-6 max-sm:p-3` as Tailwind classes. These might conflict with the CSS padding. Let me check... \n\nWait, looking at the writeApp.md directive: \"Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\". The page does have `className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\"`. But there's also CSS padding on `.page-content` (24px). If Tailwind's `p-6` is 24px (1.5rem = 24px) and max-sm:p-3 is 12px (0.75rem = 12px), these match the CSS. So while they might be redundant, they're not wrong. Both the CSS and Tailwind classes specify the same padding values. \n\nThat's not actually a problem. Now looking at the OrderDetailsPage structure, I notice the mockup shows a two-column layout below the breadcrumb and order summary—line items and cost breakdown on the left, documents and order history on the right—but the current implementation just renders these components sequentially without any grid or flex wrapper to create that side-by-side arrangement.\n\nThe directive specifically requires matching the visual appearance to the mockup, including section layouts, so if the page is stacking these vertically instead of in columns, that would violate the requirement. Let me examine the actual OrderDetailsPage code to see how it's currently structured.

[2026-02-27T04:50:07.113Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01PdfsTFYqjgoVLjDeHNFA5X","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The page doesn't have a two-column layout. The sections are just stacked vertically. Looking at the mockup, I can clearly see:\n- Line Items and Cost Breakdown on the LEFT (taking about 60% width)\n- Documents and Order History on the RIGHT (taking about 40% width)\n\nThe current implementation renders everything in a single column stacked layout. This violates the writeApp.md directive: \"Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\"\n\nHowever, this is a layout concern at the page level, not at the component level. \n\nI need to check if the OrderDetailsPage.tsx has the proper grid or flex wrapper to create this two-column layout, or if there's CSS I'm missing. Looking back at the mockup, the left and right column arrangement is definitely intentional and a clear visual mismatch from what's currently being rendered.\n\nThe `section-card` component has `margin-bottom: 16px` with no width constraints, so everything stacks vertically in the page-content. The mockup explicitly shows a two-column layout for the lower sections, and since the writeApp.md directive specifically calls out \"section layouts (horizontal vs vertical)\" as something that must match the mockup, this is a legitimate violation I need to flag.\n\nLet me also check the `data-testid` requirements more carefully to see if there are other directive violations I'm missing.\n\nGoing through each component, I'm verifying that interactive elements, containers, and list items all have proper testids. OrderSummary, LineItemsTable, and CostBreakdown all look good. OrderDocuments is covered too. For OrderHistory, the root container has its testid, but I need to check whether the TimelineSection shared component is handling testids correctly for the timeline events.\n\nActually, since this is a per-page task, I don't need to verify shared components—those should be checked separately. I'm also confirming there are no native `<select>` elements anywhere; both OrderSummary and OrderDocuments use custom dropdowns instead. Finally, checking the layout-agnostic principle: all the main components use `section-card` class without outer padding, which keeps them flexible for different layouts.\n\nNow I'm questioning whether the `margin-bottom: 16px` on `section-card` violates the spacing rule—it's defined globally rather than per-component, and it's a shared convention for spacing between sections, so it might be acceptable even though technically the component is controlling its own spacing rather than letting the parent handle it.\n\nThe main issue I'm finding is that the OrderDetailsPage layout doesn't match the mockup: it renders sections vertically in a single column, but the mockup clearly shows a two-column layout with Line Items and Cost Breakdown on the left (about 60% width) and Documents and Order History on the right (about 40% width).\n\nI'm double-checking the CSS to see if there's any flex or grid layout I might have missed. The `.page-content` class only has `flex: 1` and padding, which just makes it grow within its parent container—it doesn't establish a flex or grid context for its children. The sections are just stacked vertically with margin-bottom spacing, so this is definitely a layout violation against the directive to match the mockup's section layouts.\n\nNow I'm examining the OrderSummary component more closely. The mockup displays all the summary fields—Supplier, Order Date, Expected Delivery, Status, and Overall Cost—in a single horizontal row, but I need to verify if the component actually renders them that way. Looking at the OrderSummary.tsx file, there's an `order-summary-grid` wrapper, so I should check what the CSS does with

The mockup shows 5 fields in a single horizontal row: Supplier, Order Date, Expected Delivery, Status, Overall Cost. But the CSS grid uses `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr` which is 3 columns. So the 5 fields would wrap to two rows:\n- Row 1: Supplier, Order Date, Expected Delivery\n- Row 2: Status, Overall Cost\n\nBut the mockup shows all 5 in one row. Hmm, actually looking at the mockup more carefully, it seems like the fields ARE in one row or at least visually appear that way with varying widths. Let me look again...\n\n\nActually, examining the mockup more closely, all five fields do appear on the same horizontal line with different column widths, but the current grid is set to only 3 columns, which would cause wrapping. This seems like a layout mismatch with the mockup, though I need to check if this violates the directive about matching visual appearance.\n\nThe directive does mention prioritizing consistent styling over exact adherence to mockup images, so a 3-column responsive layout might be intentional rather than a violation. Without more context about the overall design system, I should note this as a potential discrepancy but acknowledge it could be a deliberate choice for better responsiveness across screen sizes.\n\nThe more significant issue is the page-level structure—the OrderDetailsPage stacking all sections vertically when the mockup clearly shows a two-column layout with Line Items and Cost Breakdown on the left, Documents and Order History on the right. That's a structural violation worth flagging.\n\nLet me search for any CSS grid rules on the page-content or order-details-page classes that might be creating the intended two-column layout.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2701,"cache_read_input_tokens":82988,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2701,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"416bdcce-178c-43a1-8345-33c5c43b5e4e","uuid":"b3cacf43-733c-47f6-ab42-b5f03de04212"}

I should also verify the `overflow: hidden` directive isn't clipping any absolutely-positioned elements like dropdowns or modals—the modals use fixed positioning over the viewport, so they shouldn't be affected, but I need to check if the status selector dropdown in the Edit Order Modal has any positioning issues.\n\nChecking the modal and filter-select CSS...","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":889,"cache_read_input_tokens":85689,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":889,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"416bdcce-178c-43a1-8345-33c5c43b5e4e","uuid":"242d094d-8ed6-463b-97f9-b74fc59b6c6a"}

[2026-02-27T04:51:23.852Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01WnDcq3ki4bDzEBFoje99j9","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The TimelineSection shared component has good `data-testid` attributes. Now let me check the sort order. The directive test entry says \"reverse chronological order (newest first).\" The TimelineSection sorts by timestamp descending (newest first) on line 96: `(a, b) => new Date(b.timestamp).getTime() - new Date(a.timestamp).getTime()`. But wait, the `event.timestamp` is already formatted as a string via `formatDateTime(entry.created_at)` in OrderHistory. So when the TimelineSection sorts, it's sorting by `new Date(\"Oct 30, 2024, 10:30 AM\")` which might not parse correctly depending on the format...\n\n\nActually, modern browsers handle that date format fine, so this isn't a directive violation. The document event type in OrderHistory maps to \"note\" which gives it the right icon in TimelineSection, matching the document-like icon shown in the mockup for the \"Invoice received and linked\" entry.\n\nLooking at all the timeline icons, they're mapping correctly: the status change gets an arrow, the invoice gets a document icon, the approval gets a checkmark, and the order creation gets a circle icon. The main issue I'm finding is that OrderDetailsPage stacks everything vertically instead of using the two-column layout shown in the mockup, which goes against the writeApp.md directive about layout structure. matching section layouts.\n\nAre there other violations? Let me review the full list of writeApp.md directives one more time:\n\n1. ✓ Run npm run check from app directory\n2. ✓ Test entries are satisfied by app code (all components render what's expected)\n3. ⚠️ Match visual appearance - section layout is a two-column grid in mockup but single column in code\n4. ✓ data-testid on all interactive elements\n5. ✓ netlify.toml base setting (process, not component-level)\n6. ✓ Neon tagged template syntax (backend, not component-level)\n7. ✓ Empty strings to null for dates (backend)\n8. ✓ Netlify Functions path index (backend)\n9. ✓ Searchable select/dropdown for entity references (no entity references in modals)\n10. ✓ No duplicate navigation links (not relevant to OrderDetailsPage components)\n11. ✓ No native HTML <select> elements\n12. ✓ File-type-specific icons in OrderDocuments\n13. ✓ Actual file uploads in OrderDocuments\n14. ✓ Page padding p-6 max-sm:p-3\n\nLooking at the OrderSummary fields grid with its three-column layout, the five fields would wrap across two rows, but the mockup displays them all horizontally in a single row. This is a minor visual discrepancy, though the testSpec emphasizes prioritizing consistent navigation. The OrderSummary grid layout is part of the same section layout issue—the mockup shows all 5 fields in a single row, but the 3-column grid splits them across 2 rows. While this could be justified for responsive design, it's still a deviation from the mockup's visual structure.

[2026-02-27T04:53:31.420Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_018bwLzSSvSfYJ855Njczrto","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me check each test file against the writeTests.md directives:\n\n**writeTests.md directives:**\n\n1. **Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click**\n2. **When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages, tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back**\n3. **For actions that produce side effects, write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once**\n4. **Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings. Prefer `getByTestId`**\n\n\n5. **All `data-testid` values used across all test files must be consistent**\n6. **When the test spec entry describes file upload, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (setInputFiles)**\n7. **NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside a `.toPass()` retry block**\n8. **Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach`**\n9. **Use generous timeouts for assertions that depend on backend round-trips**\n10. **For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test, add `test.slow()`**\n11. **For deployment tests: use data-testid values that match**\n12. **When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field, the test must exercise that exact field**\n13. **Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test** (not relevant to OrderDetailsPage)\n14. **Auth flows that involve email-based verification must have dedicated tests** (not relevant)\n\nNow I'm going through the order-details-summary.spec.ts file to verify each test follows these guidelines. The \"Display Order ID in Header\" test uses getByTestId consistently and validates the heading and subtitle text. The \"Display Supplier Name as Link\" test checks that navigation works correctly with an extended timeout for the URL assertion, and also relies on getByTestId for element selection.\n\nThe remaining tests all follow the same pattern—they use getByTestId to locate elements, verify the correct content is displayed, and validate formatting where applicable. The \"Edit Button Opens Edit Dialog\" test is marked as slow since it involves multiple steps, and it confirms the button text, opens the modal, updates the status, and saves the changes.\n\nNow I'm checking the tests against the directives to ensure they meet the requirements. The \"Display Supplier Name as Link\" test verifies that clicking the supplier link navigates to the correct URL pattern and that the supplier details page loads properly.\n\nFor the side effects directive, the \"Edit Button Opens Edit Dialog\" test confirms a history entry is created when the status changes, though it doesn't explicitly count that exactly one entry was added—that's covered by the dedicated history test in the separate spec file, so this is acceptable.\n\nI'm also verifying that the selectors avoid using `getByText()` with common words, and this file uses `getByTestId()` throughout, which is good.\n\nMoving through the remaining directives: there's no `.toPass()` usage, no unnecessary `beforeEach` hooks, all backend assertions have 30-second timeouts, and the multi-step test uses `test.slow()`.\n\nNow I'm checking the line items spec file, which verifies the table columns by their headers and validates each row's cell data using test IDs, including currency formatting.\n\nFor the \"Display Multiple Line Items\" test, I'm noticing it checks for exactly 3 rows using `toHaveCount(3)`. This could violate the directive about not relying on fixed record counts, but since it's checking line items for a specific order with seeded data, and the test runs before the \"Add Line Item\" test that would modify the count, it should be fine in practice. there's a more fundamental issue: the Parallel Test Design section says \"Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records in the database.\" While this is specifically about tests that CREATE/MODIFY/DELETE, the \"Display Multiple Line Items\" test itself doesn't modify records - it just reads. The concern is that other tests in the same worker might have modified the count. Since this test runs first in the describe block (before Add/Edit/Delete tests), and these tests share a worker, the count should be accurate.\n\nActually, looking at the test more carefully: `await expect(rows).toHaveCount(3, { timeout: 30000 })` - This asserts exactly 3 rows. If the \"Add Line Item\" test from the cost-breakdown spec runs first (different describe block, same worker potentially), it could add items to the same order, making this fail. But tests across different spec files may run in different workers with different databases, and within this spec file the tests run sequentially, so this is borderline but acceptable since it's asserting the seed data count for a specific order rather than a global count.\n\nNow looking at the \"Add Line Item\" test - it counts the initial rows, adds an item, and verifies the count increases by one using a relative assertion, which is the right approach. It also verifies the new row data, checks the CostBreakdown update, and confirms exactly one new history entry was created. The \"Edit Line Item\" test has the slow marker as well. - Changes quantity, saves, verifies update ✓\n- Checks history entry (exactly one new) ✓\n- Checks CostBreakdown update ✓\n\n**Test: \"Delete Line Item\"**\n- Has `test.slow()` ✓\n- Verifies confirmation dialog ✓\n- Confirms deletion, checks count decreased ✓\n- Uses `page.getByTestId(\"line-item-row\").filter({ hasText: itemName }).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 })` - good atomic assertion ✓\n- Checks history entry (exactly one new) ✓\n\n**Test: \"Add Line Item Dialog Cancel Does Not Add Item\"**\n- Enters data, cancels, verifies count unchanged ✓\n- Checks cancelled item not in list ✓\n\n**Test: \"Add Line Item Dialog Validation\"**\n- Tries to save without required field, checks error ✓\n\n**Test: \"Edit Line Item Dialog Cancel Does Not Modify Item\"**\n- Records original values, changes, cancels, verifies unchanged ✓\n\n**Test: \"Delete Line Item Confirmation Dismiss Does Not Delete Item\"**\n- Opens confirmation, clicks cancel, verifies item remains ✓\n\nNow checking for directive violations: no `.toPass()` usage, no `getByText()` calls, and all side effects (add, edit, delete) are properly isolated with single executions and history count verification.\n\nMoving to the cost breakdown file - all tests use `getByTestId` exclusively with generous timeouts, and the multi-step flow has `test.slow()` applied correctly.\n\nChecking the documents file now - examining test coverage for display, details, and multiple document scenarios. `count >= 3` (relative assertion) ✓\n\n**Test: \"View Button Opens Document\"**\n- Opens in new tab, verifies URL exists ✓\n\n**Test: \"Download Button Downloads Document\"**\n- Listens for download event, verifies filename ✓\n\n**Test: \"Upload Document\"**\n- Has `test.slow()` ✓\n- Uses `setInputFiles` for actual file upload ✓ (directive 6)\n- Verifies upload dialog, file name display, document type selection ✓\n- Verifies document appears in list ✓\n- Verifies exactly one new history entry ✓\n\n**Test: \"Upload Document Dialog Cancel Does Not Upload\"**\n- Creates file, sets input, opens dialog, cancels, verifies count unchanged ✓\n\nNow checking the order-details-history spec file. The timeline display test confirms the section is visible with proper title and at least one event. Event details are validated for non-empty timestamps and descriptions, and I'm verifying that all history entries render with their icons and metadata intact. The status change test is checking that new entries get created when the order status updates. Verifying that all test identifiers are consistently applied across the different spec files—order-details-page, order-summary, line-items-section, line-item-row, add-line-item-btn, line-item-modal, cost-breakdown, order-documents, order-history, and timeline-event all appear where they should.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the edit dialog test fully covers the spec requirements—specifically whether changing the expected delivery date needs to be tested in the same test case as the status change, or if testing both fields for visibility plus separate validation tests is sufficient. exercises the status field but skips testing the expected delivery date field entirely—that's the gap the directive specifically warns against.\n\nFor the Timeline Entry Icons test, I'm checking the actual test code to see if it validates the icon-to-event-type mapping properly, or if it just confirms that different icons exist without verifying they match their corresponding event types. The assertion checking for at least one distinct icon class is pretty weak—with multiple event types in the test data, I should really be verifying at least two different classes to confirm the icons actually vary by type. That said, visual verification in E2E tests is inherently tricky, so I'll accept this as reasonable. Let me verify there are no `.toPass()` blocks or `getByText()` calls anywhere in the test files to make sure everything aligns with the testing directives.\n\nNow I'm noticing a more significant issue: the \"Edit Button Opens Edit Dialog\" test only validates editing the status field, but the spec says the dialog should allow editing both status and expected delivery date. According to the writeTests.md guidelines, each described interaction needs to be tested for all relevant fields. I should also check whether the \"Display Multiple Line Items\" test's fixed count assertion violates the parallel test design principle about not relying on hardcoded record counts.\n\nLooking at the test isolation more carefully, while tests within a describe block run in order and different spec files use separate database branches in parallel workers, sequential execution within the same worker could cause cross-file interference. The \"Add Line Item\" test modifies the same order that other tests reference, which could affect count assertions if test execution order shifts.\n\nBut this is really a test design issue rather than a directive violation—the \"Display Multiple Line Items\" test itself doesn't modify records, and the parallel worker isolation means this is acceptable. Let me wrap up my analysis for Subtask 3.\n\nI'm finding a real violation: the \"Edit Button Opens Edit Dialog\" test only checks the order status field, but the spec says both status and expected delivery date are editable. The writeTests.md directive requires testing each interaction described in the spec, so I need to flag this and add a
