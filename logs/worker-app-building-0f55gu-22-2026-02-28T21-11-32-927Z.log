Dashboard link scrolls to top; Suppliers/Orders/Inventory links scroll to their respective sections.\n\n2. **`SuppliersList.tsx`** (line 22): Added `id=\"suppliers\"` to the root div so `/#suppliers` hash navigation has a scroll target.\n\n3. **`UpcomingOrdersTable.tsx`** (line 44): Added `id=\"orders\"` to the root div so `/#orders` hash navigation has a scroll target.\n\n4. **`docs/tests.md`**: Updated test spec entries to reflect scrolling behavior (e.g., \"Click Suppliers Nav Link Scrolls to Suppliers Section\").\n\n### RunTests\nAll dashboard tests pass: 34 tests across 3 spec files (dashboard-suppliers-list: 11, dashboard-upcoming-orders: 13, dashboard-quick-actions: 10).

The issue is likely cold start of the Vite server. Let me change the navigation to use `domcontentloaded` instead of `networkidle`, which is more resilient with the Replay browser, and add a `test.slow()` for the cold start.\n[edit] /repo/apps/SupplierTracker/tests/supplier-details-tab-links.spec.ts\n$ npm run test tests/supplier-details-tab-links.spec.ts 2>&1\nLet me first verify the existing tests pass to rule out an infrastructure issue.\n$ npm run test tests/supplier-details-overview.spec.ts 2>&1\n[TaskOutput]\nThe existing tests also fail with the same navigation timeout.

Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n## Summary\n\n### Subtask 1: FixViolationSupplierDetailsTabLinks\n\n**Violation**: The three SupplierDetailsPage section-level tab link buttons (Documents, Comments, Orders) that scroll to their respective sections when clicked had no dedicated test entries, violating the testSpec.md directive to \"inventory every visible element.\"\n\n**Changes made:**\n\n1. **`docs/tests.md`** — Added a new `### SectionTabLinks` subsection under SupplierDetailsPage with 4 test entries:\n   - **Display Section Tab Links** — Verifies all three tab buttons are visible\n   - **Click Documents Tab Scrolls to Documents Section** — Verifies clicking Documents tab scrolls to that section\n   - **Click Comments Tab Scrolls to Comments Section** — Verifies clicking Comments tab scrolls to that section\n   - **Click Orders Tab Scrolls to Orders Section** — Verifies clicking Orders tab scrolls to that section\n\n2. **`src/pages/SupplierDetailsPage.tsx`** — Added JSX comments next to each interactive tab button element referencing the test entries that exercise them.\n\n3. **`tests/supplier-details-tab-links.spec.ts`** — Created new Playwright test file implementing all 4 test entries, following the exact same patterns as the existing `supplier-details-overview.spec.ts`.\n\n### Subtask 2: RunTests\n\nTypecheck passes. The Playwright tests follow the identical pattern used by existing test files. Test runs fail with navigation timeouts — this is a pre-existing infrastructure issue with the Replay Chromium browser (confirmed by running the existing `supplier-details-overview.spec.ts` which also fa...

Let me now process each one and write the analysis files. Let me summarize what happened in each log:\n\n**Log 116**: FixViolationTasksListAssigneeRole for SalesCRM - Added role column to users table, updated backend to return assigneeRole, updated TaskCardList to show role. All 20 sidebar tests pass. No test failures.\n\n**Log 117**: FixViolationTasksListFollowerNotifications for SalesCRM - Added follower notification pattern to tasks.ts POST handler. Type check and lint pass. No Playwright tests cover this feature. No test failures.\n \n**Log 118**: FixViolationNavDuplicateLinks for SupplierTracker - Fixed TopNavBar onClick handlers to use hash-based scrolling. 34 dashboard tests passed, though supplier-details-overview had some infrastructure timeouts that appear to be pre-existing socket errors rather than caused by these changes.\n\n**Log 119**: FixViolationSupplierDetailsTabLinks for SupplierTracker -  Added test entries for tab links in a new test file, but all tests hit navigation timeouts—both the new ones and existing tests—pointing to the same pre-existing infrastructure issue.\n\n**Log 12**: Unpack: Check directive compliance for SupplierTracker - Simple unpack with no code changes or test runs.\n\n**Log 120**: FixViolationSupplierDetailsModalTests for SupplierTracker - Added test entries for the Edit Supplier modal and Upload Document dialog, but again all tests failed with navigation timeouts from the same infrastructure problem.\n\n**Log 13**: Unpack: Polish app quality for SupplierTracker - Created MakeResponsive tasks without any code changes or tests.\n\n**Log 14**: MakeResponsive for SupplierTracker - Made all three pages responsive with CSS updates and confirmed type checking passes, though no test runs since these were styling-only changes.\n\n**Log 15**: Unpack: Deploy to production for SupplierTracker - Created DoDeploy and TestDeploy tasks without running tests.\n\n**Log 16**: DoDeploy and TestDeploy for SupplierTracker - Deployed to Netlify and ran the deployment test successfully with no failures.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the logs more carefully to identify actual test failures. Looking at the test results: Log 116 shows all 20 tests passed with zero failures, Log 117 had no tests run for that feature, and Log 118 shows the dashboard tests passed but supplier-details-overview encountered infrastructure issues with socket errors.\n\nThe agent correctly identified that the 5 failures in supplier-details-overview were infrastructure-related timeouts rather than code issues, so they didn't attempt to debug them. The dashboard itself had 34 passing tests across three runs. The subsequent logs show a pattern of infrastructure failures rather than actual test breakage—logs 119 and 120 both have navigation timeout issues across multiple test files, which are clearly environmental problems rather than failures caused by the agent's changes. I should now write out the analysis files for all 10 logs, grouping them efficiently to document which ones have genuine test failures versus infrastructure issues.","signature":"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

The new tests the agent wrote experienced the same infrastructure problem as the existing ones, so they're not distinct failures.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3059,"cache_read_input_tokens":62419,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3059,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0b0b0fe1-3a73-443b-9204-4303af7be8c8","uuid":"89a6cafc-d0ef-4f10-83f4-49d2bdf95fa7"}
