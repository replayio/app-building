This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   175→   on what you found.\n   176→\n   177→### Bug Writeup Template\n   178→\n   179→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   180→\n   181→```\n   182→# Bug: <test name>\n   183→\n   184→## Step 1: Evidence\n   185→\n   186→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   187→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   188→no evidence.>\n   189→\n   190→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   191→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   192→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   193→\n   194→## Step 2: Determination\n   195→\n   196→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   197→\n   198→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   199→\n   200→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   201→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   202→```\n   203→\n   204→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   205→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   206→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   207→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   208→\n   209→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   210→\n   211→## Directives\n   212→\n   213→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   214→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   215→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   216→\n   217→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   218→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   219→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   220→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→\n   222→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   223→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   224→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   225→\n   226→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   227→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   228→\n   229→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   230→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   231→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   232→\n   233→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   234→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   235→\n   236→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   237→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   238→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   239→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   240→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   241→\n   242→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   243→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   244→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   245→\n   246→## Tips\n   247→\n   248→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   249→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   250→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   251→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   252→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   253→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   254→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   255→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   256→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   257→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   258→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   259→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   260→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   261→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   262→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   263→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   264→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   265→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   266→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   267→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   268→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   269→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   270→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   271→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   272→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   273→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   274→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   275→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   276→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   277→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   278→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   279→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   280→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   281→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   282→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":289,"startLine":1,"totalLines":289}}}

Do not fix them immediately.\n\nExample:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\" \\\n  --job \"FixViolation: Fix <violation description>\" \\\n  --job \"RunTests: Verify tests pass after fix\" \\\n  --job \"DocumentFix: Document the fix\"\n```\n\n## Fixing violations\n\nFix the relevant documentation / code to make sure it is not violating the directives.\nMake sure to update anything else affected by the changes you are making, in `docs/tests.md`, the app code,\nand playwright tests.\n\n## Running tests\n\nMake sure all tests pass. Read `strategies/jobs/build/testing.md` to understand how to run tests and debug failures.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Group related fix tasks into a single FixViolation job when they share the same root cause\n  (e.g. \"FixViolationMissingTestIds\" for all modals missing data-testid attributes).\n","numLines":56,"startLine":1,"totalLines":56}}}

They want me to create jobs in the job queue that will generate a test failure report\n2. The report should cover all logs\n\nI need to figure out the right strategy to use. There doesn't seem to be a pre-existing strategy for \"test failure report\" generation. Let me check if there's something I'm missing, and understand the structure better.\n\nLooking at the log files, there are many worker logs in `/repo/logs/`. The user wants a test failure report from these logs.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The request is to \"queue jobs to generate a test failure report for all logs.\" This means I need to:\n\n\n1. Create a strategy for generating test failure reports from the logs\n2. Use `add-group` to queue jobs that will execute this strategy\n\nSince there's no existing strategy for this, I should write one first, then queue the jobs to process all the logs. I need to create a job strategy for processing the logs rather than just a message strategy, then queue jobs using the `add-group` pattern from AGENTS.md. The jobs should read each log file, identify test failures, and compile them into a report, so I'll batch the ~88 logs into manageable groups for the worker to process.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1084,"cache_read_input_tokens":33393,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1084,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"fc5abb55-616d-44c9-92c3-4467d05a74de","uuid":"0467948e-dc3f-47a0-81f5-aa64f7870f69"}

The user wants me to queue jobs that will analyze all 88 log files and generate a test failure report. I need to:\n\n1. Write a job strategy for generating test failure reports from logs\n2. Queue job groups that process the logs in batches\n\nThere's no existing strategy for this, so I need to create one. The strategy should instruct the worker to:\n- Read each log using `npm run read-log`\n- Identify test failures (look for test run results, failing tests, error messages)\n- Compile findings into a report\n\nWith 88 logs, I should batch them into manageable groups. Let me think about a good batch size - maybe 10-15 logs per group, which would be about 6-9 groups.\n\n\nI need to reconsider my approach since these are worker logs from the build system, and not all will contain test runs. The strategy should scan through batches of logs to identify which ones have test failures, then compile those into a report. I'll organize them into groups of about 10 logs each and add them to the end of the queue using the `--trailing` flag so they don't disrupt the existing jobs. I'm thinking through the batching strategy - instead of one job per log, I'll have each job process a batch of around 15 logs and append findings to a shared report file, then queue a final compilation job to summarize everything.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11180,"cache_read_input_tokens":34477,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11180,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"fc5abb55-616d-44c9-92c3-4467d05a74de","uuid":"c2cd33d4-6be3-4c8d-98e5-45efc393f5ac"}
