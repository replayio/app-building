Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"32b9be69-9a81-4d20-a586-01e157482ebd","uuid":"63a0282b-8617-4f38-b30b-502410960b49","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

DealsListPage, DealDetailPage, TasksListPage\n- **Routes are set up** in `App.tsx` but all point to a generic `PlaceholderPage` component\n- **Redux store** is initialized but has zero slices/reducers\n- **No components** have been built yet (no `src/components/` or `src/pages/` directories)\n- **No netlify functions** exist yet (no `netlify/` directory)\n- **Database schema** is fully defined in `scripts/schema.ts` with 13 tables: clients, tags, client_tags, individuals, client_individuals, relationships, contact_history, deals, deal_stage_history, deal_writeups, deal_contacts, tasks, attachments, timeline_events\n- **Design tokens** are fully configured in `index.css` using Tailwind v4 `@theme` with Linear-inspired styling\n- **Test spec** has detailed component-level tests written for ClientsListPage; other pages have component lists but test entries are marked as \"will be added by PlanComponent jobs\"\n- **Tech stack**: React 19, Redux Toolkit, React Router v7, Tailwind CSS v4, Vite v7, Neon (Postgres), Netlify Functions, lucide-react for icons, class-variance-authority + clsx + tailwind-merge for styling utilities\n- **Path alias**: `@/` maps to `./src/`\n- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a95b13e2b0e06dd81 (for resuming to continue this agent's work

ClientsListPage (/clients)\n   Description: A page listing all clients (organizations and individuals) in a tabular or card-based layout. Each row/card shows key summary fields: client name, type (org or individual), current status (active / inactive / prospect / churned), tags, primary contact, and possibly count of open deals and next task. Includes search, filtering (by status, tags, source, etc.), and sorting controls. Each client entry has an action to open the detailed Client page. There may be buttons to add a new client and import/export client data. Pagination or infinite scrolling is present for large client lists.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdGYR2WqlmNZbhk6aHrIt10MDU8Rq9OgLJAvCf\n\n2. ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n   Description: A detailed view for a single client (organization or individual). Multi section layout.\n\nTop section: summary header with client name, type (org or individual), current status (active / inactive / prospect / churned), tags, can be clicked to edit.  quick actions (add task, add deal, add attachment, add person).\n\nSource Info section: displays structured fields about how/where the client was acquired (e.g., referral, campaign, channel). Includes view/edit capability.\n\nTasks section: shows a list of unresolved tasks associated with the client. Each task may be optionally associated with a deal. Tasks can be clicked to open task detail page.\n\nDeals section: shows any current deal for the client with its name, stage, and $ value.  Can be clicked to go to the deal's detail page.\n\nAttachments section: lists files and links related to the client. Each attachment may optionally be associated with a deal. Displays filename, type, created date, and linked deal (if any), with download/view and delete options.\n\nPeople section: lists individuals associated with this client (e.g., contacts within an organization or related people around an individual client). Each entry shows the person's name, role/title, and can be clicked to go to the person's detail page.\n\nTimeline section (optional but implied by histories): consolidated chronological feed of tasks, contact events, status changes, deal stage changes, and notes/writeups related to the client.  Each can be clicked to go to its detail page.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdZvw32ApGkvBCJKoN0sMR1hwGF45DX7bVjHdu\n\n3. PersonDetailPage (/individuals/:individualId)\n   Description: A detailed page for a specific individual who is associated with one or more clients. May be reached from a client or from a global people listing (if present). Layout includes:\n\nHeader: individual's name, role/title, primary contact information, and association(s) to clients.\n\nRelationships with Other Individuals: a section or tab showing this individual's relationships graph/list to other individuals (e.g., colleague, decision maker, influencer). Each relationship item shows the related person's name, relationship type, and a link to that person's detail.\n\nHistory of Contact: a chronological log of interactions with this individual (emails, calls, meetings, notes). Each entry shows date/time, type of interaction, summary/notes, and possibly who on the team performed it. Includes ability to add/edit contact history entries.\n\nAssociated Clients section: list of clients this individual is associated with, with links back to the relevant Client Detail pages.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd6tTJNxrn27SvXDfJANF0dzKcZECW1mhuabTM\n\n4. DealsListPage (/deals)\n   Description: A page listing deals across all clients. The layout can be table-based or pipeline/board view by deal stage. Shows each deal's name, associated client, current stage, owner, and key metrics. Provides filtering (by stage, client, status), sorting, and search. Includes button to create a new deal. Integrates deal stage summary counts and possibly totals by stage.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdPKtynSfjDSRHCyvJs4Ih5EgFTpY2aun16btK\n\n5. DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)\n   Description: A detailed view for a specific deal. The layout includes:\n\nHeader: deal name, associated client, value (if used), owner, and current stage with controls to change stage.\n\nDeal Stage / History section: visual indicator of the current stage in the pipeline plus a chronological history of stage changes (old stage, new stage, date/time, user). May also show probability and expected close date.\n\nWriteups section: free-form or structured notes describing the deal context, needs, strategy, and updates.

DealsListPage, DealDetailPage, TasksListPage\n- **Routes are set up** in `App.tsx` but all point to a generic `PlaceholderPage` component\n- **Redux store** is initialized but has zero slices/reducers\n- **No components** have been built yet (no `src/components/` or `src/pages/` directories)\n- **No netlify functions** exist yet (no `netlify/` directory)\n- **Database schema** is fully defined in `scripts/schema.ts` with 13 tables: clients, tags, client_tags, individuals, client_individuals, relationships, contact_history, deals, deal_stage_history, deal_writeups, deal_contacts, tasks, attachments, timeline_events\n- **Design tokens** are fully configured in `index.css` using Tailwind v4 `@theme` with Linear-inspired styling\n- **Test spec** has detailed component-level tests written for ClientsListPage; other pages have component lists but test entries are marked as \"will be added by PlanComponent jobs\"\n- **Tech stack**: React 19, Redux Toolkit, React Router v7, Tailwind CSS v4, Vite v7, Neon (Postgres), Netlify Functions, lucide-react for icons, class-variance-authority + clsx + tailwind-merge for styling utilities\n- **Path alias**: `@/` maps to `./src/`\n- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`"}],"totalDurationMs":236388,"totalTokens":54719,"totalToolUseCount":28,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2129,"cache_read_input_tokens":38960,"output_tokens":13629,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2129},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me try to read it directly or use an alternative approach. But actually, I have enough context from the test spec and app spec to build the components. Let me proceed with writing the code.\n\nLet me plan the approach:\n\n1. **Sidebar** - Navigation sidebar with logo, nav links (Dashboard, Clients, Deals, Tasks, Reports, Settings), user profile dropdown at bottom\n2. **ClientsSearchAndFilters** - Search bar, Status/Tags/Source/Sort dropdowns\n3. **ClientsActions** - Import, Export, Add New Client buttons  \n\n\n4. **ClientsTable** - CSS Grid based table with columns: Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, Open Deals, Next Task, actions menu\n5. **Pagination** - Showing X-Y of Z clients, Previous, page numbers, Next\n6. **ClientsListPage** - Composes all above components\n\nNow I'm mapping out the full architecture: I'll need a Netlify function to handle the client data API, a Redux slice to manage the clients state, and the corresponding CSS styling for all these components.\n\nThe backend function will handle search, filtering, sorting, and pagination, while the Redux slice manages the client list, loading states, and filter/pagination settings. I should start with the backend and state management before building out the individual components, but looking at the job list, it seems the tasks are focused on the component implementations themselves. will read from the store. For the Sidebar, it's pretty straightforward—just navigation links. Now I need to map out the complete data flow: what the backend returns, the Redux state shape, and what each component receives as props. I'll build the backend first, then the Redux slice, then work through the components and finally the page.\n\nDefining the API shape for the clients endpoint with filtering and pagination support...\n\nNow I'm laying out the Redux state structure to manage the clients list, filters, and metadata. I'll start implementing the backend function and Redux slice first, then build out each component.\n\nI'm writing the Netlify function to fetch clients with all their related data—tags, primary contacts, open deals, and upcoming tasks. The tricky part is handling dynamic WHERE clauses with the neon serverless driver, so I'll need to build composable query fragments that conditionally include filters for search, status, tags, and sources. the filter values as parameters, so that should work. For the search functionality, I need to handle the ILIKE pattern with wildcards—if there's a search term, I'll wrap it with percent signs, otherwise use a catch-all pattern. The tags filter is trickier since it requires joining related tables, so I'm weighing whether to build one complex query with JOINs and GROUP BY or split it into separate queries for clients and their related data. A single query with proper aggregation seems cleaner.\n\nWriting the query... Building the query to fetch next task...\n\nThe WHERE clause needs to handle multiple optional filters for status, search patterns across clients and their tags/individuals, tag filtering, and source filtering. For sorting, I'm considering how to dynamically apply different ORDER BY clauses based on the sort parameter—whether that's by update time, name ascending, or name descending—and I need to figure out how to safely inject those with tagged templates.\n\nI'm leaning toward using CASE statements to handle the dynamic ordering rather than creating separate queries. I also need to account for the count query to get the total number of matched clients for pagination.\n\nNow I'm mapping out all the files I need to create for this feature: the backend API endpoint, Redux slice for state management, sidebar and search components with their styles, action buttons for import/export, the clients table, pagination controls, and the main page that ties everything together.\n\nI also need to set up the modals for importing data, adding new clients, editing existing ones, and confirming deletions. The tests reference these extensively, so I'll make sure they're properly integrated—the action buttons will trigger the import and add modals, while the table rows will have menu options for edit and delete actions.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the form fields each modal needs. The import dialog should show CSV format instructions and a file upload area with a data preview before confirming. The add and edit dialogs both need client name, type, status, tags, and source fields, with the edit version pre-populating existing data. The delete modal just needs a simple confirmation message.\n\nI also need to create the backend endpoints to support these operations—POST for creating clients, PUT for updates, DELETE for removal, and a separate POST endpoint for CSV imports. Since Netlify Functions route based on file names, I can handle the standard CRUD operations in a single `clients.ts` function using method routing, while the import logic can go in its own function.\n\nFor the routing structure, the clients function will handle requests at `/.netlify/functions/clients` for list and create operations, and `/.netlify/functions/clients/<clientId>` for operations on specific clients. I should also add a query parameter option like `?format=csv` to support exporting data, and include available tags and sources in the list response so the filter dropdowns have their options.\n\nWriting the function handlers now... Writing the Sidebar component... Building the sidebar component... I'm deciding on the styling approach for this project. The strategy recommends CSS files with style variables over hardcoded styles, and since Tailwind v4 is available with `@theme` support, I'll use Tailwind utilities for most components and reserve CSS files for complex styling that's difficult to express with utilities alone.\n\nNow I'm planning the backend structure for the Netlify Function that handles clients. I need to support GET requests with filtering, search, sort, and pagination, POST for creating clients, PUT for updates, DELETE for removal, and CSV import/export functionality. Looking at the test spec, the import dialog expects CSV format instructions and file upload handling.\n\nI also need to ensure all interactive elements have the proper test IDs from the spec—things like sidebar components, filter controls, action buttons, and table rows.\n\nNow I'm planning my implementation strategy: I'll start with the backend function as the source of truth, then build out the Redux slice to manage state, and finally create each component in sequence. Before I dive into writing the backend code, I should check what version of Netlify functions this project is using to make sure I'm following the right format. just use the standard Request/Response format that Netlify Functions v2 supports, since netlify-cli should handle it without needing the @netlify/functions package installed. Still writing the handler function...\n\nI'm realizing the TypeScript configuration might not cover the netlify functions directory since it's outside src/, and I notice the eslint config explicitly ignores that folder, so I may need to handle the setup differently. I need to set up the Neon driver using tagged template literals for all queries, making sure the netlify functions read from the environment variable while keeping initSchema separate from that concern. Let me write out the implementation now, being careful to follow the pattern of building composable query fragments for dynamic WHERE clauses.\n\nFor dynamic filtering, I can use conditional values in the template literal—passing empty strings or null values and using OR conditions so the database only applies filters when they're actually provided. For sorting, I'll use a CASE expression to handle different sort options dynamically within the query itself.\n\nStill writing query logic... I'm realizing the multiple CASE expressions will all evaluate, so when sort is 'name_asc', the first CASE returns the name while the others return NULL, making the name column the primary sort with updated_at as a tiebreaker. When sort is anything else like 'recently_updated', the first two CASE expressions return NULL and updated_at becomes the effective sort. This approach should work correctly.\n\nNow I'm going to write out all the necessary files methodically, starting with the backend function, then the Redux slice, store configuration, and finally all the UI components.\n\nFor the backend, I need to handle the full set of CRUD operations—fetching clients with filters, search, sorting, and pagination, plus creating, updating, and deleting clients with tag support, and managing CSV import/export functionality. The Netlify function will route all these operations through a single endpoint, parsing the request path to determine which action to perform.\n\nWriting the backend function... I'm debating how to handle the import endpoint—whether to use a query parameter like `?bulk=true`, a separate path like `/import`, or just detect the payload structure. The simplest approach is to check if the request body contains an array of clients versus a single client object, so the same POST endpoint handles both single and bulk creates.\n\nFor the export feature, I'll add a GET endpoint that accepts a `format=csv` parameter along with the existing filter parameters. Now I need to figure out how to populate the tag and source filter dropdowns—those values probably need to come from the backend.\n\nLet me start writing the backend function, but first I should clarify the TypeScript setup for Netlify functions. The project uses ES modules and the tsconfig only covers the src directory, so I need to make sure the netlify-cli can properly compile TypeScript functions in the netlify folder.\n\nI could import the types from @netlify/functions, but since that package isn't installed, I'll just define the handler function with inline types instead—the netlify-cli should infer the format correctly without needing the explicit type imports.\n\nSince the tsconfig only checks files in \"src/\" and the eslint config ignores netlify functions anyway, I don't need strict type annotations here. I'll write a simple, clean function that works with the neon driver...\n\nSetting up the neon import...\n\nNow I'm planning out the full implementation: a netlify function to handle clients with GET for listing and exporting, POST for creating or bulk importing, and PUT/DELETE for updates and deletions. Then I'll build the Redux slice to manage the client state with the proper shape including id, name, type, and status fields.\n\nDefining the Redux state structure...\n\nNow I'm thinking through the thunks I need—fetching clients with filters, creating and updating records, deleting clients, and handling bulk import/export operations.\n\nFor the UI, I need to build custom dropdown components since I can't use native select elements. I'm planning a reusable CustomSelect component that I can apply across all the filter controls, starting with the label, value, options, and onChange handler.\n\nLooking at the table structure from the test spec, each row needs to display the client name as a clickable link, their type and status with color-coded badges, tags as chips, primary contact info, open deals with values, next task details, and an action menu. I've already got the status color variables set up in the CSS, so I can reference those directly.\n\nLet me just start writing the code now.\n\nI need to keep in mind the layout strategy: the page component will handle all the padding, but individual components shouldn't have outer margins or padding on their root elements. I'll also make sure to add all the necessary data-testid attributes throughout based on what the tests expect.\n\nWriting the backend function... I'm setting up the HTTP handler to manage CORS preflight requests, then parsing the request path to extract the client ID and query parameters. For GET requests, I'm checking if a specific client ID was provided—if so, I'm fetching that individual client's details along with their associated tags from the database.\n\nIf no client ID is specified, I'm checking whether the request is asking for a CSV export or just listing all clients with any applied filters. For POST requests, I'm routing to either an import handler or a standard create handler depending on the action parameter. For PUT requests, I'm validating that a client ID exists before proceeding with the update.\n\nNow I'm realizing the `sql` object from neon is a tagged template function, which makes it tricky to pass around as a parameter to other handler functions. But actually, `neon()` returns a callable function that I can pass through without issues. I'll keep my current structure and just make sure to pass the sql instance to each handler function that needs it. I should think through the typing here to make sure everything lines up correctly.\n\nFor the list query, I need to handle search functionality across client names, tags, and contact information, plus filter by status.\n\nBuilding the SQL query... Writing the WHERE clause...\n\nI also need to add a COUNT query to get the total number of results for pagination, and then fetch the distinct tags and sources so the filter dropdowns have the right options available.\n\nNow I'm working through the ORDER BY logic with the neon template to make sure it handles the sorting correctly—when a sort parameter matches, that CASE expression returns the column name, otherwise it returns NULL, which lets the tiebreaker column take over. I'm confident PostgreSQL will handle the parameterized CASE expressions fine since it evaluates them as constants within the query. Now I need to write out all the code files, but doing them sequentially would be inefficient. I can parallelize the backend function, Redux slice, and Sidebar component since they're independent of each other, then tackle the remaining components that depend on the Redux interface I'll establish.\n\nWriting the backend function and components... Writing the query logic... Finishing up the CSV formatting with the next task details, then returning the response with proper headers. After that, I'm querying for the full client list and fetching the distinct tags and sources to populate the filters.\n\nNow I'm returning the paginated client data along with the available filter options, and handling the POST request for bulk imports where I iterate through the provided clients and insert them into the database. Now I'm handling the single client creation path, validating that a name was provided, then inserting the new client and associating any tags by looking up their IDs and creating the relationship records.\n\nFor the PUT endpoint, I'm updating the client record with any provided fields while preserving existing values, and then handling tag updates if they were included in the request. Handling the DELETE request to remove a client, then catching any errors and returning appropriate responses. Now I'm setting up a query function that handles pagination and filtering by search terms, status, tags, and source.\n\nBuilding the database query... Building the query results... Finishing the sort logic and pagination, then returning the results. I'm realizing there's a potential issue with the open_deals subquery—when there are no deals, the COUNT still returns 0 and json_build_object gets called, which is actually the correct behavior since correlated subqueries with aggregates always return a row. Now I'm thinking through the import flow logic.\n\nFor the import process, I need to fix how I'm finding the inserted client—using just the name is fragile since multiple clients could share the same name. I'll use a RETURNING clause to get the ID directly from the INSERT statement, then use that ID for associating tags. I'm also deciding to keep the sql type as `any` for simplicity since we're outside the tsconfig scope, though I'll maintain proper typing where it makes sense.\n\nNow I'm planning out the structure of all the files I need to write and thinking through what each component should look like. Sidebar.tsx\n- Fixed left sidebar, 244px wide\n- Logo at top\n- Nav links with icons\n- User profile dropdown at bottom\n- Uses useLocation for active state\n\n### ClientsSearchAndFilters.tsx\n- Search input\n- Four custom dropdowns: Status, Tags, Source, Sort\n- Dispatches Redux actions when filters change\n- Reads available tags/sources from Redux state\n\n### ClientsActions.tsx\n- Import button\n- Export button\n- Add New Client button\n- Import modal, Add New Client modal\n\n### ClientsTable.tsx\n- CSS Grid based table\n- Renders client rows with all columns\n- Row action menu with View Details, Edit, Delete\n- Edit modal, Delete confirmation modal\n- Empty state when no clients\n\n### Pagination.tsx\n- Shows \"Showing X-Y of Z clients\"\n- Previous/Next buttons\n- Page number buttons\n- Dispatches page change actions\n\n### ClientsListPage.tsx\n- Composes all components together\n- Fetches clients on mount and when filters change\n- Layout combines sidebar with main content area\n\nNow I'm thinking through the form structure for adding and editing clients. I need a reusable form component that handles client name, type selection, status, tags, and source. I'll create a shared form pattern that both the add and edit modals can use, keeping the logic centralized.\n\nFor the import modal, I need to handle CSV uploads with format instructions, a file preview, and confirmation. The delete confirmation is straightforward—just a modal asking for confirmation before removing a client.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the test IDs I'll need across the sidebar, search, and filter components to match the test specifications. I'm finishing up the test IDs for pagination controls, then I'll start writing out all the component files in one go—beginning with the backend function and working through the Redux slice, store configuration, and then all the React components. I'm organizing the work into distinct jobs and need to set up the infrastructure first—the backend function, Redux slice, and store configuration—before building each component. For the custom dropdown across the filters, I'm creating a reusable component that manages its own state with React instead of relying on native select elements.\n\nBuilding the custom dropdown... Writing the dropdown component...\n\nNow I'm mapping out the complete data flow—when the page loads, it fetches clients with initial filters, and whenever a filter changes, it triggers a new fetch with the updated parameters. Let me make sure the Redux state updates properly and the components respond to those changes.\n\nI'm deciding between keeping all filters in Redux versus managing them locally, and I think storing them in Redux makes more sense since filters should persist across navigation and a single useEffect can watch for any changes to trigger a refetch. The Redux slice will hold the client data along with pagination info and a filters object containing search, status, tag, source, and sort fields.\n\nDefining the Redux slice structure... sort, page]), so the thunk reads all current filter values from state and constructs the API request with those parameters. This keeps the logic centralized and clean.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the pagination reset—when any filter changes, the page should go back to 1, which I can handle directly in each reducer action by resetting the page field. I've got a solid implementation plan, so let me start writing the actual code. I also need to add a multi-tag input component to the form where users can enter comma-separated tags or press Enter to add them as removable chips, styled consistently with the rest of the interface.\n\nNow I'm mapping out all the files I need to create and modify...\n\nI count 12 total—the Netlify function, Redux slice, UI components with styling, pages, and updates to the store and main app. For styling, I'll use Tailwind where possible but create a dedicated CSS file for the sidebar to handle those custom variables, and I might need some custom CSS for the table's grid layout since the style guide emphasizes CSS Grid.\n\nActually, I can handle the table grid directly with Tailwind's arbitrary value syntax using inline styles for the column template, which keeps everything in one place without extra CSS files.\n\nLet me verify the implementation order one more time: backend endpoint first, then Redux slice, then components, modals, and finally the page. I've already mapped out the data flow and component hierarchy, so I'm ready to start writing.\n\nSetting up the Redux thunk to fetch clients with proper URL construction for the Netlify dev environment... Writing async thunks...\n\nNow I'm thinking about the loading state strategy—I should avoid showing loading indicators during refetches when data already exists, only displaying them on initial loads when the items array is empty to prevent unnecessary UI flashing.\n\nFor the async operations, I need to make sure create, update, and delete return promises so the UI can await them before closing edit mode.\n\nLet me draft out all the files completely before writing them out.\n\nFirst, the backend function needs full CRUD operations with filtering and import capabilities. Then the Redux slice with state management for items, pagination, filters, and all the thunks to handle those operations. I'll add the reducer to the store, build out the sidebar with navigation and user profile, style it properly, and then move on to the main client list components.\n\nNow I'm building the search and filter interface with a search bar and dropdown controls. Then the action buttons for importing, exporting, and creating new clients—the import flow will include a modal for CSV upload and preview. I'll create a reusable form modal for both creating and editing clients, followed by the main table component using CSS Grid to display all client data with inline actions and modals for editing or deleting. Pagination controls will handle navigation between pages, and finally I'll compose everything together on the clients list page with the sidebar and main content area.\n\nI'm estimating around 1450 lines total across all these files, starting with the backend clients API and Redux slice, then moving through the UI components.\n\nNow I need to think through the data fetching strategy—specifically, the page should refetch whenever filters or pagination changes, but I want to avoid hammering the API with requests when someone's typing in the search field. I'll implement debouncing on the search input to handle that.\n\nFor the search component, I'll maintain a local state that updates immediately as the user types, then after a 300ms delay, dispatch the actual Redux action to update the global search filter and trigger a refetch. The other filter dropdowns can dispatch immediately since users won't be changing those as rapidly.\n\nNow I'm deciding on the icon set from lucide-react for the sidebar and other UI elements. I need to handle the file upload for the import modal—the test expects a dialog that accepts CSV files. I'll create a hidden file input with a styled drop zone, then build out the import flow where users can select or drag a CSV file, preview the parsed data, and confirm the import before the backend processes it. Since there's no CSV library available, I'll write a simple parser myself.\n\nNow let me start building the code.\n\nI should also think through the export functionality—when users click Export, it should download a CSV file with all the currently filtered clients and their relevant columns like name, type, status, tags, and contact info. I'll handle this as a frontend fetch to the backend with a format parameter, then trigger the download in the Redux thunk.\n\nWriting the export thunk...\n\nActually, I'm reconsidering this approach—since exporting doesn't modify any state, it makes more sense to handle it as a simple async function directly in the component rather than creating a Redux thunk. I'll move the export logic into the ClientsActions component and trigger the download from there.\n\nBuilding the export handler... Writing CSV parser...\n\nFor the import preview, I'll display the first 5 rows in a table, and I need to validate that the required columns—Client Name, Type, and Status—are present, while Tags, Source, and Primary Contact are optional.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering the icon choices for the buttons. The spec says import should have a download icon and export should have an upload icon, which initially seems backwards, but I think it's about the visual direction of the arrows rather than the conceptual flow—a download icon points downward into the system, while an upload icon points upward out of it.\n\nI'll use the Download icon from lucide-react for import and the Upload icon for export, then start writing the code with careful attention to imports, type annotations, test IDs, design tokens, and making sure the components stay layout-agnostic.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the Redux slice and how filter changes trigger page resets and refetches. The page component needs to watch the filter values, but since filters is an object reference that changes on each render, I need to destructure the individual filter properties and use those as dependencies instead. Still writing selector logic... I'm setting up individual selectors for each filter value and the page number, then using them all as dependencies in the useEffect that fetches clients. Now I need to think through the layout structure—the Sidebar should be part of the ClientsListPage component itself since it's always visible, even though in a production app it would live in a shared layout wrapper. For individual clients where the primary contact is themselves, I need to display \"(Self)\" next to their name. I'm handling this in the table display logic by checking if the client type is \"Individual\" and the primary contact name matches the client name, then formatting it accordingly.\n\nNow I need to handle the \"Next Task\" column formatting. I'm creating a utility function that converts task due dates into human-readable relative formats like \"Today, 2pm\" or \"Tomorrow, 10am\" by comparing the task date against today and

In ClientsSearchAndFilters.tsx, the `useEffect` that syncs `localSearch` with `filters.search` triggers a lint error about calling setState in an effect. I need to restructure this.\n2. In ClientsTable.tsx, the `Plus` import is unused.\n\nFor issue 1, I can use a different approach. Instead of syncing the local state with the Redux state via an effect, I can derive the displayed value differently. The issue is: when filters.search changes from outside (e.g., clearing all filters), the local search state should update. \n\nOne approach: use a ref to track the last dispatched search value, and compare it with the current filters.search to determine if we need to reset local state.\n\n\nActually, I'm overcomplicating this. The cleanest solution is to use the Redux state directly as the input value and manage debouncing with a ref, eliminating the need for a separate local state that syncs back to Redux. I'm realizing that calling setState during render creates unnecessary re-renders, so let me reconsider the approach—maybe I should just use a ref to track the previous Redux value and only update local state when it actually changes, avoiding the effect dependency cycle altogether.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":492,"cache_read_input_tokens":105700,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":492,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":12,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"32
