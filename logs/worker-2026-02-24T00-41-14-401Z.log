The assignee field shows a placeholder such as \"Unassigned\" or \"—\". The layout does not break or collapse; the fields still occupy their expected positions.\n\n#### Description text displayed\n- **Initial state:** TaskDetailPage is loaded for a task with description \"Discuss renewal terms and finalize pricing for next quarter\".\n- **Expected:** The info section displays the full description text \"Discuss renewal terms and finalize pricing for next quarter\" in a readable format below or alongside the metadata fields.\n\n#### Empty description shows appropriate placeholder\n- **Initial state:** TaskDetailPage is loaded for a task with no description.\n- **Expected:** The description area shows a placeholder such as \"No description\" or is gracefully omitted. The layout does not break.\n\n### TaskNotesSection\n\n#### Notes section displays existing notes in chronological order\n- **Initial state:** TaskDetailPage is loaded for a task that has three existing notes.\n- **Expected:** The notes section displays a heading (e.g., \"Notes\"). All three notes are listed in chronological order (oldest first or newest first). Each note displays the note content text, the author name (or \"System\" if no author), and a formatted timestamp showing when the note was created.\n\n#### Add note form with text input and submit button\n- **Initial state:** TaskDetailPage is loaded for any task.\n- **Expected:** The notes section includes an input area (text input or textarea) for writing a new note and a submit button (e.g., \"Add Note\" or a send icon). The input has placeholder text (e.g., \"Add a note...\").\n\n#### Submitting a note adds it to the list\n- **Initial state:** TaskDetailPage is loaded. The add note input is empty.\n- **Action:** User types \"Called client to discuss timeline\" into the note input and clicks the submit button.\n- **Expected:** The note is created via the POST API endpoint. The new note appears in the notes list with the content \"Called client to discuss timeline\", the current user as author (or \"System\" if unauthenticated), and the current timestamp. The input field is cleared after successful submission.\n\n#### Submit button disabled when note input is empty\n- **Initial state:** TaskDetailPage is loaded. The add note input is empty.\n- **Expected:** The submit button is disabled or visually indicates it cannot be clicked when the note input is empty. Clicking it does nothing.\n\n#### Delete button removes a note\n- **Initial state:** TaskDetailPage is loaded for a task with existing notes. Each note has a delete button (trash icon or \"Delete\" text).\n- **Action:** User clicks the delete button on a specific note.\n- **Expected:** The note is deleted via the DELETE API endpoint. The note is removed from the notes list. The remaining notes are still displayed in their original order. The total count of notes decreases by one.\n\n#### Empty state when no notes exist\n- **Initial state:** TaskDetailPage is loaded for a task with no notes.\n- **Expected:** The notes section displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No notes yet\" or \"Add a note to get started\"). The add note form is still visible and functional.\n\n### EditTaskModal\n\n#### Edit button opens modal with current task data pre-populated\n- **Initial state:** TaskDetailPage is loaded for a task titled \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\" with priority \"High\", due date of Oct 25 at 3:00 PM, client \"Acme Corp\", and assignee \"Sarah Johnson\".\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Edit\" button.\n- **Expected:** The EditTaskModal opens. The Title field contains \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\". The Priority dropdown shows \"High\". The Due Date picker shows Oct 25 at 3:00 PM. The Client dropdown shows \"Acme Corp\". The Assignee dropdown shows \"Sarah Johnson\". The Description textarea contains any existing description text.\n\n#### EditTaskModal form fields\n- **Initial state:** EditTaskModal is open.\n- **Expected:** The modal contains a form with fields: Title (text input, required), Description (textarea), Due Date (date/time picker), Priority (dropdown with High, Medium, Normal, Low), Client (searchable FilterSelect dropdown populated from clients API), Assignee (searchable FilterSelect dropdown populated from users API).

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    97→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n    98→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n    99→\n   100→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   101→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   102→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   103→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   104→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   105→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   106→\n   107→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   108→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   109→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   110→  tokens are generated and stored.

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\").

Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01KWdUcNjC1bWTDE8F3TH8mN","session_id":"b6001626-cb14-4d93-9970-4fb084f5121e","uuid":"ec631659-8a92-477c-bbd8-8f3a260fdb8e"}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes.

It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match.

Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b6001626-cb14-4d93-9970-4fb084f5121e","uuid":"e269c3d8-9e4f-4a3d-b43a-5e44ec38d21a","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

[2026-02-24T00:40:41.615Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_015wGjsHqCVVqM3Xng1nQajX","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear picture. Let me work through each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecContactsList - Check testSpec.md directive violations in ContactsListPage test entries\n\nThe ContactsListPage section in docs/tests.md (lines 443-444) is completely empty:\n```\n## ContactsListPage (/contacts)\n```\n\nAccording to AppRevisions.md, the ContactsListPage has significant functionality:\n- Searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns\n- Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input\n- Pagination (50 per page)\n\n\n- CSV import/export capabilities\n- Modal form for adding new contacts\n- Row clicks that navigate to PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id\n- Backend individuals list endpoint returning enriched data with associated client names\n\nThe testSpec.md directives require me to systematically document every visible element—columns, filters, buttons, icons—with specific test entries for each, ensuring clickable elements specify their exact navigation targets or action results, and that any data-mutating actions are properly captured.\n\nI've found a critical gap: the ContactsListPage section in docs/tests.md is completely empty despite the substantial functionality outlined in AppRevisions.md. The ContactsListPage component itself is currently just a stub, so I need to check what writeApp.md violations exist here and ensure the component implementation matches the test requirements. The ContactsListPage needs a complete implementation with a table, search functionality, filters, pagination, and CSV import/export capabilities based on the spec, plus a modal for adding new contacts. Since there are no tests either, I need to implement the full component following the build pipeline, then create the corresponding Playwright tests to cover all the functionality. I see that these violations all stem from ContactsListPage not being implemented yet, so rather than treating them as separate fixes, I should use the proper build pipeline strategies—starting with the test spec strategy, then moving to component implementation, and finally tests. Let me structure the fix groups accordingly, grouping related tasks by their shared root cause but following the natural workflow for building out this page. I'm realizing the checkDirectives strategy is meant for maintenance, but what I actually need here is a full build pipeline since the page doesn't exist yet. I should create fix groups using the build strategies—testSpec.md for the test specification, writeApp.md for the components, and writeTests.md for the actual tests—rather than trying to force the checkDirectives pattern. strategies makes more sense for a full page build. The testSpec strategy knows how to write test specs. The writeApp strategy knows how to write components. The writeTests strategy knows how to write tests. The checkDirectives strategy is for checking, not building from scratch.\n\nBut then again, the fix jobs added by checkDirectives would be processed by the checkDirectives strategy, which has a \"Fixing violations\" section. Let me use the checkDirectives strategy since that's what the example shows, and the \"Fixing violations\" section says to update docs/tests.md, app code, and playwright tests.\n\nActually, the scope of work here is substantial - a full page build. Using the appropriate build strategies would give better guidance. But the convention in the example is to use the checkDirectives strategy.\n\nI'm going to use the build strategies for the fix groups since the work really does match those strategies perfectly - writing test specs, building components, and creating tests. The checkDirectives strategy doesn't provide the detailed guidance needed for a full page implementation, and the important thing is getting the work done correctly. I'm realizing that all three violations stem from the same root cause—ContactsListPage is unimplemented—but the fixes require distinct work phases that should be handled separately. Using the appropriate build strategies for each phase makes more sense than forcing them into a single checkDirectives job, since the worker will understand exactly what to do when they see the strategy paired with a clear job description.\n\nI'll structure this as three separate groups following the patterns from each strategy: a testSpec group to plan the page and add test entries, a writeApp group to build the components and page itself, and a writeTests group to write the test suite. I need to add these groups in reverse order so they execute sequentially—if I add writeTests first, then writeApp, then testSpec, the testSpec will end up at the front of the queue and run first, followed by the others in the correct order. I'm realizing the testSpec group needs to run first since it determines what components and test entries exist, which the later groups depend on. So I should add all three groups to the queue now—testSpec first, then writeApp and writeTests—and let the workers handle the dependencies as they execute. I need to add three groups in sequence: first a testSpec group to plan the ContactsListPage, then a writeApp group to write the page itself, and finally a writeTests group for the test files. The writeApp and writeTests groups can use general job descriptions since the workers will consult the docs to determine the exact components and test entries needed. I'll organize this into three sequential groups following the build pipeline: first planning the test entries with testSpec strategy, then implementing the components with writeApp strategy, and finally writing the tests with writeTests strategy. Each group has clear guidance in the docs for what needs to be done.\n\nFor the writeApp and writeTests groups, I'll use generic job names that allow them to unpack into component-specific sub-groups as needed. Let me set up the commands to add these groups with the appropriate strategies and job descriptions. Deciding on ContactsListPage components, add sections to docs/tests.md. I need to add planning jobs for each build phase—testSpec, writeApp, and writeTests—that will trigger the workers to unpack them further using their Unpack Sub-Groups sections. This creates the cleanest flow where each planning job generates the appropriate sub-groups for components, write operations, and tests. I'll add them in reverse order to the front of the queue. App group → goes to front (before writeTests)\n3. Then add testSpec group → goes to front (before writeApp)\n\nResult: testSpec → writeApp → writeTests (correct build order)\n\nActually, wait. There might be other groups already in the queue. Let me check what's in the queue by looking at jobs.json... but the strategy says \"The agent NEVER reads or writes jobs.json directly.\"\n\nLet me just add them. The order matters: testSpec must run before writeApp, which must run before writeTests.\n\nOK I will add them one at a time, in reverse order to the front. Let me write the commands.\n\nLooking at the testSpec strategy more carefully, I see the pattern for how sub-groups are unpacked. The PlanPage job produces test entries, and there's a special case where all the PlanPage and PlanComponent jobs are bundled together in one group so the worker processes them sequentially. I should follow this same structure.\n\nFor the testSpec group, I can infer from AppRevisions.md what components ContactsListPage needs. Following the pattern from TasksListPage which has FilterBar, Card, CreateModal, and ListContent, I'd expect ContactsListPage to have a ContactsFilterBar for search, ContactsTable for display, and a Create component.\n\nBut I shouldn't guess—the PlanPage job will figure this out. I'll just add a single planning job for the testSpec phase and let it determine the components and add the necessary sub-groups.\n\nActually, looking at the testSpec strategy more carefully, PlanPage and PlanComponent jobs should be in the same group since they're executed together in one iteration. For the initial build, PlanPages is its own group that adds PlanPage groups for each page, which then add PlanComponent sub-groups. Since I already know the page is ContactsListPage, I can add a group with both PlanPage and PlanComponent jobs—but I need to know the components first to add the PlanComponent jobs. So I'll just add a single PlanPage job and let the worker decide on components and add the PlanComponent sub-jobs following the testSpec strategy. I see the issue now—I need to know the components upfront to add them all in one group with the PlanPage job. Since I can infer the components from AppRevisions.md and similar page patterns, I'll identify them directly: ContactsFilterBar, ContactsTable, and CreateContactModal. This way I can add the complete group with all the necessary jobs in a single iteration. Adding test entries for ContactsListContent...\n\nI'm realizing this approach is getting unwieldy—the real concern is whether I've identified the component names correctly, and I won't know until I start building them out.\n\nLet me simplify: I'll have testSpec create a PlanPageContactsList job that reads the AppRevisions and decides what components are needed, writes those decisions to docs/tests.md, and spawns PlanComponent sub-groups as needed. Then writeApp and writeTests can each have their own planning jobs that read from docs/tests.md to determine what to build.\n\nRunning the commands...\n\nActually, I need to think about the order here. If I use --trailing for writeApp and writeTests, they'll end up at the very end of the queue after any other groups. Instead, I should add writeTests first, then writeApp, both to the front so they run in the right sequence after testSpec completes.\n\nLet me reconsider the approach though. Looking at the checkDirectives strategy example, it shows how to structure multiple related jobs together. I should follow that pattern and add the groups in the right order to ensure they execute sequentially: testSpec needs to run first, then writeApp, then writeTests. update anything else affected by the changes you are making, in docs/tests.md, the app code, and playwright tests.\"\n\nSo a fix job can update docs/tests.md, app code, and playwright tests. Let me use this approach with meaningful descriptions.\n\nBut for a completely unimplemented page, the work is substantial. Using the build strategies would give better guidance. Hmm.\n\nOK, I think the best approach is to use the build strategies since they have the detailed guidance needed for building a page from scratch. The checkDirectives strategy's \"Fixing violations\" section is too general for this scope of work.\n\nLet me just go ahead and add the groups in the right order: testSpec first, then writeApp, then

I'll add fix groups using the build strategies to properly build this page."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4498,"cache_read_input_tokens":45459,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4498,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b6001626-cb14-4d93-9970-4fb084f5121e","uuid":"99275f34-e0d5-482b-8505-e263fa5b9e2e"}
