No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs).

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch.

The ForgotPasswordPage test entries are:\n\n1. **Page displays heading and instructions** - No dedicated test\n2. **Email input field is displayed** - No dedicated test\n3. **Submit button is displayed with label** - No dedicated test\n4. **Submit with valid email shows success message** - No dedicated test\n5. **Submit with empty email shows validation error** - No dedicated test\n6. **Submit with invalid email format shows validation error** - No dedicated test\n7. **Back to sign in link is displayed and navigates correctly** - No dedicated test\n8. **Submit button shows loading state during request** - No dedicated test\n\n\n9. **Sidebar navigation only tests the route to the forgot-password page, not the page itself**\n\nNow I'm checking each testSpec.md directive against these test entries. The first directive about systematically inventorying every visible element is partially covered—the test entries mention the heading, instructions, email input, submit button, success message, validation errors, back link, and loading state, but there's no actual Playwright test file implementing these checks.\n\nFor clickable elements, the submit button specifies the success message and API call, and the back link mentions navigation back to the main app. The data mutation directive is satisfied since the forgot password flow involves sending an email. Button appearance is specified with the \"Send Reset Link\" text. There are no modals on this page, and the substitution directive seems fine. The last directive about images across different pages appears to be cut off, but I should continue checking the remaining directives to see if there are any other violations.\n\nNow I'm moving into the second subtask to check for writeApp.md directive violations in the forgot password page components.\n\nFirst, I'm verifying that all JSX is properly abstracted—the ForgotPasswordPage correctly delegates to a separate ForgotPasswordForm component. Then I'm scanning through the form to confirm all interactive elements have the required data-testid attributes: the form container, success message, back link, email input, error display, and submit button all have their identifiers in place. I need to verify whether the `auth-page` CSS class includes the required padding, and I'm checking through the remaining guidelines—most don't apply to this frontend component, though I should confirm the visual appearance matches the mockup once I have access to it. I need to clarify what I'm actually checking here — the Requirements section mentions comments in JSX, but I should be focusing on the Directives sections that are explicitly labeled in each skill file. Let me look at the specific Directives ranges: testSpec.md has them at lines 41-68, writeApp.md at lines 50-103, and writeTests.md at lines 26-127.\n\nNow let me examine the CSS for the auth-page.","signature":"EvczCkYICxgCKkBYhFhpwZa+r4oPQEBkeVUGMnfJXPLLfJBdYJV0oi2wKl6NUDw5kovko4LD21p8chfE0I6HbqDQKOGd4cjjbqz3EgwPdMGScy5dCNGdS1saDOLiGnbJjueDPQZKfCIwVq1PbbJRLPNJd59FJEjWTdB2i+LgBjnzHhKJOEnsQGzSYuMjuTe+WwL6qGMt2oSaKt4yI+qQGIZhuOldx4CvrifLanzQF07VNQJold4PxS2SjnLhV52V5wqdPKZ2hhjoDMZVEgndwQJ/KsaWQdTILfO7OQWmXwnZY6q313Uozo9LAn5NgiRw9PxEHXtogoH44cQKoebJIqjBeQhyBnK2VFa3Ci+3BTPVkitt7fe9iWHW56728tfRpa29yQKAU/D74+to22AOwXQIo6LyKI30IJtYHriWnhLY5T9Hqm68DKT8PQeLP5NgKic4jbR+JPcyg4Y6oTAOdwU665xoX7I/0dsw4UgkpMp4InYIozhqIakKmeVIOSA5t2A2vbk40HI+y1KFLeqODbTxHZkQopi+Crw9ptbZLNJWvkgdsfmT1tcxx8pFpQOdeaocQJvxvGqya83TqYON+VkluXlFl3045E3USZuWezxljtdJe7frJeUyJqu7DzoOwQU/O5NZJ/wAmYIpVJWJrT1ip+ZIGbdMAGbb5c4n8lSmMfL1HuXBRljb+toaS1PzJwNs9415rCQpzhFU+7xAcXnP4/SKPJYTUkvmc2L9T+yTmN/ySUH7oBsX7jSdEwqa7/PafUr8v43YYekYSVAYR64w+ik3zZHczz7/uEQV6quytXwd/7a2VWMvBYkKEPWEzUGyydVKgCOmS3ofTjBoUCQ7RInqacWMsFTeaYweGeF6SHb1Ufv2Yqaz3BVJ0I7YYkAcgD3NCSziImBbPVlgCkzVsKmKTTqiJYV1Re5lavI6RpZzV6nGFianjlz47Ra5s1Z6f3gSwaMnN1HnpNPRo4xOLoigahIe7aDVX/TOHrUD+wYShoNEn5uGgO8+tr4nF3bkOvAmAqH8uQ6PdOuOb6xkfPOjRRSiOao3C4H8U+xEmQJF67QXpHstzxS/w/y6lFa2WWpDLobXJ4MNtl2XGD8AJ8G71eqA3C92bpG7An+nkohMzp3u7HdqoEVdmdIaFBLz5mtad5mpmWYPBbqoRqIJoh/dwv/L0ImXbacYJqjJj0FxER4Uf945Dt2JVMuLtrshp+FtNpXzd+z5QxbS8iin4/dTGVHBrf9mrdZD71bXI+CezZIizGtEtbEdDiwzxqG/AV7VwnuJUn+eEgaQpJmT0vgqYHBCYx75GxO09dby/ACb/ePteWH2JrQUzAW2tx/naEgP1Im5sgPGJzoiNMza2mZMYYUZb9mQbcxutn4hLFO+hgQOMiUFZGkTLu+WTxQ/uiiUa/j1b2HI1n5cz5iqavOn4zLS6v8NZvbv9FnDc3fxc8IHDS9A1PY4QYBODe7n2I0wizGC2M9tNf8cBR+y20Op8tARki5dUNqqWQtmDIlDVVf+bTvgNhYxy/RwRwAmL5mTW1uaEibtq+DCPOf7OM4x6uhxT2laorBuwyujSxDGf3nFPovEbaezsnlxEmjvU44kbr/nVEyP0itpbcFLA7piYGJgU9CcLWGuQkjHe9cAsaTN1BZ9rbRo59HI7zYAEmYsy2C4opg3uLi37kne46k6cg2yjmixUbn/PGAxFvApdehvZHmy60PRqRnu3FHzw1EP+ColJ3PBHAhDWu76QIeDflZtv8PNaFxnE40w1SM+pw2UAB05Ptkp/CajBKGlgKYkHDxPeJmEdPeoWC1Mjvb0o9Cy2HDBbahAgsIgYfFCTPiduOszLeXKPg57HWQXH8MKqKhhMzrJsZx3WNA3QL4pUWDm4bI731T/Cc/Pp/oiTQU4uGGNd0NHPWVq/MV1IhDm6pHD1Kt+vva+evb0hJx8U1AtByPBPUhs9PnlzWxYEmskHHjfMAxQSSkBQZ2X/2HvuATVVAaf3H2yfPzHvwVQkW/hYZsoxj/tZ0bo0hY6PDyJHy/fzm/IzQ0lEXagCnBHEpfcceh6GdSufggP0ZksfNpe1FZpu6ctTdbNyOpsHZnxh5uDgHlv7/4tasn6eJYLStmdzOYvfOtKp79WyIH79vxcocnBUOcvg1OKvFzNRvANKGTEOs9V+JA+l03jDk+tL39i8dXUGLaY1L6REHUPEFrm0bNJBp28QLKkVMImkbGLFoNtqH7tiDd+3rvmgnNGCSfduFZyd/tb40Co98yIc7/mq8eMlgxFfrDwqc+zgOTzzvpdvRxjl7Q0jEyalV3rLCkGarBrhZZQRdLtdIxKTrngOVzVG0smYo/M0uYxdQSkl6HXQlGAsj6o3hjTQUrdbAzZXyyAxP+9q/7cgBRF/GO3kJJywu9hsaO3g/lihQE1Kgj4zPPyiOlmNU26G8HoDXrRYLQInrDL+4crsM9VLuBTVEm9nW8DOhT4p1lY6IjIZ6ZbyOb3A244ZfLsGHp+GDKGuLAAbl7wuJf4jhec05KujcABjASbsjGSU0qzkpQHzEJZjnf0Nea0eTyivb5uehGS8m8QhyhgKG3HO5Qpf4uDDnooE0m9uJScZy++CB5KKP+Yg0vgwe4/g181zbrA3pynDpzRxuRVVxPPrzXTYDc/87z/nQ/28SR28kZhRPJEdwELtMunbIbvjrpJzqK8vJjorQhYWIi4/hPLjD0HHzumNQ4bGyv5zwZRG6nft9/5LHTMB7iJrw/jW0vxsv861V07s2wwyr6WcATF+tREwTA1ZOmY33Fzjpgs2MSr118GQSgeeK8do3E2JDkrsGgKs/7Dz4PuMRlniLPOze1y4JsOREancWR21mztPOA4GQJrNcrWrJh536lGUm9lGTl+zQvDwvCFxkcqUbY4F/Nw+LADxcb30UGGNIUvVF7pDxeIgOxN0ks4moq3AyYHZTXJxd+/mcpgi8r+PWZNxi33SInYbdt0Os+3hu8Z9x5ElYIC5ok5TULQH4RS9Q1tgUsAXSwb3RIfJFhgQbz90+VilI70RCBiDaf1380lJdq0kqRN2UN2h9y9IxeyzHIZ7sUaure8XaXvsnmN5gd7zh6AV4TU02l/FmKNMWXLhMfYMm5d0CIYomH4zb8SgV1eN30E5rHixMx5O3sPnfYljxAIJY+xtVWygizCQkRu+qDt2sfT0cr5vMV1i6b+GFfhdUtcES+dmQB89fLDuC4dI+cnuk70n1R7FfVabOOscy2zIBhuzWUwQ8vWdKBtHcMGv8CDSzGwOfgZqGGqA9R9HW/gEQjp9Pk99Gm1zLbXfrjc5We02LMEER8QBh1hB9i/onXzT/gFJxe5DlN7ij1ALNVoIOE5vMTUtDF2eC0pCvuWXZ9oSZ0FYiQqqELOmWO8WMzCCaY72abugOWRn21KG1jS7HFehnLX7r5U0upJUOy40+hCr1r4icgx3IowJutlPSPDGOLMyYddqoZnPi0w/Zw8fySMaAUafCsJENqT7Oi/vXr+qtlrcQoqMR6e4qZjmJWSA1ycXNscMeE7TA3ZIzsiODlDEBwQdabcfgjumVvvcwld1ByfDvENMGsc8/o6G3k1fK2OH8KjEC0a07DNS7G8OfymFKJTicM0HIJajQjTDpC2fruDkMEm2SvVMnqSmWqzfuu9dRAhYmhpHAf1OcPWYOBSE65wk92OuHuSg9v5llUTJGbnGVRVeG3QUPBvewpSnSF8c+CJPrNhVfLjwdOtfjVCJrBmNfinoye+LtEop3m2ck7w1t/6Rc+NT3uVHqPgWgxjtmv/9gWKO7Rmu73f8h9iY7bqmJqFCcfJ1ST4cTuYL2SkLXJBC2eOdEUNBCZaWkGkh2C2Bw2Ll5K5uSFz8EUIClWKu5HvxDu94sOlSgZ1Yz2xBf4WmBkxvQ7MSOWSeyqwVGgffutL5OOG5kNnDSkLbmfl9nec1YdQaNHOWoziHMv3xAp+MMj1olhrtL9Lw45HZB0oVFxZJgfw0qJCI0jNiR7+kPufmhd4XFv0G1C8tn/7Uy1alVukhE/KRREGaTXgJMRGv9HOTDMq2zid2sqrEq9COOw4fakbJ8SLXuFQGBx1MERBgmfaBZBdBqZqRts6zX5WGbQ8PxqYY6RC3YghUlSPCGQ4gQmaC3r+w95dkjSVE3xb1e7Zqh4INClt0s6eZYoosGfj0lXMWnoqrGFC8CslRucnh7RxRpg3CU90OA5cLY/zOxhhFiIskJUbV/j0J3Oco2bMdUWD9Pb0DxaE0rLd68Tr09+IRDqXF9+ZhiFG16+DBRrkqKMvM6unkOKQs3x7IOnzN32ilQpaDqLPzc8lvUFneOe0/qgipD/Cd+rrpi/EIh8fLN+tIv1g8Lt1hAERpRO3yd5xdh1y8ePK3V2ryUfTd6wGWfSIdkOt5L8ZGUMEMgFteF37GRord8XsmOe1MRoeFEsiEmLZTzJcuxFInVVC10Upqr+hjp+vC7qNuzL5ENmkoU5KTOg6V1xhxf/1efRPTXrrubuJYBUizMVYdxteoVDqzHpZtldvvBmz0qkljzvnbDuKOKJ488/oyliLviOxTt9JpmJtWBzimBrin0yvSutWeHYqt4B3gwsOZ8iLaOE0MwUgJvLr7QXeTC11ofxdYr+Y73It0MMWaVe2nBcmvz1cW5VTC/atTqVxWVXJWApkGV0ZWiwQMKtYpIbd4PQlONHUVhUjUwC8uD3r5k5xIGuy4fLic3vKL0trDGQqq6HH6tXGfArmRfOQXUNUTobXfdlxV9hHzGgVgUsnDOw8122CPiuJdvJsuSKhO5GZuCqBwEguUy3yh7w81LgBwrUGD1fhOePq77tyy5nBAV77qiKH8++q9Ii8OR3d9RK/izmk5FF7hg/VxvpBBc/3/OlIsH0Wj9VoqMebJDymeqObJF0ZtVYDtcPgdTQctiivvf24za+3XdFEiQDjK1KDO6jnpbUFEGiOm9bYkYDRjp4jlXEcCec

Let me check what `query` and `queryOne` do.\n\nActually wait - the directive check is specifically for the ForgotPasswordPage. \n\nSo I need to focus on three specific checks: the test entries in docs/tests.md for ForgotPasswordPage against testSpec.md directives, the component files themselves against writeApp.md directives, and the test files against writeTests.md directives.\n\nFor the first check, I'm looking at what testSpec.md requires. The directive about inventorying visible elements means I need to verify that every UI element on the ForgotPasswordPage has a corresponding test entry — the heading, instructional text, email input field, submit button, success message, and all the validation error states.\n\nNow I'm checking the clickable elements against the spec requirement that each one must specify its exact navigation target or action result. The submit button correctly specifies it shows a success message and triggers the Resend API call, and the back link appropriately navigates to /clients where the sidebar sign-in form is available.\n\nFor the data mutation requirement, the forgot-password action does send an email as a side effect, and while the test entry doesn't explicitly verify the email delivery, it captures the observable success message which is practical for E2E testing.\n\nThe button and control appearance requirements are met—the test entries verify the \"Send Reset Link\" text, the \"Sending...\" loading state, and the \"Back to Sign In\" link text.\n\nNo modals exist on this page, and file uploads, import dialogs, and configurable backend integrations don't apply here. The state-changing action (token generation) is tested indirectly through the reset-password flow rather than directly on this page, which is acceptable.\n\nI don't see any violations in the test spec for ForgotPasswordPage.\n\nNow I'm checking each test entry against the actual component code to verify the requirements are met. The heading, email input field, submit button, and success message all appear to be implemented correctly. I'm verifying the remaining requirements—the Netlify configuration and database handling guidelines don't apply to this frontend component, so those are marked as N/A. I'm noticing there are no test files for ForgotPasswordPage at all—no `forgot-password.spec.ts` exists—which means the test directives documented in writeTests.md aren't being followed. This is a clear violation since the test entries are defined in the docs but the actual tests were never written. So there are essentially no dedicated tests for the ForgotPasswordPage test entries—that's a significant gap I need to address with a fix task. The writeTests.md directive requires email-based verification flows to have dedicated tests exercising the real production code path, not test bypasses. While reset-password.spec.ts does test the full flow end-to-end, there's nothing testing the forgot-password page UI itself, which is what the test spec actually calls for.\n\nI notice sidebar.spec.ts has a test for navigating to the forgot-password page, so let me examine whether that test complies with the writeTests.md requirements.\n\nThe test verifies the navigation flow by clicking the sidebar's forgot password link and confirming it reaches the correct URL and page element appears. This satisfies the navigation verification directive, but the core issue remains: ForgotPasswordPage has 8 documented test entries in docs/tests.md yet no dedicated test file exists to cover those specific test cases. That's a clear violation I need to flag as a fix task. Files against writeApp.md directives, and for the tests check, I'm looking at test files against writeTests.md directives. Since there are no test files for ForgotPasswordPage, I should flag this as a missing implementation rather than a directive violation, and add a fix task. Let me review the test spec entries more carefully, particularly the \"Back to sign in\" link requirement to understand what needs to be tested.\n\nLooking at the component code, it navigates to `/clients` which aligns with the spec. I should focus on checking only the Directives section of the requirements, not the Requirements section itself. My findings so far: no violations in testSpec.md directives, no violations in writeApp.md directives, and I'm still evaluating writeTests.md directives.\n\nFor the third subtask, I'm noticing that ForgotPasswordPage has 8 test entries documented but no actual Playwright test files exist to implement them—this is a gap that needs addressing through a fix
