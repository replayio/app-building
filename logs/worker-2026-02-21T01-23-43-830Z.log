Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01).

Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n    27→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n    28→\n    29→2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    30→- Before: 837fc7f\n    31→- After: 366203c\n    32→- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n    33→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n    34→\n    35→2/20/2026: Directive violations — TLP-NAV-01/02 missing Contacts, PageHeader descriptions missing Import button\n    36→- Before: 2cc96fc\n    37→- After: (this commit)\n    38→- Fix: Fixed TLP-NAV-01 and TLP-NAV-02 test entries in docs/tests.md to include \"Contacts\" in the sidebar navigation links (matching CLP-NAV-01/02 which already had it). Updated PageHeader component descriptions for TasksListPage and DealsListPage to mention the Import button (which existed in code and had test entries but was missing from the Components section). Updated Playwright tests for TLP-NAV-01 (added Contacts visibility check) and TLP-NAV-02 (added Contacts navigation check). All 23 tasks-list-page tests pass.\n    39→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the Contacts nav item and Import buttons were omitted from TLP-NAV-01/02 entries and PageHeader component descriptions when those sections were originally written\n    40→\n    41→2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n    42→- Before: edc5279\n    43→- After: (this commit)\n    44→- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n    45→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n    46→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n    47→\n    48→2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n    49→- Before: 1e5a771\n    50→- After: (this commit)\n    51→- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    52→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n    53→\n    54→2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n    55→- Before: 1e5a771\n    56→- After: (this commit)\n    57→- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    58→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n    59→\n    60→2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n    61→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    62→- After: (this commit)\n    63→- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    64→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    65→\n    66→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    67→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    68→- After: (this commit)\n    69→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    70→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    71→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    72→\n    73→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    74→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    75→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    76→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    77→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    78→\n    79→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    80→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    81→\n    82→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    83→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    84→\n    85→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    86→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    87→\n    88→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    89→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    90→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    91→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    92→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    93→\n    94→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    95→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    96→- Before: df7222c\n    97→- After: c0847d0\n    98→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    99→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n   100→\n   101→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n   102→- Before: ef67c9a\n   103→- After: (this commit)\n   104→- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n   105→- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n   106→- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n   107→\n   108→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n   109→- Before: 4e63501\n   110→- After: (this commit)\n   111→- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n   112→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n   113→\n   114→2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n   115→- Before: fbafcda\n   116→- After: (this commit)\n   117→- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n   118→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n   119→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n   120→\n   121→\n   122→\n   123→2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n   124→- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n   125→- Before: fc47dd2\n   126→- After: 8b82e35\n   127→- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n   128→- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n   129→\n   130→2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n   131→- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n   132→- Before: 78daa0a\n   133→- After: fc47dd2\n   134→- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation.

Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n   159→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n   160→- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n   161→\n   162→2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n   163→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n   164→- Before: 0301f38\n   165→- After: 0cd095c\n   166→- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails.

Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    30→\n    31→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    32→  options, buttons).

Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    79→\n    80→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    81→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    82→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    83→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n    84→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n    85→\n    86→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    87→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    88→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    89→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    90→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    91→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    92→\n    93→## Parallel Test Design\n    94→\n    95→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n    96→Write tests with this in mind:\n    97→\n    98→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n    99→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   100→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   101→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   102→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   103→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   104→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   105→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   106→  being unmodified.\n   107→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   108→  you need to interact with.\n   109→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   110→\n   111→## Tips\n   112→\n   113→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   114→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   115→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   116→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   117→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   118→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   119→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   120→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   121→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   122→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019FUbCsdGFNDkogVZgKUDCE","session_id":"6e50de1b-430c-4b99-9ce0-2dd8f3a0d071","uuid":"6a66ef93-72f3-4359-9c77-93cf294a1929"}

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`).

There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019FUbCsdGFNDkogVZgKUDCE","session_id":"6e50de1b-430c-4b99-9ce0-2dd8f3a0d071","uuid":"9e65ef98-2c10-45d5-867d-228fd478d045"}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes.

It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019FUbCsdGFNDkogVZgKUDCE","session_id":"6e50de1b-430c-4b99-9ce0-2dd8f3a0d071","uuid":"e4784907-0718-4bef-bfa0-350d26238e2b"}

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    80→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    81→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019FUbCsdGFNDkogVZgKUDCE","session_id":"6e50de1b-430c-4b99-9ce0-2dd8f3a0d071","uuid":"9407ba2d-961f-446c-bc99-6cbaf9fe4462"}

Here's what I discovered:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Sales CRM App Specification & Directory\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/`\n\n**Key Files:**\n- **AppSpec.md** — Initial product specification defining 6 main pages (ClientsListPage, ClientDetailPage, PersonDetailPage, DealsListPage, DealDetailPage, TasksListPage) with detailed descriptions and mockup links\n- **AppRevisions.md** — Documents 16 major feature additions beyond the original spec, including:\n  - Task Detail Page with notes\n  - Contacts/Team pages with user management\n  - Email notifications with client following\n  - CSV import/export for all entities\n  - Settings page with webhooks and notification preferences\n  - Authentication system with email confirmation and password reset\n  - Pipeline drag-and-drop functionality\n  - Filter dropdowns with search capabilities\n\n- **AppStyle.md** — Styling guidelines for the app\n- **docs/tests.md** (1665 lines) — Comprehensive behavior-driven test specification organized by page, with data-testid requirements and test entry details\n\n---\n\n### 2. Bug Report Format & Examples\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md`\n\nThe bug report document uses this structure:\n\n**Format Structure:**\n```\n## [Date]: [Bug Title] — Brief description\n\n- Before: [git commit hash]\n- After: [git commit hash or \"(this commit)\"]\n- Fix: [Detailed description of the fix]\n- Problem stage: [build/writeApp.md | build/testSpec.md | build/writeTests.md | none]\n- AppRevisions.md: [Status]\n- Directive: [Any new/updated directive added]\n```\n\n**Sections:**\n- Open — Active bugs being worked on\n- Unreviewed — Fixed bugs awaiting review for process improvements\n- Finished — Reviewed bugs with documented lessons learned\n\n**Example (2/20/2026: Add Contacts Page):**\n```\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with searchable table...\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section\n```\n\n**Example (2/14/2026: Attachment Preview):**\n```\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show \n  file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Strategy Directives — \"Think Through Consequences\"\n\n**Location:** `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md` (Line 67)\n\n**The Directive (under \"State-changing actions\"):**\n\n> **\"If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\"**\n\n**Context:** This appears in the **Directives** section of `testSpec.md`, which is the strategy document for writing detailed test specifications. It's specifically about ensuring that all state-changing actions have corresponding tests that verify side effects (like history/timeline entries) happen correctly and atomically.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Related Strategy Organization\n\n**Location:** `/repo/strategies/`\n\nThe strategy system is organized into:\n\n**Messages/** — User-triggered workflows:\n- `buildInitialApp.md` — Build a new app from AppSpec\n- `maintainApp.md` — Run maintenance cycles\n- `addBugReport.md` — Record user-reported bugs\n- `updateScripts.md` — Design new package scripts\n- `analyzeLogs.md` — Search log files\n\n**Jobs/** — Implementation stages:\n- `build/testSpec.md` — Write test specification (contains the \"think through consequences\" directive)\n- `build/writeApp.md` — Write database, backend, and frontend code\n- `build/writeTests.md` — Write Playwright tests\n- `build/testing.md` — Run tests and debug\n- `maintain/checkDirectives.md` — Systematically verify all directives are followed\n- `maintain/fixBugReport.md` — Analyze and fix open bugs\n- `maintain/reviewBugReport.md` — Review fixed bugs for process improvements\n- `maintain/polishApp.md` — Improve overall quality\n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Directives Across Strategies\n\n**writeApp.md** (30+ directives):\n- Never use native `<select>` elements when custom design system exists\n- Attachment displays must show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n- Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes\n- Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions\n\n**writeTests.md** (11 directives):\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely\n- When spec describes file uploads, test actual file upload mechanics (not URL input)\n- Each field interaction described in spec must be tested, not just a subset\n- Apps with login/signup must have complete e2e test\n- Avoid Playwright `getByText()` ambiguity; prefer `getByTestId`\n- Keep `.toPass()` blocks free of nested auto-waiting calls\n\n**testSpec.md** (8 directives including the \"think through consequences\"):\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in mockups\n- Do not substitute easier elements for what mockups show\n- For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result\n- For data mutations, verify persistence and exactly the right side effects occur\n- State-changing actions: **\"Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking\"**\n\n---\n\n### 6. App Architecture Overview\n\nThe Sales CRM app is a multi-page web application built with:\n- **Frontend:** React with Redux state management\n- **Backend:** Netlify Functions (serverless)\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon serverless driver)\n- **Auth:** Custom JWT-based email/password system with Resend for emails\n- **Testing:** Playwright with Replay browser integration\n- **Build:** Vite with TypeScript\n\n**Current Pages (14 total):**\n1. ClientsListPage (/clients)\n2. ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n3. DealsListPage (/deals)\n4. DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)\n5. TasksListPage (/tasks)\n6. TaskDetailPage (/tasks/:taskId)\n7.

Bug Report Format & Examples\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md`\n\nThe bug report document uses this structure:\n\n**Format Structure:**\n```\n## [Date]: [Bug Title] — Brief description\n\n- Before: [git commit hash]\n- After: [git commit hash or \"(this commit)\"]\n- Fix: [Detailed description of the fix]\n- Problem stage: [build/writeApp.md | build/testSpec.md | build/writeTests.md | none]\n- AppRevisions.md: [Status]\n- Directive: [Any new/updated directive added]\n```\n\n**Sections:**\n- Open — Active bugs being worked on\n- Unreviewed — Fixed bugs awaiting review for process improvements\n- Finished — Reviewed bugs with documented lessons learned\n\n**Example (2/20/2026: Add Contacts Page):**\n```\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with searchable table...\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section\n```\n\n**Example (2/14/2026: Attachment Preview):**\n```\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show \n  file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Strategy Directives — \"Think Through Consequences\"\n\n**Location:** `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md` (Line 67)\n\n**The Directive (under \"State-changing actions\"):**\n\n> **\"If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\"**\n\n**Context:** This appears in the **Directives** section of `testSpec.md`, which is the strategy document for writing detailed test specifications. It's specifically about ensuring that all state-changing actions have corresponding tests that verify side effects (like history/timeline entries) happen correctly and atomically.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Related Strategy Organization\n\n**Location:** `/repo/strategies/`\n\nThe strategy system is organized into:\n\n**Messages/** — User-triggered workflows:\n- `buildInitialApp.md` — Build a new app from AppSpec\n- `maintainApp.md` — Run maintenance cycles\n- `addBugReport.md` — Record user-reported bugs\n- `updateScripts.md` — Design new package scripts\n- `analyzeLogs.md` — Search log files\n\n**Jobs/** — Implementation stages:\n- `build/testSpec.md` — Write test specification (contains the \"think through consequences\" directive)\n- `build/writeApp.md` — Write database, backend, and frontend code\n- `build/writeTests.md` — Write Playwright tests\n- `build/testing.md` — Run tests and debug\n- `maintain/checkDirectives.md` — Systematically verify all directives are followed\n- `maintain/fixBugReport.md` — Analyze and fix open bugs\n- `maintain/reviewBugReport.md` — Review fixed bugs for process improvements\n- `maintain/polishApp.md` — Improve overall quality\n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Directives Across Strategies\n\n**writeApp.md** (30+ directives):\n- Never use native `<select>` elements when custom design system exists\n- Attachment displays must show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n- Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes\n- Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions\n\n**writeTests.md** (11 directives):\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely\n- When spec describes file uploads, test actual file upload mechanics (not URL input)\n- Each field interaction described in spec must be tested, not just a subset\n- Apps with login/signup must have complete e2e test\n- Avoid Playwright `getByText()` ambiguity; prefer `getByTestId`\n- Keep `.toPass()` blocks free of nested auto-waiting calls\n\n**testSpec.md** (8 directives including the \"think through consequences\"):\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in mockups\n- Do not substitute easier elements for what mockups show\n- For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result\n- For data mutations, verify persistence and exactly the right side effects occur\n- State-changing actions: **\"Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking\"**\n\n---\n\n### 6. App Architecture Overview\n\nThe Sales CRM app is a multi-page web application built with:\n- **Frontend:** React with Redux state management\n- **Backend:** Netlify Functions (serverless)\n- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon serverless driver)\n- **Auth:** Custom JWT-based email/password system with Resend for emails\n- **Testing:** Playwright with Replay browser integration\n- **Build:** Vite with TypeScript\n\n**Current Pages (14 total):**\n1. ClientsListPage (/clients)\n2. ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n3. DealsListPage (/deals)\n4. DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)\n5. TasksListPage (/tasks)\n6. TaskDetailPage (/tasks/:taskId)\n7. PersonDetailPage (/individuals/:individualId)\n8. ContactsListPage (/contacts)\n9. UsersListPage (/users)\n10. UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n11. SettingsPage (/settings)\n12. ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n13. ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n14. ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n\n---\n\n### File Paths Summary\n\n- **App specs:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md`, `AppRevisions.md`, `AppStyle.md`\n- **Bug reports:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md`\n- **Test spec:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`\n- **\"Think through consequences\" directive:** `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md` (line 67)\n- **Strategy files:** `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/` and `/repo/strategies/jobs/maintain/`"}],"totalDurationMs":41470,"totalTokens":41026,"totalToolUseCount":21,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1198,"cache_read_input_tokens":37998,"output_tokens":1830,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1198},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n    13→- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n    14→- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Webhook Setup Guides section documenting the new feature\n    15→\n    16→2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n    17→- Before: 6d387c9\n    18→- After: (this commit)\n    19→- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n    20→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n    21→- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n    22→\n    23→2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    24→- Before: e4b5f26\n    25→- After: (this commit)\n    26→- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n    27→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n    28→\n    29→2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n    30→- Before: 837fc7f\n    31→- After: 366203c\n    32→- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n    33→- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n    34→\n    35→2/20/2026: Directive violations — TLP-NAV-01/02 missing Contacts, PageHeader descriptions missing Import button\n    36→- Before: 2cc96fc\n    37→- After: (this commit)\n    38→- Fix: Fixed TLP-NAV-01 and TLP-NAV-02 test entries in docs/tests.md to include \"Contacts\" in the sidebar navigation links (matching CLP-NAV-01/02 which already had it). Updated PageHeader component descriptions for TasksListPage and DealsListPage to mention the Import button (which existed in code and had test entries but was missing from the Components section). Updated Playwright tests for TLP-NAV-01 (added Contacts visibility check) and TLP-NAV-02 (added Contacts navigation check). All 23 tasks-list-page tests pass.\n    39→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the Contacts nav item and Import buttons were omitted from TLP-NAV-01/02 entries and PageHeader component descriptions when those sections were originally written\n    40→\n    41→2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n    42→- Before: edc5279\n    43→- After: (this commit)\n    44→- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n    45→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n    46→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n    47→\n    48→2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n    49→- Before: 1e5a771\n    50→- After: (this commit)\n    51→- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    52→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n    53→\n    54→2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n    55→- Before: 1e5a771\n    56→- After: (this commit)\n    57→- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    58→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n    59→\n    60→2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n    61→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    62→- After: (this commit)\n    63→- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    64→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    65→\n    66→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    67→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    68→- After: (this commit)\n    69→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    70→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    71→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    72→\n    73→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    74→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    75→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    76→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    77→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    78→\n    79→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    80→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    81→\n    82→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    83→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    84→\n    85→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    86→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    87→\n    88→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    89→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    90→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    91→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    92→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    93→\n    94→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    95→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    96→- Before: df7222c\n    97→- After: c0847d0\n    98→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    99→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n   100→\n   101→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n   102→- Before: ef67c9a\n   103→- After: (this commit)\n   104→- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n   105→- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n   106→- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n   107→\n   108→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n   109→- Before: 4e63501\n   110→- After: (this commit)\n   111→- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView.

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Webhook Setup Guides section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: e4b5f26\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n\n2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: 837fc7f\n- After: 366203c\n- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n\n2/20/2026: Directive violations — TLP-NAV-01/02 missing Contacts, PageHeader descriptions missing Import button\n- Before: 2cc96fc\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Fixed TLP-NAV-01 and TLP-NAV-02 test entries in docs/tests.md to include \"Contacts\" in the sidebar navigation links (matching CLP-NAV-01/02 which already had it). Updated PageHeader component descriptions for TasksListPage and DealsListPage to mention the Import button (which existed in code and had test entries but was missing from the Components section). Updated Playwright tests for TLP-NAV-01 (added Contacts visibility check) and TLP-NAV-02 (added Contacts navigation check). All 23 tasks-list-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the Contacts nav item and Import buttons were omitted from TLP-NAV-01/02 entries and PageHeader component descriptions when those sections were originally written\n\n2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n- Before: edc5279\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar.

Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Webhook Setup Guides section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n- Before: 6d387c9\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added ContactsListPage at /contacts with sidebar navigation link (Contact icon). Page features a searchable table of all individuals with columns: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients (badges). Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with 300ms debounce. Includes pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and Add Contact modal (name, title, email, phone, location fields). Clicking a contact row navigates to /individuals/:id (PersonDetailPage). Enhanced backend individuals list endpoint to return email, phone, location, associated client names, pagination support, and multi-field search. Expanded individualsSlice with list state management (items, total, page). Created 6 new components (ContactsPageHeader, ContactsSearchBar, ContactsTable, ContactsPagination, AddContactModal, ContactsListPage). Added 9 new Playwright tests (CTLP-HDR-01/02/03, CTLP-SRCH-01/02/03, CTLP-TBL-01/02, CTLP-PGN-01). Updated CLP-NAV-01/02 to include Contacts nav item.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — Contacts page was not part of the original spec)\n- AppRevisions.md: Already updated with Contacts Page section documenting the new feature\n\n2/20/2026: Add email integration for client follow notifications. Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: e4b5f26\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added client following system with follow/unfollow toggle button on client detail page (FollowButton component, only visible when authenticated). Added email notification preferences to Settings page (NotificationPreferencesSection with 7 toggles: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added — all default to enabled, only visible when authenticated). Created two new database tables: client_followers (user-client junction with unique constraint) and notification_preferences (per-user toggles). Created two new API endpoints: /.netlify/functions/client-follow (GET/POST, requires auth) and /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences (GET/PUT, requires auth). Created notifications utility (netlify/utils/notifications.ts) that queries followers and their preferences, then sends emails via Resend API. Integrated fire-and-forget notification calls into existing backend functions (clients.ts, client-tasks.ts, client-deals.ts, client-people.ts, deals.ts) wherever timeline events are created. Actor is excluded from notifications. Added 6 new Playwright tests (STP-NP-01/02/03, CDP-FOL-01/02/03) and updated STP-HDR-01.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — client following and email notifications were not part of the original spec)\n\n2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n- Before: 837fc7f\n- After: 366203c\n- Fix: Added email confirmation requirement for new signups (auto-confirmed in IS_TEST mode). Signup now creates unconfirmed user, sends confirmation email via Resend API, and returns needsConfirmation status. Added \"Forgot password?\" link in sidebar auth form that navigates to /auth/forgot-password. Created three new pages: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password?token=...), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email?token=...). Added confirm-email, forgot-password, and reset-password API endpoints to auth function. Login now checks email_confirmed (bypassed in test mode). Added email_tokens table migration and email_confirmed column migration to migrate-db.ts. Added 5 new Playwright tests (AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01). All 9 auth tests pass.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement — email confirmation and forgot password were not part of the previous auth implementation)\n\n2/20/2026: Directive violations — TLP-NAV-01/02 missing Contacts, PageHeader descriptions missing Import button\n- Before: 2cc96fc\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Fixed TLP-NAV-01 and TLP-NAV-02 test entries in docs/tests.md to include \"Contacts\" in the sidebar navigation links (matching CLP-NAV-01/02 which already had it). Updated PageHeader component descriptions for TasksListPage and DealsListPage to mention the Import button (which existed in code and had test entries but was missing from the Components section). Updated Playwright tests for TLP-NAV-01 (added Contacts visibility check) and TLP-NAV-02 (added Contacts navigation check). All 23 tasks-list-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the Contacts nav item and Import buttons were omitted from TLP-NAV-01/02 entries and PageHeader component descriptions when those sections were originally written\n\n2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n- Before: edc5279\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — the test spec (DDP-HDR-02) correctly specified that editing the client field should update the deal, but the Playwright test did not actually verify client field editing, allowing the missing implementation to go undetected\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: tests must exercise each specific field interaction described in the spec entry, not just a subset\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n- Before: 0cd095c\n- After: 78daa0a\n- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior. Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n\n2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n- Before: 0301f38\n- After: 0cd095c\n- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":2,"oldLines":6,"newStart":2,"newLines":9,"lines":[" "," ## Open"," ","+2/21/2026: Adding a relationship to a contact does not update the other contact to show the reciprocal relationship.","+- When you add a relationship between two contacts (e.g., Contact A \"reports to\" Contact B), only Contact A shows the relationship.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":65,"oldLines":6,"newStart":65,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," - State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately.
