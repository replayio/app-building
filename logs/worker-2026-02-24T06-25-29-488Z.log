Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly.

Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0b70a58b-9b95-4542-8864-06cbff3311cc","uuid":"d69c3b66-1dcd-4ac8-9e3c-5b97ccaf722c","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\n     4→web apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n     5→\n     6→Key directories:\n     7→\n     8→* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n     9→* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n    10→* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    12→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    13→  the work currently being done.\n    14→\n    15→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    16→external services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n    17→\n    18→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    19→\n    20→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n    21→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    22→2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n    23→3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    24→   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    25→\n    26→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    27→matching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    28→\n    29→## Worker Execution\n    30→\n    31→The worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\n    32→it passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    33→\n    34→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    36→\n    37→The worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\n    38→jobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    39→\n    40→When you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    41→\n    42→## Job System\n    43→\n    44→Work is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\n    45→with a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\n    46→and a `timestamp`:\n    47→\n    48→```json\n    49→{\n    50→  \"groups\": [\n    51→    {\n    52→      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    53→      \"jobs\": [\n    54→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    55→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    57→      ],\n    58→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    59→    }\n    60→  ]\n    61→}\n    62→```\n    63→\n    64→The agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n    65→\n    66→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n    67→  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n    68→  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n    69→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    70→\n    71→All jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\n    72→all checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\n    73→sub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    74→\n    75→**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n    76→\n    77→- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    78→  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    79→- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n    80→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    81→- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n    82→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    83→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n    84→- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n    85→\n    86→## Tech Stack\n    87→\n    88→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    89→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    90→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    91→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    92→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    93→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    94→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    95→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    96→\n    97→## Database\n    98→\n    99→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   100→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   101→frontend components.\n   102→\n   103→## Quality Gates\n   104→\n   105→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   106→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   107→\n   108→## Commits\n   109→\n   110→The worker commits automatically after each iteration.

The outer container (`.ezxFuW`) is a single-column grid where each child is a full-width row.\n\n```css\n/* Outer list container */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* single column, full-width rows */\ngrid-template-rows: 36px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 308px;\n                  /* ^group header  ^issue rows...                              ^spacer */\n```\n\n- **Group header row**: 36px tall\n- **Issue row**: 44px tall\n- The list container has 14 children: 1 group header + 12 issue rows + 1 spacer\n\n### Issue Row Structure\n\nEach issue row is an `<a>` tag (the full row is clickable) wrapping an inner grid `<div>` with **7 named grid columns**:\n\n| Column       | Content Example          | Font Size | Font Weight | Color             |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `checkbox`   | (empty/checkbox)         | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `priority`   | (priority icon)          | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `identifier` | \"PRO-1247\", \"TT-38\"     | 13px      | 450         | rgb(91, 91, 93)   |\n| `status`     | (status icon)            | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `title`      | \"Contact form not working\" | 13px    | 500         | rgb(26, 26, 26)   |\n| `created`    | (date/avatar info)       | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n| (additional) | (assignee, labels, etc.) | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n\nKey observations:\n- **Identifier** uses muted color `rgb(91, 91, 93)` / `#5b5b5d` with semi-bold weight 450\n- **Title** uses primary color `rgb(26, 26, 26)` / `#1a1a1a` with medium weight 500\n- Both use 13px font size (not the body 16px)\n- The grid uses **named column tracks** (`checkbox`, `priority`, `identifier`, `status`, `title`, `created`) for semantic column placement\n\n### Issue Row Styling\n\n```css\n/* Issue row (A tag) */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-column: 1 / -1;      /* spans full width */\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 44px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nborder: none;              /* 0px none — no visible row borders */\ncursor: default;\ntext-decoration: none;     /* no underline on the link */\noutline: none;             /* focus-visible override */\n```\n\n### Row Separation\n\nRows have **no visible borders** between them. Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nfont-size: 16px;\nfont-weight: 400;\n```\n\nGroup headers contain section names (e.g., \"Other active\") with a count badge (\"19\").\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —         |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`  | ~6% black |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(239, 239, 239)`     | `#efefef` |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(245, 245, 245)`     | `#f5f5f5` |\n| Alt hover (mid)   | `rgb(247, 247, 247)`     | `#f7f7f7` |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(237, 237, 237)`     | `#ededed` |\n\nAll hover backgrounds observed in stylesheets:\n- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)` — primary interactive hover\n- `rgb(239, 239, 239)` — pressed/active\n- `rgb(245, 245, 245)` — sidebar hover\n- `rgb(247, 247, 247)` — light hover\n- `rgb(237, 237, 237)` — selected state\n- `transparent` — reset/clear hover\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: var(--control-border-radius, 4px);\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(45, 46, 47);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background         | Description                |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Default | transparent        | No background              |\n| Hover   | rgb(247, 247, 247) | `#f7f7f7` — subtle gray    |\n| Active  | rgb(238, 238, 238) | `#eeeeee` — slightly darker|\n\nThe hover transition uses `var(--speed-highlightFadeIn)` for a fast, smooth appearance.\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n| `1px solid var(--gray4)`             | Subtle separators        |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#dcdcdc`.\nHover border uses `var(--normal-border-hover)` and `var(--gray5)` for a slightly darker state.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value                              | Usage                     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| `var(--control-border-radius)` 4px | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px                                | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px                                | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%                                | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows are very subtle and use low-opacity black.

I have all the information you need. Let me summarize the patterns used in these files comprehensively.\n\n---\n\n## COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\n### 1. DETAIL PAGE PATTERN (DealDetailPage.tsx & PersonDetailPage.tsx)\n\n**Component Structure:**\n- Functional component with React hooks\n- Uses `useParams` for route parameters (`dealId`, `individualId`)\n- Single top-level container: `<div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\">`\n- Data-testid: `data-testid=\"deal-detail-page\"` or `data-testid=\"person-detail-page\"`\n\n**Data Fetching Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// From DealDetailPage.tsx (lines 34-49)\nconst fetchDeal = useCallback(async () => {\n  if (!dealId) return\n  try {\n    const res = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/deals/${dealId}`)\n    const data = await res.json()\n    setDeal(data)\n  } catch {\n    // silently fail\n  } finally {\n    setLoading(false)\n  }\n}, [dealId])\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchDeal()\n}, [fetchDeal])\n```\n\nKey patterns:\n- Fetch endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/{resource}/{id}`\n- State: `useState<ResourceInfo | null>(null)` + `useState<boolean>(true)` for loading\n- Error handling: Silent catch blocks\n- Finally block: Always set loading to false\n\n**State Management:**\n- **Deal data:** `const [deal, setDeal] = useState<DealInfo | null>(null)`\n- **Loading:** `const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)`\n- **Refresh mechanism:** `const [historyRefreshKey, setHistoryRefreshKey] = useState(0)` - used for child component refresh\n- Update via: `setHistoryRefreshKey(k => k + 1)` to trigger re-fetch in child\n\n**Update Methods Pattern:**\n```typescript\nconst handleUpdateField = async (field: string, value: string) => {\n  if (!dealId || !deal) return\n  const body: Record<string, unknown> = {}\n  // Field-specific preprocessing\n  if (field === 'value') {\n    const numericValue = value.replace(/[$,]/g, '')\n    body.value = numericValue || null\n  } else {\n    body[field] = value\n  }\n  try {\n    const res = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/deals/${dealId}`, {\n      method: 'PUT',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify(body),\n    })\n    if (res.ok) {\n      const updated = await res.json()\n      setDeal(updated)\n    }\n  } catch {\n    // silently fail\n  }\n}\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Fetch with PUT method to same resource endpoint\n- Response is new state (not manual merge)\n- No loading spinners during updates\n- Silent error handling throughout\n\n**Loading/Error States:**\n```typescript\nif (loading) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\" data-testid=\"deal-detail-page\">\n      <p>Loading...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nif (!deal) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\" data-testid=\"deal-detail-page\">\n      <p>Deal not found</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**CSS Classes:**\n- Container: `page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3` (padding responsive, mobile-first)\n- Uses Tailwind utilities for responsive design\n\n**Component Composition:**\nEach detail page wraps multiple section components and passes callbacks:\n```typescript\n<DealHeader\n  dealName={deal.name}\n  clientName={deal.client_name}\n  onUpdateField={handleUpdateField}\n  onChangeStage={handleChangeStage}\n/>\n<LinkedTasksSection dealId={deal.id} clientId={deal.client_id} />\n<DealAttachmentsSection dealId={deal.id} clientId={deal.client_id} />\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. HEADER COMPONENT PATTERN (DealHeader.tsx & PersonHeader.tsx)\n\n**DealHeader Props:**\n```typescript\ninterface DealHeaderProps {\n  dealName: string\n  clientName: string\n  value: string | number | null\n  owner: string | null\n  stage: string\n  onUpdateField: (field: string, value: string) => Promise<void>\n  onChangeStage: (newStage: string) => Promise<void>\n}\n```\n\n**State Management:**\n```typescript\nconst [selectedStage, setSelectedStage] = useState(stage)\nconst [stageDropdownOpen, setStageDropdownOpen] = useState(false)\nconst [editingField, setEditingField] = useState<string | null>(null)\nconst [editValue, setEditValue] = useState('')\nconst stageRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)\nconst inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)\n```\n\n**Editing Pattern:**\n- Conditional rendering: Field shows as button until clicked\n- Click triggers: `startEditing(field, currentValue)`\n- Input fields have `inputRef` for auto-focus on mount\n- Save on blur or Enter key\n- Cancel on Escape key\n- Formatting happens before display (e.g., `formatValue` for currency)\n\n**Inline Edit Example:**\n```typescript\n{editingField === 'client_name' ? (\n  <input\n    ref={inputRef}\n    className=\"deal-header-input\"\n    value={editValue}\n    onChange={e => setEditValue(e.target.value)}\n    onBlur={handleSave}\n    onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}\n    data-testid=\"deal-client-input\"\n  />\n) : (\n  <button\n    className=\"deal-header-value-btn\"\n    onClick={() => startEditing('client_name', clientName)}\n    data-testid=\"deal-client-value\"\n  >\n    {clientName}\n  </button>\n)}\n```\n\n**Dropdown Pattern (Stage):**\n```typescript\nconst [stageDropdownOpen, setStageDropdownOpen] = useState(false)\nconst stageRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const handleClickOutside = (e: MouseEvent) => {\n    if (stageRef.current && !stageRef.current.contains(e.target as Node)) {\n      setStageDropdownOpen(false)\n    }\n  }\n  document.addEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside)\n  return () => document.removeEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside)\n}, [])\n\n// Render:\n{stageDropdownOpen && (\n  <div className=\"deal-stage-dropdown-menu\" data-testid=\"deal-stage-dropdown-menu\">\n    {STAGES.map(s => (\n      <button\n        className={`deal-stage-dropdown-option ${selectedStage === s ? 'selected' : ''}`}\n        onClick={() => { setSelectedStage(s); setStageDropdownOpen(false) }}\n      >\n        {s}\n      </button>\n    ))}\n  </div>\n)}\n```\n\n**Data-testid Pattern for DealHeader:**\n- `deal-header` (container)\n- `deal-title`\n- `deal-client-field`, `deal-client-value`, `deal-client-input`\n- `deal-value-field`, `deal-value-value`, `deal-value-input`\n- `deal-owner-field`, `deal-owner-value`, `deal-owner-input`\n- `deal-stage-field`, `deal-stage-dropdown`, `deal-stage-dropdown-menu`, `deal-stage-option`\n- `deal-change-stage-button`\n\n**PersonHeader Props:**\n```typescript\ninterface PersonHeaderProps {\n  name: string\n  title: string | null\n  email: string | null\n  phone: string | null\n  location: string | null\n  associatedClients: AssociatedClient[]\n}\n```\n\n**PersonHeader Features:**\n- Name in `<h1 className=\"person-name\">`\n- Conditional rendering of fields (no editing, read-only)\n- Icons for contact info (email, phone, location)\n- Associated clients as clickable navigation buttons\n- `useNavigate()` for routing: `navigate(`/clients/${client.client_id}`)`\n\n**PersonHeader Data-testids:**\n- `person-header`\n- `person-name`\n- `person-title`\n- `person-email`, `person-phone`, `person-location`\n- `person-associated-clients`\n- `associated-client-link`\n\n**CSS Classes:**\nBoth headers use semantic class naming:\n- `person-header` / `deal-header` (containers)\n- `person-header-title` / `deal-header-title` (titles)\n- `person-header-fields` / `deal-header-fields`\n- `person-header-field` / `deal-header-field` (individual field containers)\n- `person-header-label` / `deal-header-label`\n- Buttons: `deal-header-value-btn`, `deal-header-input`\n\n---\n\n### 3. SECTION COMPONENT PATTERN\n\nAll section components follow the same general structure:\n\n**Base Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface ComponentProps {\n  dealId: string\n  [otherProps]: type\n}\n\nexport default function SectionComponent({ dealId, ...props }: ComponentProps) {\n  const [items, setItems] = useState<Item[]>([])\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n\n  const fetchItems = useCallback(async () => {\n    try {\n      const res = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/deals/${dealId}/endpoint`)\n      const data = await res.json()\n      setItems(data.items || [])\n    } catch {\n      // silently fail\n    } finally {\n      setLoading(false)\n    }\n  }, [dealId])\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchItems()\n  }, [fetchItems])\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"person-section\" data-testid=\"section-name\">\n      <div className=\"person-section-header\">\n        <div className=\"person-section-heading\">\n          <svg>...</svg>\n          <h2 data-testid=\"section-heading\">Section Title</h2>\n        </div>\n        {/* Actions button if present */}\n        <div className=\"person-section-actions\">\n          <button className=\"btn-primary\">Action</button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      {loading ? (\n        <p className=\"person-section-loading\">Loading...</p>\n      ) : items.length > 0 ?

DETAIL PAGE PATTERN (DealDetailPage.tsx & PersonDetailPage.tsx)\n\n**Component Structure:**\n- Functional component with React hooks\n- Uses `useParams` for route parameters (`dealId`, `individualId`)\n- Single top-level container: `<div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\">`\n- Data-testid: `data-testid=\"deal-detail-page\"` or `data-testid=\"person-detail-page\"`\n\n**Data Fetching Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// From DealDetailPage.tsx (lines 34-49)\nconst fetchDeal = useCallback(async () => {\n  if (!dealId) return\n  try {\n    const res = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/deals/${dealId}`)\n    const data = await res.json()\n    setDeal(data)\n  } catch {\n    // silently fail\n  } finally {\n    setLoading(false)\n  }\n}, [dealId])\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchDeal()\n}, [fetchDeal])\n```\n\nKey patterns:\n- Fetch endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/{resource}/{id}`\n- State: `useState<ResourceInfo | null>(null)` + `useState<boolean>(true)` for loading\n- Error handling: Silent catch blocks\n- Finally block: Always set loading to false\n\n**State Management:**\n- **Deal data:** `const [deal, setDeal] = useState<DealInfo | null>(null)`\n- **Loading:** `const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)`\n- **Refresh mechanism:** `const [historyRefreshKey, setHistoryRefreshKey] = useState(0)` - used for child component refresh\n- Update via: `setHistoryRefreshKey(k => k + 1)` to trigger re-fetch in child\n\n**Update Methods Pattern:**\n```typescript\nconst handleUpdateField = async (field: string, value: string) => {\n  if (!dealId || !deal) return\n  const body: Record<string, unknown> = {}\n  // Field-specific preprocessing\n  if (field === 'value') {\n    const numericValue = value.replace(/[$,]/g, '')\n    body.value = numericValue || null\n  } else {\n    body[field] = value\n  }\n  try {\n    const res = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/deals/${dealId}`, {\n      method: 'PUT',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify(body),\n    })\n    if (res.ok) {\n      const updated = await res.json()\n      setDeal(updated)\n    }\n  } catch {\n    // silently fail\n  }\n}\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Fetch with PUT method to same resource endpoint\n- Response is new state (not manual merge)\n- No loading spinners during updates\n- Silent error handling throughout\n\n**Loading/Error States:**\n```typescript\nif (loading) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\" data-testid=\"deal-detail-page\">\n      <p>Loading...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nif (!deal) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3\" data-testid=\"deal-detail-page\">\n      <p>Deal not found</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**CSS Classes:**\n- Container: `page-content p-6 max-sm:p-3` (padding responsive, mobile-first)\n- Uses Tailwind utilities for responsive design\n\n**Component Composition:**\nEach detail page wraps multiple section components and passes callbacks:\n```typescript\n<DealHeader\n  dealName={deal.name}\n  clientName={deal.client_name}\n  onUpdateField={handleUpdateField}\n  onChangeStage={handleChangeStage}\n/>\n<LinkedTasksSection dealId={deal.id} clientId={deal.client_id} />\n<DealAttachmentsSection dealId={deal.id} clientId={deal.client_id} />\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. HEADER COMPONENT PATTERN (DealHeader.tsx & PersonHeader.tsx)\n\n**DealHeader Props:**\n```typescript\ninterface DealHeaderProps {\n  dealName: string\n  clientName: string\n  value: string | number | null\n  owner: string | null\n  stage: string\n  onUpdateField: (field: string, value: string) => Promise<void>\n  onChangeStage: (newStage: string) => Promise<void>\n}\n```\n\n**State Management:**\n```typescript\nconst [selectedStage, setSelectedStage] = useState(stage)\nconst [stageDropdownOpen, setStageDropdownOpen] = useState(false)\nconst [editingField, setEditingField] = useState<string | null>(null)\nconst [editValue, setEditValue] = useState('')\nconst stageRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)\nconst inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)\n```\n\n**Editing Pattern:**\n- Conditional rendering: Field shows as button until clicked\n- Click triggers: `startEditing(field, currentValue)`\n- Input fields have `inputRef` for auto-focus on mount\n- Save on blur or Enter key\n- Cancel on Escape key\n- Formatting happens before display (e.g., `formatValue` for currency)\n\n**Inline Edit Example:**\n```typescript\n{editingField === 'client_name' ? (\n  <input\n    ref={inputRef}\n    className=\"deal-header-input\"\n    value={editValue}\n    onChange={e => setEditValue(e.target.value)}\n    onBlur={handleSave}\n    onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}\n    data-testid=\"deal-client-input\"\n  />\n) : (\n  <button\n    className=\"deal-header-value-btn\"\n    onClick={() => startEditing('client_name', clientName)}\n    data-testid=\"deal-client-value\"\n  >\n    {clientName}\n  </button>\n)}\n```\n\n**Dropdown Pattern (Stage):**\n```typescript\nconst [stageDropdownOpen, setStageDropdownOpen] = useState(false)\nconst stageRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const handleClickOutside = (e: MouseEvent) => {\n    if (stageRef.current && !stageRef.current.contains(e.target as Node)) {\n      setStageDropdownOpen(false)\n    }\n  }\n  document.addEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside)\n  return () => document.removeEventListener('mousedown', handleClickOutside)\n}, [])\n\n// Render:\n{stageDropdownOpen && (\n  <div className=\"deal-stage-dropdown-menu\" data-testid=\"deal-stage-dropdown-menu\">\n    {STAGES.map(s => (\n      <button\n        className={`deal-stage-dropdown-option ${selectedStage === s ? 'selected' : ''}`}\n        onClick={() => { setSelectedStage(s); setStageDropdownOpen(false) }}\n      >\n        {s}\n      </button>\n    ))}\n  </div>\n)}\n```\n\n**Data-testid Pattern for DealHeader:**\n- `deal-header` (container)\n- `deal-title`\n- `deal-client-field`, `deal-client-value`, `deal-client-input`\n- `deal-value-field`, `deal-value-value`, `deal-value-input`\n- `deal-owner-field`, `deal-owner-value`, `deal-owner-input`\n- `deal-stage-field`, `deal-stage-dropdown`, `deal-stage-dropdown-menu`, `deal-stage-option`\n- `deal-change-stage-button`\n\n**PersonHeader Props:**\n```typescript\ninterface PersonHeaderProps {\n  name: string\n  title: string | null\n  email: string | null\n  phone: string | null\n  location: string | null\n  associatedClients: AssociatedClient[]\n}\n```\n\n**PersonHeader Features:**\n- Name in `<h1 className=\"person-name\">`\n- Conditional rendering of fields (no editing, read-only)\n- Icons for contact info (email, phone, location)\n- Associated clients as clickable navigation buttons\n- `useNavigate()` for routing: `navigate(`/clients/${client.client_id}`)`\n\n**PersonHeader Data-testids:**\n- `person-header`\n- `person-name`\n- `person-title`\n- `person-email`, `person-phone`, `person-location`\n- `person-associated-clients`\n- `associated-client-link`\n\n**CSS Classes:**\nBoth headers use semantic class naming:\n- `person-header` / `deal-header` (containers)\n- `person-header-title` / `deal-header-title` (titles)\n- `person-header-fields` / `deal-header-fields`\n- `person-header-field` / `deal-header-field` (individual field containers)\n- `person-header-label` / `deal-header-label`\n- Buttons: `deal-header-value-btn`, `deal-header-input`\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Let me also check the deals.ts backend to understand what endpoints exist for deals, since the ClientDetailPage will need to interact with deals.\n\nActually, I have enough context now. Let me also read the rest of the CSS to see if there are any additional styles I should know about.\n\nLet me now start working through the jobs. I need to:\n\n1. Build backend endpoints needed for the ClientDetailPage (client detail data, timeline events, attachments by client, people by client, deals by client)\n2. Build each component\n3. Wire up the page\n\nFirst, let me understand what backend endpoints I need:\n\n\nThe basic client endpoint already exists, but I need to add several new ones: deals, people, and attachments filtered by client, plus a timeline endpoint for events, and endpoints to upload and delete attachments.\n\nI also need to handle person associations and timeline event creation. The PUT endpoint for updating client info already exists, so I can use that for source data.\n\nMy plan is to extend the clients backend with these sub-resources first, then build out each component, and finally wire everything together on the detail page. Let me check how the existing deals backend handles sub-resources so I can follow the same pattern.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11781,"cache_read_input_tokens":97670,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11781,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0b70a58b-9b95-4542-8864-06cbff3311cc","uuid":"903c6fcb-482e-4468-a609-bd341215d216"}

I need to:\n\n1. First, extend the clients backend to support sub-resources (deals, people, attachments, timeline)\n2. Build each component\n3. Add CSS styles for the new components\n4. Wire up the page\n\nLet me also check if AppRevisions.md exists.\n\nLet me start building. The approach will be:\n\n1. First, update the clients.ts backend to add sub-resource endpoints\n2. Build ClientHeader component\n3. Build QuickActions component\n4. Build SourceInfoSection component\n5. Build TasksSection (replace existing ClientTasksSection)\n\n\n6. Build DealsSection, AttachmentsSection, PeopleSection, and TimelineSection\n7. Wire up ClientDetailPage\n\nFor the backend, I need to add endpoints for retrieving deals and managing people associations—getting the list of people for a client, creating new people and linking them, and removing associations.\n\nI also need to handle attachments and timeline events. But looking at what's already available, the tasks endpoint supports filtering by client_id through query parameters, and deals can be filtered the same way. For attachments, people, and timeline events, I'll need to add those sub-resource endpoints to the clients backend.\n\nLet me start building the components now and extend the backend as needed.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":13003,"cache_read_input_tokens":109451,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":13003,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0b70a58b-9b95-4542-8864-06cbff3311cc","uuid":"4004908d-90e3-47de-aba9-8820cd72f940"}

Let me look more closely - the spec says \"Fields: Name (required), Role/Title, Email, Phone\" for creating new person. I have the role input but no title input. Let me add a title input field.\n\nWait, actually looking more carefully, the test spec says:\n- \"Fields: Person (required, search/select), Role/Title (text input)\" for search mode\n\n\n- \"Fields: Name (required), Role/Title, Email, Phone\" for create mode\n\nIn my create mode, I have role but not title. Looking at the data model, the individual has `title` as a field, and the `client_individuals` join table has `role`. So `title` is on the individual, and `role` is on the relationship. When creating a new person, I need to fill in both their personal title and the role for the relationship. Let me add the title field.\n\nI see the issue now—I declared `newTitle` and it's being used, but `setNewTitle` is never called because there's no input field for it.
