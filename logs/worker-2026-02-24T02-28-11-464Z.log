See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    12→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    13→  the work currently being done.\n    14→\n    15→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    16→external services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n    17→\n    18→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    19→\n    20→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n    21→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    22→2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n    23→3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    24→   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    25→\n    26→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    27→matching strategy.

The file contains an object\n    45→with a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\n    46→and a `timestamp`:\n    47→\n    48→```json\n    49→{\n    50→  \"groups\": [\n    51→    {\n    52→      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    53→      \"jobs\": [\n    54→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    55→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    57→      ],\n    58→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    59→    }\n    60→  ]\n    61→}\n    62→```\n    63→\n    64→The agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly.

Group related jobs together — for example,\n    72→all checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\n    73→sub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    74→\n    75→**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n    76→\n    77→- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    78→  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    79→- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n    80→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    81→- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n    82→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    83→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n    84→- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n    85→\n    86→## Tech Stack\n    87→\n    88→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    89→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    90→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    91→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    92→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    93→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    94→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    95→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    96→\n    97→## Database\n    98→\n    99→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"14995524-8270-4611-952f-856353ca0029","uuid":"9c5fe8f0-72e6-4074-a509-3cabad6089b8","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

The ClientDetailPage section at line 444 is empty - it just has the heading `## ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)` with no content. I need to fill it in with components and test entries.\n\nLet me create a todo list and start working through all the jobs.\n\nLooking at the mockup carefully:\n\n**ClientDetailPage mockup analysis:**\n\n1. **Header area (top):**\n   - Client name: \"Acme Corp\" (large heading)\n   - Type badge: \"Organization\" \n   - Status badge: \"Active\"\n   - Tags: \"Enterprise\", \"Software\", \"High Priority\"\n   - Referral source with an edit pencil icon\n   - Quick action buttons on the right: Add Task, Add Deal, Add Attachment, Add Person (each with an icon and label)\n\n2. **Source Info section:**\n   - \"Source Info\" heading with \"Edit\" button (pencil icon) at top right\n   - Fields: Acquisition Source: \"Referral (John Smith)\", Campaign: \"None\", Channel: \"Direct Sales\", Date Acquired: \"2023-01-15\"\n\n3. **Tasks section (left column):**\n   - \"Tasks\" heading with \"Unresolved tasks\" label on the right\n   - Three tasks with checkboxes: \"Follow up on proposal\" due today linked to the Acme Software License deal, \"Schedule onboarding call\" due tomorrow, and \"Prepare Q3 Review\" due next week\n\n4. **People section (right column, top):**\n   - \"People\" heading\n   - Three people with avatars: Sarah Johnson (CEO), Michael Chen (CTO), and Emily Davis (Project Manager)\n\n5. **Deals section (left column):**\n   - \"Deals\" heading\n   - Two deals: \"Acme Software License\" at the Proposal Sent stage valued at $50,000, and \"Additional Services\" in Qualification valued at $10,000\n\n6. **Timeline section (right column, bottom):**\n   - \"Timeline\" heading with entries below showing activity history: today's task creation, yesterday's client note about new features, the deal stage change from two days ago, a meeting confirmation email sent last week, and a contact addition from last month\n\n7. **Attachments section:**\n   - \"Attachments\" heading with a table showing files like Service Agreement.pdf, including metadata like creation date and linked deals\n\n, plus download and delete actions for each attachment\n\nNow I'm mapping out the component structure for this client detail page: I'll need separate components for the header with client info and badges, quick action buttons for adding tasks and deals, source information display, and then distinct sections for tasks, deals, attachments, and people lists.\n\nI'm also adding a timeline feed to show activity history. With all these components identified, I'll create a tracking system and work through building each one systematically.","signature":"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

Each link has an icon to its left. The sidebar also displays the app logo/title at the top.\n\n#### Clicking Clients link navigates to /clients\n- **Initial state:** User is on any page other than Clients.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Clients\" link in the sidebar.\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /clients, the ClientsListPage is displayed, and the \"Clients\" link in the sidebar is visually highlighted as the active link.\n\n#### Clicking Contacts link navigates to /contacts\n- **Initial state:** User is on any page other than Contacts.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Contacts\" link in the sidebar.\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /contacts, the ContactsListPage is displayed, and the \"Contacts\" link in the sidebar is visually highlighted as the active link.\n\n#### Clicking Deals link navigates to /deals\n- **Initial state:** User is on any page other than Deals.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Deals\" link in the sidebar.\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /deals, the DealsListPage is displayed, and the \"Deals\" link in the sidebar is visually highlighted as the active link.\n\n#### Clicking Tasks link navigates to /tasks\n- **Initial state:** User is on any page other than Tasks.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Tasks\" link in the sidebar.\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /tasks, the TasksListPage is displayed, and the \"Tasks\" link in the sidebar is visually highlighted as the active link.\n\n#### Clicking Team link navigates to /users\n- **Initial state:** User is on any page other than Team.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Team\" link in the sidebar.\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /users, the UsersListPage is displayed, and the \"Team\" link in the sidebar is visually highlighted as the active link.\n\n#### Clicking Settings link navigates to /settings\n- **Initial state:** User is on any page other than Settings.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Settings\" link in the sidebar.\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /settings, the SettingsPage is displayed, and the \"Settings\" link in the sidebar is visually highlighted as the active link.\n\n#### Active link highlights based on current route\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /clients directly via URL.\n- **Expected:** The \"Clients\" link in the sidebar has a highlighted/active background style (e.g., darker background) distinguishing it from the other non-active links. Other links have the default transparent background.\n\n#### Active link updates on sub-routes\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /clients/123 (a client detail page).\n- **Expected:** The \"Clients\" link in the sidebar is highlighted as the active link, since the route is a sub-route of /clients.\n\n#### Sidebar is persistent across all pages\n- **Initial state:** User navigates between different pages (Clients, Deals, Tasks, etc.).\n- **Expected:** The sidebar remains visible and in the same position on every page. The sidebar width is consistent (approximately 244px).

The form remains visible so the user can retry.\n\n#### Error message displayed on network failure\n- **Initial state:** The reset password form is displayed.\n- **Action:** User enters matching passwords and clicks \"Reset Password\", but a network error occurs.\n- **Expected:** An error message \"Network error\" is displayed below the inputs. The form remains visible so the user can retry.\n\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n\nComponents: ConfirmEmailPage\n\n### ConfirmEmailPage\n\n#### Loading state displayed while confirming email with token\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=somevalidtoken. The API request to confirm the email is in progress.\n- **Expected:** The page displays a loading message \"Confirming your email...\" in muted text while the confirmation request is being processed.\n\n#### Successful confirmation shows success message and redirects to /clients\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=somevalidtoken.\n- **Expected:** After the API returns a successful response, the loading message is replaced by a success message \"Email confirmed! Redirecting...\" in primary text. After a brief delay (approximately 2 seconds), the browser automatically navigates to /clients, displaying the ClientsListPage.\n\n#### Missing token shows error message\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email without a token query parameter (no ?token=...).\n- **Expected:** The page immediately displays an error message \"No confirmation token provided\" in red text. No API request is made. The page does not redirect.\n\n#### Invalid or expired token shows error message\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=invalidtoken where the token does not exist, has already been used, or has expired.\n- **Expected:** After the API returns an error response, the page displays an error message \"Invalid or expired token\" in red text. The page does not redirect.\n\n#### Network error shows error message\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=sometoken but a network error occurs during the API request.\n- **Expected:** The page displays an error message \"Network error\" in red text. The page does not redirect.\n\n#### Auto-login after successful confirmation stores auth token\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=somevalidtoken and the API returns a successful response that includes an auth token.\n- **Expected:** The auth token from the response is stored in localStorage. The user is automatically logged in — after redirecting to /clients, the sidebar user area shows the user's avatar, display name, and sign-out button instead of the \"Sign In\" button.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":739,"oldLines":6,"newStart":739,"newLines":74,"lines":[" "," ### ClientAttachments"," ","+#### Attachments section displays heading","+- **Initial state:** ClientDetailPage is loaded for a client with attachments.","+- **Expected:** The Attachments section displays an \"Attachments\" heading.","+","+#### Attachments section displays list of attachments","+- **Initial state:** ClientDetailPage is loaded for a client with three attachments: \"Service Agreement.pdf\" (Document, 2023-02-01, linked to Acme Software License deal), \"Project Scope.docx\" (Document, 2023-02-10, no linked deal), \"Client Website Link\" (Link, 2023-01-15, no linked deal).","+- **Expected:** The Attachments section lists all three attachments in a table-like layout.

Redirecting...\" in primary text. After a brief delay (approximately 2 seconds), the browser automatically navigates to /clients, displaying the ClientsListPage.\n\n#### Missing token shows error message\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email without a token query parameter (no ?token=...).\n- **Expected:** The page immediately displays an error message \"No confirmation token provided\" in red text. No API request is made. The page does not redirect.\n\n#### Invalid or expired token shows error message\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=invalidtoken where the token does not exist, has already been used, or has expired.\n- **Expected:** After the API returns an error response, the page displays an error message \"Invalid or expired token\" in red text. The page does not redirect.\n\n#### Network error shows error message\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=sometoken but a network error occurs during the API request.\n- **Expected:** The page displays an error message \"Network error\" in red text. The page does not redirect.\n\n#### Auto-login after successful confirmation stores auth token\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /auth/confirm-email?token=somevalidtoken and the API returns a successful response that includes an auth token.\n- **Expected:** The auth token from the response is stored in localStorage.
