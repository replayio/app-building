No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits.

Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files.

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it.

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

There are no dedicated test files for ConfirmEmailPage. Let me also check the auth backend to understand the confirm-email action, and let me read the AppRevisions.md to see if there are relevant changes.\n\nLet me now systematically go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecConfirmEmailPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in ConfirmEmailPage test entries\n\nI need to check the test entries in docs/tests.md (lines 2454-2479) against the directives in testSpec.md.\n\nLet me list the test entries:\n1. \"Valid token confirms email and auto-logs in\"\n\n\n2. \"Loading state is displayed during token verification\"\n3. \"Invalid token shows error message\"\n4. \"Expired token shows error message\"\n5. \"Already-used token shows error message\"\n6. \"Missing token shows error message\"\n7. \"Error state shows link to sign in\"\n\nNow I'm checking each testSpec.md directive against these entries to identify any violations.\n\nThe ConfirmEmailPage is straightforward with just loading, success, and error states plus a navigation link, so my test entries appear to cover all visible elements. The clickable elements are properly specified with their navigation targets — the error state link goes to /clients where users can access the sign-in form, and the valid token flow redirects to /clients after auto-logging in.\n\nFor data mutations, the confirm email action is tested through the \"Valid token confirms email and auto-logs in\" entry, which verifies the primary effect and side effects like login and redirect. The \"Already-used token shows error message\" test indirectly confirms that tokens are marked as used. Now I'm checking whether button and control appearance — specific text, icons, and styling — are properly captured in the test entries. The valid token test expects the sidebar to update with the user's avatar, name, and sign-out button after the redirect, which properly verifies cross-app state changes. The ConfirmEmailPage test entries look solid overall without obvious violations.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the component code actually satisfies each test entry requirement from the spec. satisfied:\n   - \"Valid token confirms email and auto-logs in\" - The code handles this with the fetch to auth endpoint, login(), and navigate(\"/clients\"). ✓\n   - \"Loading state is displayed during token verification\" - Shows \"Confirming your email...\" during loading. ✓\n   - \"Invalid token shows error message\" - Error state shows the error message from the API. ✓ \n   - \"Expired token shows error message\" - Error state shows the error message from the API. ✓\n   - \"Already-used token shows error message\" - Error state shows the error message from the API. ✓\n   - \"Missing token shows error message\" - Shows \"No confirmation token provided.\" ✓\n   - \"Error state shows link to sign in\" - Shows \"Go to Sign In\" button that navigates to \"/clients\". ✓\n\n3. **Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup.**\n   - No mockup available to reference, so I'm relying on the test entries to guide the styling.\n\n4. **All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything that E2E tests will need to target.**\n   - I've added the necessary test IDs: `confirm-email-page`, `confirm-email-handler`, `confirm-email-loading`, `confirm-email-success`, `confirm-email-error`, and `confirm-email-signin-link`. All set.\n\n5. **In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory, add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` to `netlify.toml`.**\n   - This doesn't apply to the component itself.\n\n6. **When using the neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax for queries.**\n   - Not relevant since this is frontend-only.\n\n7. **For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null before inserting or updating.**\n   - Not applicable here.\n\n8. **Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3.**\n   - Not directly relevant.\n\n9. **When building modals that reference other entities, use a searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.**\n   - No modals in this component.\n\n10. **\n\nNavigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL.**\n    - No sidebar or menu present.\n\n11. **Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns.**\n    - No dropdowns here.\n\n12. **Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails.**\n    - Not applicable.\n\n13. **Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.**\n    - Not applicable.\n\n14. **Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`).**\n    - The ConfirmEmailPage has `className=\"auth-page\"`, so I need to verify whether `auth-page` already includes the required padding or if explicit padding needs to be

The `query` and `queryOne` functions in `@shared/backend/db.ts` use `sql(text, params)` - the parameterized query style. But the writeApp.md directive says:\n\n> When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n\nThe shared db.ts helper is using exactly the pattern the directive forbids: `sql(text, params)`. This is a violation, but it's in the shared backend code, not specific to ConfirmEmailPage. \n\nHowever, since auth.ts uses these helpers and ConfirmEmailPage depends on auth.ts, there's an indirect violation chain. But I need to focus on my actual subtask - checking for directive violations specifically within the ConfirmEmailPage components themselves, which include ConfirmEmailPage.tsx and the ConfirmEmail component.\n\nThe backend auth.ts function is shared across all auth flows, so that's a separate concern covered by the CheckBackend task. I should concentrate on the frontend components.\n\nLooking at ConfirmEmailPage.tsx, it's a simple wrapper with proper styling and test attributes. Now I need to verify ConfirmEmailHandler.tsx against all the writeApp.md directives - checking that interactive elements have data-testid attributes, padding is correctly applied, and other requirements are met.\n\nThe component appears clean from a directive standpoint. The auth-page class handles the padding requirement with CSS (24px base, 12px on mobile) rather than Tailwind classes, which achieves the same effect as the p-6 max-sm:p-3 pattern.\n\nFor the test file check, there are no Playwright tests specifically for ConfirmEmailPage despite seven test scenarios being documented in the tests.md file. I need to determine whether this absence itself constitutes a violation of the writeTests.md directive that requires tests to be written for documented test entries.\n\nLooking at the writeTests.md directive more carefully, it specifies that auth flows involving email verification must have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path without the IS_TEST bypass—meaning they need to call the actual signup endpoint, query the database for the generated token, and verify the confirmation endpoint works with that token. Since no such tests exist for ConfirmEmailPage, this is a directive violation that should be flagged.","signature":"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

Let me systematically go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecConfirmEmailPage\n\nThe test entries in docs/tests.md (lines 2454-2479) for ConfirmEmailPage:\n\n1. \"Valid token confirms email and auto-logs in\"\n2. \"Loading state is displayed during token verification\"\n3. \"Invalid token shows error message\"\n4. \"Expired token shows error message\"\n5. \"Already-used token shows error message\"\n6. \"Missing token shows error message\"\n7. \"Error state shows link to sign in\"\n\nNow checking against testSpec.md directives:\n\n\nThe ConfirmEmailPage contains a loading spinner, success message, error messages, and a sign-in link—all covered by the test entries. The entries faithfully describe expected behavior without substituting easier implementations, and they specify exact navigation targets like redirecting to /clients for both valid tokens and error states.\n\nFor data mutations, the \"Valid token\" entry traces the full chain from token verification through email confirmation and login to the final redirect, though I should verify the token gets marked as used—which the \"Already-used token\" entry implicitly covers. The specific UI text like \"Email confirmed! Redirecting...\" and \"This confirmation link is invalid...\" are accounted for in the entries.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test spec properly validates cross-app state changes. The \"Valid token\" entry confirms the sidebar updates with the user's avatar, name, and sign-out button after the redirect, which is solid verification that state propagates across the application. I don't see clear gaps in the test spec entries themselves.\n\nMoving to the ConfirmEmailPage components—the page itself and its handler component. Checking against the writeApp.md directives, the test entries cover the key scenarios: valid tokens confirming email and auto-logging in, loading states during verification, and I'm now verifying that the code actually implements these behaviors. The test IDs are all in place across loading, success, and error states plus the sign-in link. The remaining checklist items don't apply to this frontend component—the Neon template literals and null conversions are backend concerns, and there's no monorepo or mockup to validate against. Looking at the test directives from writeTests.md against ConfirmEmailPage, there are no dedicated test files for this component despite seven test scenarios being documented, so none of the testing requirements can be verified.\n\nThe critical gap is directive 13: the confirm email flow needs a dedicated test that runs the actual backend without test bypasses, calls the signup endpoint, queries the database for the generated token, then hits the confirmation endpoint with that token to verify the full production path works.\n\nLooking at the existing tests, the sidebar tests use IS_TEST=true for auto-confirmation, and there's no equivalent to the password reset test that exercises the real confirm-email flow with database token querying. This is a violation of the writeTests.md requirements for email-based auth flows.\n\nLet me check if the skill document is asking me to identify violations in existing tests or ensure tests are written.","signature":"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

The reset-password tests DO follow the directive about exercising real production code paths (the \"Submit with matching passwords succeeds and auto-logs in\" test queries the DB directly for the token). But there are NO equivalent tests for the confirm-email flow.\n\nThe writeTests.md directive states:\n> Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass. These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint, query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint with that token and verify success.\n \nThe confirm-email flow is exactly an \"auth flow that involves email-based verification,\" so it needs a dedicated test that calls signup without IS_TEST, retrieves the real token from the database, and verifies the confirmation endpoint works with that token. Since ConfirmEmailPage has no tests at all, this is a clear violation of the directive.\n\nI should flag this as a violation that needs fixing. With no existing test files to check against the other directives like `getByText` usage or `.toPass()` patterns, the missing test is the only violation I can report. Let me also see if the deployment spec includes any auth tests that might partially address this.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3673,"cache_read_input_tokens":59083,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3673,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":12,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"af0c4a1a-599a-4144-9b92-535c5642cea7","uuid":"b7da7fe2-5bb6-4d1d-80e5-ee56e3e47f23"}

It does NOT exercise the actual confirm-email flow (navigating to /auth/confirm-email with a token).\n\nSo my findings for Subtask 3:\n\nThere are **no dedicated test files** for the ConfirmEmailPage test entries. The 7 test entries in docs/tests.md have no corresponding playwright tests. Moreover, the writeTests.md directive specifically requires:\n\n> Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n\nThis is a clear violation. A confirm-email test spec file should exist with tests that:\n\n\n- Call the signup endpoint without IS_TEST=true, query the database for the generated confirmation token, navigate to /auth/confirm-email with that real token, and verify the email gets confirmed with the user logged in and redirected. I need to create a fix task that includes writing the confirm-email.spec.ts file with all 7 test entries and running them to verify they pass.\n\nLooking at this more carefully, the real gap is that while the 7 test entries from the docs cover the standard scenarios (loading state, invalid token, expired token, used token, missing token, error state), I also need a dedicated test for the actual production code path that exercises the full flow end-to-end without the IS_TEST bypass—similar to how reset-password.spec.ts handles it. So the violations are both missing tests for all 7 documented entries and missing that real auth flow test.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1491,"cache_read_input_tokens":62756,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1491,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"af0c4a1a-599a-4144-9b92-535c5642cea7","uuid":"e8666f55-c8db-4a46-8bbc-1c5d683e1e29"}
