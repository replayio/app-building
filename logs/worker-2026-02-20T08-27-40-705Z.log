No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data.

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs).

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it contains subsequent changes to the spec from bug reports and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings.

This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":116,"startLine":1,"totalLines":116}}}

[2026-02-20T08:23:21.792Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01VrvC7KjjcVmMM219wN837o","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have all the information I need. Let me set up my todo list and start working through the three jobs systematically.\n\nThe three jobs are:\n1. CheckTestSpecDealDetailPage: Check testSpec.md directive violations in DealDetailPage test entries\n2. CheckComponentsDealDetailPage: Check writeApp.md directive violations in DealDetailPage components\n3. CheckTestsDealDetailPage: Check writeTests.md directive violations in DealDetailPage tests\n\nLet me start with Job 1 - checking the DealDetailPage test entries in docs/tests.md against testSpec.md directives.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n\n- Ensure visual consistency across all page mockups, especially styling and navigation\n- Inventory every visible element systematically—headers, filters, buttons, icons, badges, sections—and write a test for each\n- Don't swap in simpler elements; test what the mockup actually shows\n- For clickable elements, specify the exact navigation target or action result\n- For data mutations, verify the change persists and all side effects occur (like history entries, one per action)\n- Button and control appearance matters—test the specific styling shown in the mockup\n- Modal dialogs need thorough testing\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise\n- Import/upload dialogs must document expected data formats visibly\n- Configurable backend integrations need complete setup instructions visible in the UI\n- State-changing actions must trigger appropriate updates elsewhere in the app\n\nNow I'm reviewing the DealDetailPage test entries against these criteria, starting with the component breakdown at line 804 to see how thoroughly each section—DealHeader, StagePipeline, DealHistorySection, DealMetricsSection, WriteupsSection, and Linked components—is covered.\n\nContinuing through the test entries, I see coverage for Breadcrumb, DealHeader, StagePipeline, DealHistorySection, DealMetricsSection, WriteupsSection, LinkedTasksSection, and AttachmentsSection, with test IDs ranging from DDP-BRC-01 through DDP-ATT entries.\n\nNow I'm checking the directives against these test cases. For consistent styling, I'd need to see the mockup, but I notice the Breadcrumb tests don't cover sidebar navigation patterns that are tested elsewhere. Looking at inventory coverage, DealHeader elements like title, client, value, owner, stage dropdown, and change stage button are all accounted for, along with StagePipeline stages and progress indicators, DealHistorySection's stage change log, DealMetricsSection's probability and expected close metrics, and WriteupsSection's title, author, date, content, edit, and version history features.\n\nThe remaining sections—LinkedTasksSection with checkboxes, names, due dates, task creation and completion; AttachmentsSection with filename, size, download, delete, and upload functionality; and ContactsSection with avatar, name, role, company, and profile viewing—all appear to have test coverage. For the clickable elements directive, I'm verifying that navigation targets are specified: \"Deals\" navigates to /deals, the edit client field saves changes, the change stage button specifies results, and clicking a linked task navigates to the task detail page.\n\nNow I'm checking the mutations directive more carefully. Stage changes create both deal history and client timeline entries, task creation triggers timeline entries on both deal and client, task completion creates a timeline entry, and writeup edits generate version history. But I'm noticing that editing the client field and value field only mention \"Change persisted\" without any indication of timeline or history entries being created—that's a gap I need to flag. The directive is clear—any data mutation needs tests verifying both that the change persists and that the right side effects happen, like history or timeline entries being created without duplicates. And state-changing actions must trigger appropriate updates elsewhere in the app. So for the deal detail page mutations like editing client fields, values, and metrics, my test entries should explicitly confirm whether timeline or history entries are expected, rather than just saying \"Change persisted\" and leaving it ambiguous.\n\nNow I'm checking the cross-entity updates—attachments appearing in the client's section and tasks showing up in the client's task list both look good. For button appearance, I see the edit and version history icons are specified, the upload icon is there, and the stage change button is visible, but the Add Task button doesn't mention its icon or styling. And I'm still working through the modal dialog tests to make sure they're complete.\n\nI'm noticing some gaps in the modal testing—the writeup creation modal mentions Save and Cancel buttons, but there's no actual test confirming the Cancel button closes without saving. Also, the attachment upload tests only cover the Link URL mode, not the actual file upload functionality. Given Directive 8 requires file upload support, I need to make sure that's being tested too. Looking at directive 11 on state-changing actions, I'm checking whether updates in one section properly cascade to related areas. DDP-HDR-04 and DDP-LTK-03 and DDP-ATT-03 all verify these connections work, but there are gaps—changing the client field doesn't test if the old client's deals section updates, editing the deal value doesn't confirm the client page reflects it, and completing a task doesn't verify the update propagates to both the client page and tasks list page.\n\nThe cross-cutting tests like DATA-02 and DATA-05 do cover some of these cross-page effects, so DDP-LTK-04 at least should clarify where the timeline entry appears. I'm also noticing there's no test for deleting a writeup, even though there are tests for viewing and creating them.\n\nThere's a gap for modal cancel buttons too—Directive 7 requires complete modal testing, and that should include cancellation. Similarly, I don't see tests for adding or removing contacts from a deal, and the LinkedTasksSection is missing a delete task test entirely.\n\nLooking at the violations against the testSpec directives, I'm seeing several gaps: no file upload test for attachments beyond the URL linking mode, missing cancel button tests across multiple modals, no delete test for writeups despite having create and edit coverage, and incomplete contact and task management tests.\n\nI'm also noticing that the mutation tests only verify data persistence without checking side effects like history entries or timeline updates. For instance, DDP-LTK-04 doesn't clarify where the timeline entry gets created when a task is completed. Let me examine the component descriptions more carefully to understand what functionality should actually be tested—the DealHeader covers editable fields and stage management, while the ContactsSection handles contact information and interactions. \"View Profile\" link\n\nSo ContactsSection only has a \"View Profile\" link - no add/remove. But should there be? The testSpec directive says \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\" and \"Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons).\" If the mockup doesn't show add/remove, then maybe it's OK. But from a functional standpoint, not being able to add contacts to a deal seems incomplete.\n\nActually, let me not over-think this. Let me focus on clear, definite violations of the directives.\n\nClear violations:\n1. **No file upload test for deal attachments** - DDP-ATT-03 only tests Link URL. Violates \"Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\"\n2. **Incomplete modal testing** - No cancel tests for writeup/task/attachment modals. Violates \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\"\n3. **No test for adding contacts/individuals to a deal** - The component has a ContactsSection but no mechanism to add contacts is tested. If the section has any way to add contacts (and from the spec it seems like there should be), there should be a test for it.\n\nLooking back at the ContactsSection description more carefully - it just lists \"Contacts/Individuals\" heading with avatar, name, role, company, and \"View Profile\" link. No \"Add Contact\" button is mentioned. The DealHeader doesn't mention adding contacts either, so maybe contacts are linked through other means when creating a deal. Without the actual mockup, I can't definitively say this is a violation.\n\nLet me move forward and check the DealDetailPage components and tests

Now I can see:\n1. WriteupsSection: Has no delete button for writeups - so no violation for missing delete test. The UI only has edit and version history buttons.\n2.

DealAttachmentsSection: Has upload button, download links, and delete buttons.\n\nSo the WriteupsSection has no delete functionality in the code, so no test entry needed for that. And DealContactsSection has no add functionality, so no test entry needed for that either.\n\nLet me now check the UploadAttachmentModal to see if it supports actual file uploads.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5490,"cache_read_input_tokens":63775,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5490,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"049ee454-6127-4869-8468-387e0318bd99","uuid":"ffd407dc-20a0-45b1-ba57-2866c397bdac"}

Let me summarize my findings for Job 1.\n\nLooking at the actual UI components:\n- WriteupsSection: No delete button exists in the code. So no missing delete test.\n- DealContactsSection: No add/remove contact button exists. So no missing add/remove test.\n- All modals (AddWriteupModal, AddDealTaskModal, UploadAttachmentModal) have Cancel buttons.\n- UploadAttachmentModal: Has both File Upload and Link URL modes. The File Upload mode uses `URL.createObjectURL(file)` - it creates a blob URL, NOT actual UploadThing upload. \n\nThe attachment issue is actually a testSpec problem, not a writeApp directive issue. The DDP-ATT-03 test only covers the Link URL mode, leaving the File Upload mode untested despite the component supporting it.\n\nLooking back at the modal testing directive more carefully—\"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\"—this means I need to verify that each modal handles opening, filling, saving, and canceling. The current test coverage is incomplete on the cancel path for these modals. me check if any DealDetailPage modals have cancel tests:- AddWriteupModal: DDP-WRT-02 opens it, DDP-WRT-03 creates. No cancel test. **VIOLATION**\n- AddDealTaskModal: DDP-LTK-02 opens it, DDP-LTK-03 creates. No cancel test. **VIOLATION**\n- UploadAttachmentModal: DDP-ATT-02 opens it, DDP-ATT-03 tests link URL mode. No cancel test. **VIOLATION**\n- VersionHistoryModal: DDP-WRT-06 shows versions. No cancel/close test (but this is a display-only modal so maybe that's OK).\n\nActually, for modals that have Cancel buttons, there should be tests verifying that Cancel closes the modal without saving. This is a clear requirement. Looking at the DealsListPage pattern, DLP-HDR-06 explicitly tests that the Create Deal modal's Cancel button closes without creating anything, so DealDetailPage modals should follow the same pattern but they're missing those tests.\n\nSo my findings for Job 1 are: DealDetailPage is missing a file upload test for attachments—DDP-ATT-03 only covers Link URL mode and doesn't exercise the actual file picker—and it's missing cancel button tests for all the modals that have them, which violates the directive to completely test that modal dialogs work properly. I'm noticing that the test entries for editing client and value fields don't explicitly verify whether deal history entries should be created—they just confirm persistence. The directive requires documenting side effects, but since Deal History is specifically defined as tracking stage changes, the absence of history entries might be intentional. I'll flag this as a minor concern rather than a clear violation, then move forward to examine the remaining component and test files for Jobs 2 and 3.","signature":"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

The directive explicitly states components shouldn't include outer padding or margins on their root elements — the parent layout should control that. Looking back at the components, several have padding classes on their root elements that should probably be removed to follow this principle. I'm noticing the `mb-4` margin on section components is technically a violation of the layout-agnostic principle, but it's a systemic pattern across the entire app rather than specific to DealDetailPage, so fixing it would require touching every component.

Any UI that allows adding attachments must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\"\n \nThe UploadAttachmentModal on DealDetailPage has a file picker, but it's creating blob URLs instead of actually uploading to UploadThing — so while the UI mechanism works, the files aren't persisted. This is a systemic issue across both the client-detail and deal-detail modals, though I'm focusing on DealDetailPage for this check.\n\nThe writeApp.md directive emphasizes having a working file picker rather than just URL entry, which DealDetailPage does have. But since blob URLs don't survive page reloads, the feature is effectively broken, which violates the requirement for clean, fully functional code backed by the database.\n\nNow I'm checking the test file against the writeTests.md directives to see what needs to be verified — things like precise navigation assertions, proper side effect testing, avoiding generic text selectors, consistent test IDs, and actual file upload mechanics.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":460,"cache_read_input_tokens":110705,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":460,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"049ee454-6127-4869-8468-387e0318bd99","uuid":"895e687e-005c-439d-9ea5-fe5903d41786"}
