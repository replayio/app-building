Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly.

Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7aa191fd-450d-43ea-a281-1a2c7999f9c9","uuid":"8c7b7ad9-bda0-4618-81b0-2a16ce1b41d0","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly.

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true).

See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    12→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    13→  the work currently being done.\n    14→\n    15→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    16→external services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n    17→\n    18→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    19→\n    20→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n    21→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    22→2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n    23→3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    24→   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    25→\n    26→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    27→matching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    28→\n    29→## Worker Execution\n    30→\n    31→The worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\n    32→it passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    33→\n    34→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    36→\n    37→The worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\n    38→jobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    39→\n    40→When you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    41→\n    42→## Job System\n    43→\n    44→Work is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\n    45→with a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\n    46→and a `timestamp`:\n    47→\n    48→```json\n    49→{\n    50→  \"groups\": [\n    51→    {\n    52→      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    53→      \"jobs\": [\n    54→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    55→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    57→      ],\n    58→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    59→    }\n    60→  ]\n    61→}\n    62→```\n    63→\n    64→The agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n    65→\n    66→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n    67→  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n    68→  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n    69→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    70→\n    71→All jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\n    72→all checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\n    73→sub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    74→\n    75→**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n    76→\n    77→- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    78→  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    79→- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n    80→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    81→- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n    82→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    83→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n    84→- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n    85→\n    86→## Tech Stack\n    87→\n    88→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    89→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    90→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    91→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    92→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    93→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    94→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`.

The email and password fields remain visible.\n\n#### Sign Up form submits and requires email confirmation\n- **Initial state:** The inline auth form is open in Sign Up mode.\n- **Action:** User enters a new email and password and clicks the \"Sign Up\" submit button.\n- **Expected:** The form submits the registration. A message is displayed informing the user that a confirmation email has been sent and they must confirm their email before logging in. The user is not yet authenticated. (In test mode with IS_TEST=true, signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.)\n\n#### Logged in state shows avatar, name, and sign-out\n- **Initial state:** User is authenticated with an active session.\n- **Expected:** The sidebar user area displays the user's avatar (or initials), the user's display name, and a sign-out button or icon. The \"Sign In\" button is not visible.\n\n#### Clicking sign-out logs the user out\n- **Initial state:** User is authenticated. The sidebar shows avatar, name, and sign-out.\n- **Action:** User clicks the sign-out button.\n- **Expected:** The user's session is ended. The sidebar user area reverts to showing the \"Sign In\" button. The avatar and name are no longer displayed. The app continues to function in unauthenticated mode (all pages remain accessible).\n\n## ClientsListPage (/clients)\n\n## ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n\n## PersonDetailPage (/individuals/:individualId)\n\n## DealsListPage (/deals)\n\n## DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)\n\n## TasksListPage (/tasks)\n\n## TaskDetailPage (/tasks/:taskId)\n\n## ContactsListPage (/contacts)\n\n## SettingsPage (/settings)\n\n## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n\n## UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n\n## ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n\n## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n","numLines":122,"startLine":1,"totalLines":122}}}

The outer container (`.ezxFuW`) is a single-column grid where each child is a full-width row.\n\n```css\n/* Outer list container */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* single column, full-width rows */\ngrid-template-rows: 36px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 308px;\n                  /* ^group header  ^issue rows...                              ^spacer */\n```\n\n- **Group header row**: 36px tall\n- **Issue row**: 44px tall\n- The list container has 14 children: 1 group header + 12 issue rows + 1 spacer\n\n### Issue Row Structure\n\nEach issue row is an `<a>` tag (the full row is clickable) wrapping an inner grid `<div>` with **7 named grid columns**:\n\n| Column       | Content Example          | Font Size | Font Weight | Color             |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `checkbox`   | (empty/checkbox)         | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `priority`   | (priority icon)          | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `identifier` | \"PRO-1247\", \"TT-38\"     | 13px      | 450         | rgb(91, 91, 93)   |\n| `status`     | (status icon)            | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `title`      | \"Contact form not working\" | 13px    | 500         | rgb(26, 26, 26)   |\n| `created`    | (date/avatar info)       | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n| (additional) | (assignee, labels, etc.) | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n\nKey observations:\n- **Identifier** uses muted color `rgb(91, 91, 93)` / `#5b5b5d` with semi-bold weight 450\n- **Title** uses primary color `rgb(26, 26, 26)` / `#1a1a1a` with medium weight 500\n- Both use 13px font size (not the body 16px)\n- The grid uses **named column tracks** (`checkbox`, `priority`, `identifier`, `status`, `title`, `created`) for semantic column placement\n\n### Issue Row Styling\n\n```css\n/* Issue row (A tag) */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-column: 1 / -1;      /* spans full width */\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 44px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nborder: none;              /* 0px none — no visible row borders */\ncursor: default;\ntext-decoration: none;     /* no underline on the link */\noutline: none;             /* focus-visible override */\n```\n\n### Row Separation\n\nRows have **no visible borders** between them. Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nfont-size: 16px;\nfont-weight: 400;\n```\n\nGroup headers contain section names (e.g., \"Other active\") with a count badge (\"19\").\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —         |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`  | ~6% black |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(239, 239, 239)`     | `#efefef` |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(245, 245, 245)`     | `#f5f5f5` |\n| Alt hover (mid)   | `rgb(247, 247, 247)`     | `#f7f7f7` |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(237, 237, 237)`     | `#ededed` |\n\nAll hover backgrounds observed in stylesheets:\n- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)` — primary interactive hover\n- `rgb(239, 239, 239)` — pressed/active\n- `rgb(245, 245, 245)` — sidebar hover\n- `rgb(247, 247, 247)` — light hover\n- `rgb(237, 237, 237)` — selected state\n- `transparent` — reset/clear hover\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: var(--control-border-radius, 4px);\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(45, 46, 47);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background         | Description                |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Default | transparent        | No background              |\n| Hover   | rgb(247, 247, 247) | `#f7f7f7` — subtle gray    |\n| Active  | rgb(238, 238, 238) | `#eeeeee` — slightly darker|\n\nThe hover transition uses `var(--speed-highlightFadeIn)` for a fast, smooth appearance.\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n| `1px solid var(--gray4)`             | Subtle separators        |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#dcdcdc`.\nHover border uses `var(--normal-border-hover)` and `var(--gray5)` for a slightly darker state.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value                              | Usage                     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| `var(--control-border-radius)` 4px | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px                                | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px                                | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%                                | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows are very subtle and use low-opacity black.

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links.

FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match.

Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7aa191fd-450d-43ea-a281-1a2c7999f9c9","uuid":"14399f92-334e-4b42-acae-3b445e46e4dd","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

Looking at the existing components:\n\n1. **SidebarNavLinks.tsx** - Already fully implemented with all 6 navigation links, icons, active state detection, proper data-testid attributes\n2. **SidebarUserArea.tsx** - Already fully implemented with sign-in/sign-up forms, auth state management, forgot password link, etc.\n3. **Sidebar.tsx** - Already fully implemented with the sidebar layout, title, user area, and nav links\n\nLet me also check the auth slice to make sure it's complete, and the store configuration.\n\nWait - these files already look complete and match all the test specs. \n\nI'm reviewing the job descriptions against what's actually been implemented, and it seems the SetupApp job already completed all three sidebar components with proper test attributes and functionality, so I need to verify whether these still need work or if the layout integration is what's missing. Sign In form submits with email and password, forgot password link works, and toggling between Sign In and Sign Up modes functions correctly. Sign Up requires email confirmation, and the logged-in state displays the user's avatar and name with a working sign-out option. The sidebar has the correct title, user area, navigation links, dimensions, and styling, while the app layout properly combines the sidebar with main content using flexbox and routes everything correctly with a redirect to the clients page.\n\nNow I'm double-checking that all the form fields are present—the name input in sign-up is there, the confirmation message displays after signup, and auth errors show properly. Let me verify the auth slice has all the necessary thunks and review the component implementations against the original requirements.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":10386,"cache_read_input_tokens":36265,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":10386,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7aa191fd-450d-43ea-a281-1a2c7999f9c9","uuid":"e4b14607-15c7-4c32-bd5e-0fc332e3cfa5"}

Now let me run a type check to ensure everything compiles correctly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3369,"cache_read_input_tokens":46651,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3369,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7aa191fd-450d-43ea-a281-1a2c7999f9c9","uuid":"2337b8ba-6885-4668-abb6-e8450d66d4da"}
