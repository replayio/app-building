A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load.

Now I need to systematically check for directive violations. Let me organize my work:\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecRecipesPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in RecipesPage test entries\n\nI need to check all RecipesPage test entries in docs/tests.md against the testSpec.md directives.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images of different pages might not have consistent styling/navigation - prioritize consistency\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup - write test entry for each one\n3. Don't substitute easier-to-implement elements for what mockup shows\n\n\n4. For every clickable element, test entry must specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. For user actions that mutate data, write test entries verifying change is persisted + side effects\n6. Button and control appearance matters - verify appearance\n7. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions visible in config UI\n11. State-changing actions must test that other parts update appropriately\n\nNow I'm going to examine the RecipesPage test entries in tests.md to see which directives they're violating.\n\nLooking at the test coverage, I can see the page has RecipesHeader with title and search/filter controls, a RecipesTable with columns including a version indicator, and a RecipeDetailsPanel with tabs for different recipe information. The entries cover most visible elements like the add recipe button, table rows, and detail tabs, but I need to verify we're actually testing all the computed columns and that clickable elements specify their exact targets rather than just saying they're clickable.\n\nFor the interactions, I'm checking that each button and link goes to the right place—the add button opens a modal with specific fields, edit opens a pre-filled modal, delete shows a confirmation, row clicks open the details panel, pagination navigates correctly, and tab clicks show the right content. I'm also verifying that data changes actually persist when navigating away, which both the add and edit recipes tests cover.\n\nNow I'm looking at the visual elements—the add button is blue, the edit icon is a pencil, the delete icon is red, and status badges have their specific colors. For the modals, I've confirmed the add recipe modal has all its fields and works correctly, the edit modal pre-fills and saves changes, and the delete confirmation has both confirm and cancel paths.\n\nThe delete confirmation behavior persists correctly when navigating away. For state-changing actions, there's no timeline or history feature to test, and recipes don't have symmetrical relationships. Let me verify these test entries against the actual directives in the spec rather than just the mockup images to catch any gaps.\n\nLooking at the clickable elements more carefully, I need to confirm each one has a specified navigation target or action result: the search filters are tested, the status dropdown shows its options and filtering behavior, the Add Recipe button triggers the modal with the full creation flow, the Edit button opens the modal for modifications, and the Delete button shows a confirmation dialog. This covers the directive requirement for clickable element testing.\n\nNow I'm checking whether there are any other directives that apply to the RecipesPage—import/upload dialogs, backend configuration, and file attachments don't seem relevant here. Let me review the AppSpec to see if there's anything in the actual specification that the test entries might be missing.\n\nLooking at the Add Recipe modal more closely, I need to verify whether the Product field should be a dropdown or text input, since the directive about searchable selects for entity relationships might affect how the test should specify this interaction. But actually, that's a writeApp.md concern, not a testSpec.md one. For the test spec, the key requirement is that every clickable element specifies its exact navigation target or action result, which the current entries seem to cover. Let me go through the directives systematically to make sure nothing's been overlooked.\n\nThe design consistency guideline doesn't really apply to test entries themselves. For the inventory of visible elements, I'm checking off the page title, search bar, status filter, Add Recipe button, table columns, status badges, action icons, pagination, and the details panel with its tabs and content sections. That seems thorough, but I'm noticing there's no test entry for closing the details panel—if there's a close button, that interaction should be documented.\n\nLooking at REC-PNL-6, the test for displaying general information feels vague. It mentions recipe name, product, version, and status, but I should verify whether these are actually distinct, testable fields with proper labels rather than just a general assertion about what the panel shows.\n\nI'm also wondering if there's an AppRevisions.md file that might clarify some of these details. The main gaps I'm seeing are the missing close button test for the details panel and whether REC-PNL-6 is specific enough about what fields should actually be present and labeled.\n\nLet me check the

Let me systematically check each directive from each skill document against the code, test entries, and test files.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecRecipesPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations\n\nLet me check each testSpec.md directive against the RecipesPage test entries in docs/tests.md:\n\n### testSpec.md Directives:\n\n1. **\"Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\"**\n   - This is a design/implementation concern, not really a test spec entry issue. No violation.\n   \n2. **\"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\"**\n   - Checking the coverage: the page title, search bar, status filter dropdown, and add recipe button all have corresponding test entries, though the search and filter combination test appears to be cut off in the documentation.\n   - Moving through the table elements: column headers, row data, status badges in their various states, edit and delete icons, row selection behavior, highlighting, and pagination controls are all accounted for.\n   - Still verifying the remaining table features like draft indicators and version information.\n   - Now checking the details panel: the title, tab navigation, content sections for general info and materials, notes, and instructions are working correctly, with tab switching preserving the recipe state and handling empty states properly.\n   - I'm noticing the close button on the RecipeDetailsPanel hasn't been verified yet—need to check that.\n   - Looking at the clickable elements and their expected behaviors: the Add Recipe button opens a modal with specific fields, the edit pencil opens a pre-filled form, the delete trash triggers a confirmation dialog, and table rows should navigate to details.\n   - The close button on the RecipeDetailsPanel is a visible interactive element that has no corresponding test entry, which is a clear gap.\n   - For data mutations, I'm verifying that Add, Edit, and Delete operations all persist correctly after navigation, though there's no timeline feature to test for recipes.\n   - Button and control styling is covered across the board—the blue Add Recipe button, pencil and trash icons, and status badge colors all have test entries.\n   - For modals, I've got the Add Recipe flow fully tested, but the Edit Recipe modal still needs verification that it opens correctly, displays pre-filled values, and saves changes properly.\n   - I'm noticing a gap though: neither the Add Recipe nor Edit Recipe modal has test coverage for the cancel or close paths—just the happy path of submitting/saving. That's a violation of the \"completely test modal dialogs\" requirement since both have Cancel buttons and close icons that should be tested.\n\n   Moving through the remaining directives, most don't apply to this page—no attachment uploads, no import dialogs, no configurable backend integrations, and no timeline or relationship features to test for state propagation.\n\n   So far I've found two violations: the missing RecipeDetailsPanel close button test and the missing cancel/close tests for both modals.\n\n   Looking more carefully at the actual component code, the RecipeDetailsPanel has a close button with `data-testid=\"recipe-panel-close\"` that clears the selected recipe. The Add Recipe modal has both a Cancel button and a close X button, and the Edit Recipe modal has the same—all of these are interactive elements that need test entries but don't have them. These are clear violations of the modal testing requirement.\n\nNow I'm moving to check the RecipesPage components against the writeApp.md directives. Most of these are process-level or visual requirements that can't be verified through code inspection alone, like running npm check or matching the mockup appearance. I need to focus on what's actually verifiable in the code itself.\n\nLooking at the data-testid requirement across all the components—RecipesHeader, AddRecipeModal, RecipesTable, EditRecipeModal, and RecipeDetailsPanel—they all have the necessary test identifiers on their interactive elements, containers, and list items that E2E tests would need to target.\n\nThe config-level directive about netlify.toml doesn't apply here since we're working at the component level. For the neon serverless driver requirement, I'll need to check that when I review the backend function.\n\nNow looking at database column handling—that's a backend concern, not relevant to the component. Same with Netlify Functions path indexing.\n\nFor the modal entity reference guideline, the Add Recipe modal has a Product field that appears to be a plain text input rather than a reference to a separate entity based on the AppSpec, so that's not a violation. The Status field already uses a custom dropdown, and there aren't other entity references in the modals to worry about.\n\nChecking the remaining guidelines: navigation duplicates don't apply here, custom dropdowns are being used throughout instead of native HTML select elements, and attachment-related rules are N/A since there are no attachments on this page. Moving on to the next directive...\n\nThe RecipesPage root element uses a `page-content` CSS class, so I need to verify whether this class already includes the required `p-6 max-sm:p-3` padding utilities or if they need to be added directly to the element. I need to focus on the actual Directives section rather than the Tips. Let me review what the directives actually require: running npm check, identifying test entries, matching the visual mockup, and a few other requirements I should finish reading through. I need to verify the `page-content` CSS class has the proper padding equivalent to `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. I'm also noticing that `recipe.instructions` appears in multiple places within the RecipesPage—both in the Materials tab's \"Notes & Instructions\" section and in the Instructions tab itself, which seems like duplication I should investigate.\n\nLooking at the RecipeDetailData interface, there's only `description` and `instructions` fields available, no separate `notes` field, so the component is using `instructions` for both sections. This might be intentional or it could be a data structure issue that needs clarification against the test spec

Let me systematically go through my findings.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecRecipesPage\n\nLet me check each test entry against testSpec.md directives:\n\n### Checking each test entry:\n\n**REC-HDR-1**: Page title ✓\n**REC-HDR-2**: Search bar with placeholder ✓\n**REC-HDR-3**: Search filters by name ✓\n**REC-HDR-4**: Search filters by product ✓\n**REC-HDR-5**: Clear search restores all ✓\n\n\n**REC-HDR-6 through REC-HDR-13**: Continuing through the status filter options, the active/draft/archived filters, the all filter restoration, the Add Recipe button display, and the full creation workflow including form submission and persistence verification all check out. REC-HDR-14 appears to be cut off but seems to be starting another test entry.\n\nNow moving into the table section—I'm verifying the column headers display correctly, the row data aligns properly, and the status badges render with the right colors for each state. The edit and delete actions are working as expected, including the pencil icon opening the edit form with persistence, the trash icon triggering deletion with a confirmation dialog, and the ability to cancel that deletion.\n\nClicking a row opens the RecipeDetailsPanel and highlights the selected row, while pagination controls are functioning properly with the page numbers and navigation buttons responding correctly, including disabled states at the boundaries. I'm also checking that draft versions display their indicator.\n\nMoving into the panel itself, the title displays and updates correctly, the tabs are showing up, and the General Info tab content is rendering along with the Materials table headers.\n\nNow I'm seeing there are some gaps in the test coverage—specifically, the close button on the RecipeDetailsPanel isn't being tested, and there's a missing test for the cancel or close action in the Add flow.\n\nLooking more carefully at the modal tests, I notice REC-TBL-10 covers cancelling the delete confirmation, but the Add Recipe and Edit Recipe modals don't have corresponding cancel test entries. The directives are pretty explicit about needing complete modal dialog testing and accounting for every clickable element, so these gaps seem worth addressing with fix tasks.\n\nNow I'm checking the RecipesPage component against the writeApp.md requirements. The data-testid attributes are all there, no native select elements are being used, and the page padding matches the spec with the right responsive breakpoints.\n\nThe backend is correctly using tagged template literals for the database queries. For the empty string handling, those fields are text columns rather than DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID types, so the current approach is fine. The path indexing logic correctly extracts the recipe ID from the fourth segment after filtering out empty parts. I need to verify the searchable select implementation next.\n\nLooking at the Product field in the modals—it's just a plain text input, not a reference to another entity, so that's not an issue. The delete button uses `btn-danger` which should render as red styling, matching the test expectations. I think I've covered the main validation points here. The `product` field on the recipes table is just free-text, not a foreign key reference, so that's not a violation. The components look clean overall.\n\nNow I'm moving to Subtask 3 to check the Playwright tests against the writeTests.md directives, starting with verifying that navigation assertions check actual URLs or page content rather than just handler existence. EC-TBL-11 opens the details panel and verifies the title ✓\n   - REC-HDR-13 navigates to /calendar and /recipes, checks URL ✓\n   - Pagination tests check page numbers ✓   \n   - All good. ✓\n\n2. **\"When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages, tests must interact with that component on each page... Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component.\"**\n   - The persistence tests use `page.goto(\"/calendar\")` and then `page.goto(\"/recipes\")` to verify data persistence after navigation. This is for persistence verification, not for testing cross-page component availability. This is fine - the test is specifically verifying that data persists, not that a component is available on another page. ✓\n\n3. **\"For actions that produce side effects, write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once.\"**\n   - No timeline/history features for recipes, so this doesn't apply here.\n\n4. **\"Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings.\"**\n   - The tests rely on `getByTestId` and filtered locators with `hasText`, so there's no problematic `getByText()` usage. ✓\n\n5. **\"All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent.\"**\n   - Different test files use appropriate testids for their respective pages and components. ✓\n\n6. **\"When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics.\"**\n   - No file uploads in the recipes tests, so this doesn't apply.\n\n7. **\"NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside a `.toPass()` retry block.\"**\n   - No `.toPass()` blocks found in the recipes tests. ✓\n\n8. **\"Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks.\"**\n   - recipes-page.spec.ts has no `beforeEach` hooks, and recipe-details.spec.ts uses `beforeAll` and `afterAll` appropriately for test data setup and cleanup. ✓\n\n9. **\"For assertions that depend on backend round-trips, use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`).\"**\n   - Now I'm checking what timeout values the tests are using for backend-dependent assertions.\n\n10. **\"For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test, add `test.slow()`.\"**\n    - REC-HDR-13, REC-TBL-7, and REC-TBL-9 all have `test.slow()` applied to their multi-step flows. ✓\n\n11. **\"When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field, the test must exercise that exact field.\"**\n    - REC-TBL-7 is testing the version field edit specifically.\n\n12. **\"Tests within the same spec file share a worker... Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count.\"**\n    - REC-HDR-5 uses `toHaveCount(5)` which is checking pagination behavior on the first page rather than asserting a fixed database count, so it should be fine as long as the seed data has at least 5 recipes. Though this could be more robust.\n    - REC-HDR-3 and REC-HDR-4 use `toHaveCount(1)` with specific search terms like \"Granola\" and \"Jam\" - these are fragile in theory, but the search terms are specific enough that other tests are unlikely to create conflicting recipes. The count=5 assertions would still work even if tests add recipes, as long as there are still at least 5 items on the first page.\n    \n    REC-TBL-9 is self-contained since it creates and deletes its test recipe. REC-HDR-13 creates a \"Test Recipe\" without cleaning it up, which could affect other tests if they search or count recipes. The real issue is that `fullyParallel: true` in the Playwright config means tests can run in parallel even within the same file, and they share the same worker, which could cause data conflicts.\n\n    The count assertions in REC-HDR-3, REC-HDR-5, and REC-HDR-11 could fail if REC-HDR-13's leftover \"Test Recipe\" affects the results. The `toHaveCount(5)` checks are particularly vulnerable since they're checking exact counts that could be thrown off by uncleaned test data.\n\n    Actually, wait—`toHaveCount(5)` is just checking visible rows on page 1, which will always be min(PAGE_SIZE, totalItems). As long as there are at least 5 recipes, this stays 5 regardless of how many more exist. And the `toHaveCount(1)` assertions after specific searches are safe because the search terms are targeted enough. The parallel test design looks acceptable.\n\n    Moving on to the other checklist items: no hardcoded database IDs are present, tests discover records by name or content instead. The Playwright config requirements like `fullyParallel: true` and global timeout settings are outside the scope of what I'm reviewing here.\n\n    Overall, I'm not seeing any violations of the writeTests.md directives. The tests follow good patterns—they use data-testid selectors consistently, have reasonable timeouts, apply test.slow() for longer flows, and avoid problematic patterns like getByText with generic words or .toPass() with nested awaits. Let me just verify one more thing about that loop in the recipe-details test where it's iterating over products from the known recipe object.\n\n    Both loops I'm checking are fine since they're iterating over actual data from the beforeAll setup rather than relying on anti-patterns. So my findings are that there are three missing test entries: the RecipeDetailsPanel close button isn't covered, and both the Add Recipe and Edit Recipe modals are missing tests for their cancel/close functionality—all of which violate the requirement that every interactive element must be tested.\n\nFor the writeApp.md and writeTests.md violations, I don't see any issues. The existing tests all follow the directives properly, and while the missing test entries mean there will be missing tests, that's a spec problem to fix first before writing the actual test code.\n\nNow I need to create fix tasks for those missing test entries in the spec—specifically for the interactive elements in modals and panels that aren't documented
