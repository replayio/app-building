Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches.

Let me analyze it carefully:\n\nThe mockup shows:\n1. A top navigation bar with: TaskFlow logo, Dashboard, Projects, Tasks (highlighted), Team, and a user avatar dropdown\n2. \"Upcoming Tasks\" title with \"New Task\" button (blue/accent) on the right\n3. A filter bar with filter icon/dropdown and \"Filter...\" text input\n4. Task cards showing:\n   - Priority badge (High=red, Medium=yellow, Low=green, Normal=blue/teal)\n   - Task title\n   - Due date/time\n   - Assignee avatar + name + role\n   - Action menu\n\nI can see four task cards in the mockup: a high-priority marketing plan due today, a medium-priority client proposal due tomorrow, a low-priority documentation update due October 25th, and a normal-priority status report due October 26th. Now let me check the testSpec.md directory to understand the testing requirements.\n\nLooking at the test directives, I need to ensure consistent styling and navigation across pages, systematically inventory every visible element in the mockup, and test for all columns and filter controls shown—not just the easiest ones to implement. I should avoid substituting simpler elements for what's actually displayed.\n\nFor clickable elements, I need to specify exact navigation targets or action results without ambiguity, and for actions that mutate data, verify persistence and side effects occur correctly without duplicates. Button appearance matters too—I should test the specific text, icons, and styling shown in the mockup. Modal dialogs need thorough testing, attachment functionality should support file uploads by default, and import/upload features need complete coverage.\n\nNow I'm systematically going through the TasksListPage test entries to check them against these requirements. Looking at the components listed—PageHeader with the \"Upcoming Tasks\" title and \"New Task\" button, FilterBar with dropdown and text input, and TaskCards with priority badges and due dates—I'm verifying each one matches the mockup specifications.\n\nI notice the mockup shows a top navigation bar with Dashboard, Projects, Tasks, and Team, which differs from the sidebar navigation used elsewhere in the app. Since the first directive prioritizes consistent navigation styling, this is acceptable as long as it's intentional.\n\nNow I'm checking the specific test entries for PageHeader—TLP-HDR-01 validates the title and button presence, TLP-HDR-02 checks the modal fields for creating a new task, and TLP-HDR-03 verifies that creating a task persists the data and triggers appropriate side effects.\n\nFor the FilterBar, the test coverage looks solid: priority filtering, text search, assignee and client filters, plus the ability to clear all filters. The mockup shows a filter dropdown and text input, which aligns with what the tests are validating.\n\nNow checking the TaskCards section...\n\nthe tests cover the core card functionality—displaying task info with priority badges, sorting by due date, navigation to the detail view with the correct URL structure, and the action menu with complete, edit, and delete operations. The tests also verify that edits persist and deletions require confirmation, which is good for data integrity.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the navigation component itself has test coverage. The TasksListPage lists \"Navigation\" as a component, but there are no actual test entries for it—no TLP-NAV entries like there are for the ClientsListPage. That's a gap. Every visible element should have corresponding tests, so the navigation bar needs its own test entries to fully satisfy the requirements. I notice the action menus are covered, but there's no test entry for the Navigation component itself. Looking at the mockup versus the actual app, there's a mismatch—the mockup shows a top nav with \"Dashboard\", \"Projects\", \"Tasks\", \"Team\", but the app uses a sidebar with \"Clients\", \"Deals\", \"Tasks\", \"Team\", \"Settings\". Since the directive prioritizes consistent navigation across the app, the TasksListPage should use the sidebar navigation instead.\n\nI'm seeing a real gap here: the ClientsListPage has test entries for SidebarNavigation (CLP-NAV-01, CLP-NAV-02), but TasksListPage lists a Navigation component with no test entries at all. The directive requires systematically inventorying every visible element, so this is a violation. While duplicating navigation tests across every page seems redundant, the TasksListPage at minimum needs documented test coverage for its navigation component.\n\nLooking at the priority badge colors in the mockup, the test entry TLP-CRD-02 already covers all four levels (High as red, Medium as yellow/amber, Low as green, Normal as blue/gray), so that's accounted for. Now I need to check whether the card-based layout matches what the test spec actually describes.\n\nThe action menu items are Edit, Mark Complete, and Delete—no View option. TLP-CRD-04 handles clicking the card itself to navigate to the task detail page, while TLP-CRD-07 covers the Edit action opening a modal. That covers the main interactions, though I should verify the remaining directives are satisfied.\n\nNow checking persistence and side effects: TLP-HDR-03 confirms task creation persists with the right display properties, but doesn't explicitly mention timeline entries. However, TLP-CRD-06 does verify that Mark Complete creates a timeline entry on the associated client, and ATOM-01 in the cross-cutting tests covers this scenario more broadly. TLP-CRD-08 just notes the change persists for edits, so I need to check if timeline entries are being tested for all mutation types.\n\nFor the button appearance, TLP-HDR-01 correctly specifies \"New Task\" matching the mockup, and the modal dialog tests in TLP-HDR-02 cover the new task form fields.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing a gap in the modal testing—there's no test for the Cancel button on the task creation modal to verify it closes without saving. The DealsListPage has an equivalent test (DLP-HDR-06), so TasksListPage should too. This looks like a potential violation of directive 7 requiring complete modal dialog coverage.\n\nThe attachment and import dialog directives appear to be covered, and I'm now checking the backend integration requirements.\n\nFor state-changing actions, the delete test covers removal from the client and deal, and the create test should verify the task appears in the associated client's Tasks section, though cross-cutting tests might already handle this.\n\nThe page title matches the mockup (\"Upcoming Tasks\"), so that's confirmed. Now I'm reviewing the mockup elements more carefully to see what else might be missing.\n\nLooking at the navigation component, I notice there are no test entries for it at all—the active state of the Tasks tab should be tested. And while TLP-CRD-04 clearly specifies clicking the card itself versus the menu, I don't see an explicit test for clicking just the task title within the card.\n\nFor the task creation modal, there's a gap: the Cancel button needs a test to verify it closes without saving, similar to what's covered in the DealsListPage. Also, when a task is created and linked to a client, the test should verify that task shows up on the client's detail page too, not just in the local creation flow. Looking at directive 7 more carefully, I need to ensure every modal is fully tested—opening, field completion, saving, canceling, and validation. For the task creation modal, I'm missing the cancel action test, and I should verify the edit modal's save functionality as well. The clearest gaps are the missing Navigation test entries per directive 2 and that cancel button coverage for task creation. The task creation modal's missing cancel test is a clear violation of the directive to completely test modal dialogs, and the navigation component having no test entries violates the requirement to inventory every visible element. Now I'm moving through Job 2 and Job 3 to check for similar issues, but first let me double-check the mockup details—the \"Upcoming Tasks\" title appears consistently between the mockup and test spec, so that checks

Consistent navigation/styling over exact mockup adherence\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\n3. Don't substitute easier elements\n4. Every clickable element must specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. Mutation actions must verify persistence and side effects\n6. Button/control appearance must match mockup\n7.

The mockup shows a top nav bar with Tasks highlighted. Per directive 2 (inventory every visible element), there should be at least a test verifying the navigation exists and Tasks is active. Other pages (ClientsListPage) have CLP-NAV-01/02 for navigation.\n\n2. **No cancel test for task creation modal** — Per directive 7 (completely test modal dialogs), there's no test for clicking Cancel on the task creation modal to verify it closes without creating a task.

When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n2. Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n3. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything that E2E tests will need to target.\n\n\n4. For monorepo setups with the app in a subdirectory, configure `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` in `netlify.toml`.\n5. When using the neon serverless driver, stick to tagged template literal syntax exclusively.\n6. For DATE, TIMESTAMP, and UUID database columns, convert empty strings to null using `value || null` before any insert or update operations.\n7. In Netlify Functions, the resource ID is located at path index 3, not index 2.\n8. When building modals that reference other entities, use searchable select or dropdown components instead of plain text inputs for IDs.\n9. Navigation sidebars and menus have additional requirements that appear to be cut off.\n10. Avoid native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls and dropdowns.\n11. Attachment displays should render file-type-specific icons or thumbnails.\n12. Attachment functionality needs to support actual file uploads.\n\nNow I'm checking the TasksListPage component against these directives — it has the proper test ID, avoids native select elements, uses FilterSelect appropriately for modals, and the outer padding on the page root seems acceptable since pages can have padding unlike regular components.\n\nTasksPageHeader is properly set up with test IDs for the header itself, import button, and new task button, and uses the correct icons and button labels.\n\nTasksFilterBar has all the required test IDs for the filter bar, filter button, dropdown, and individual filter controls for priority, assignee, and client, plus the search field...\n\nChecking TaskCard test IDs...\n\nThe task-action-delete test ID is there, icons are being used properly, and there's a priority badge showing. For TaskPriorityBadge, I'm seeing the color mapping is correct—high is red, medium is amber, low is green, normal is blue—but the colors are hardcoded with Tailwind classes instead of being defined as CSS variables in the theme block like the directive specifies. I need to distinguish between directives and tips in writeApp.md. The CSS variables guidance is actually listed as a tip, not a directive, so that's not a violation. Let me focus on the actual directives and check them systematically. Looking at directive 8 about modals with entity references, I can see CreateTaskModal is using FilterSelect with searchable enabled for both Client and Deal fields, which satisfies the requirement.\n\nFor the Assignee field, it uses FilterSelect when users are available but falls back to a plain text input when the list is empty. Since the normal case uses the searchable select component and the fallback only handles edge cases, this seems like a reasonable implementation rather than a clear violation. Checking directive 10 about avoiding native select elements, all the filter bars and modals are consistently using FilterSelect instead of HTML select, so that's compliant.\n\nNow I'm verifying the date handling across the modals—both CreateTaskModal and EditTaskModal convert empty date values to null using the same pattern, which satisfies the directive requirements. Moving on to check the test entry requirements against the component code to ensure everything specified in the spec is actually implemented.\n\nLooking at the test entries, I notice a discrepancy: TLP-HDR-02 specifies \"due date/time\" with the mockup showing \"Due: Today, 5:00 PM\", but CreateTaskModal only uses a date input without time selection. This means the current implementation is missing the time component that the spec appears to require. The date input only accepts YYYY-MM-DD format without time, so there's a clear mismatch with the test requirements that specify times like \"Today, 5:00 PM\". The create modal needs to support time selection to satisfy the test entry requirements, which means this is a violation of directive 1. I'm noticing the TaskCard can display times through its `formatDueDate` function for today and tomorrow, but the CreateTaskModal only has a date picker without time selection—that's inconsistent with the spec requirement for \"due date/time\" in TLP-HDR-02. Looking at the mockup, the TaskCard layout matches what's expected with priority badges, title, due date/time, assignee info, and menu. Now I need to verify the data-testid coverage across all interactive elements and containers for E2E testing. The data-testid coverage looks complete. Now I'm verifying the `due_date` handling—empty strings convert to null as expected. I'm also checking the form fields across both modals and confirming they all use FilterSelect components rather than native select elements, so there shouldn't be any select-related issues.\n\nI've spotted a potential violation: CreateTaskModal only has a date picker without time selection, but the test entry TLP-HDR-03 expects to set \"Today, 5:00 PM\"—this means the app doesn't fully support the datetime functionality required by the test specifications. Now I'm examining the visual styling against the mockup to see if there are other directive violations, particularly around button variants, badges, and layout structure.\n\nThe assignee avatars are another issue—the mockup displays actual user photos, but the code uses a generic User icon placeholder. The directive explicitly says not to simplify the visual design, so this discrepancy could count as a violation, though it's somewhat understandable if the data model doesn't support storing user profile pictures. I need to determine whether this is a reasonable compromise or a genuine design simplification that breaks the requirements.\n\nFor the clearer violations, the CreateTaskModal is missing time selection on the due date field—it only captures the date itself, but the test entries explicitly require both date and time support. That's a direct conflict with the directive that test entry requirements must be satisfied by the app code. I've identified the main issue: the input side uses a date-only picker while the display side can show times, creating a mismatch with the requirement to set times like \"Today, 5:00 PM\". The scope is specifically TasksListPage components, so I should focus on the frontend rather than backend functions. I'm also noticing that the root div has outer padding, which violates the layout-agnostic principle mentioned in the directives. I found another issue with the EditTaskModal too—it also uses `type=\"date\"` without time selection. Now let me verify the card layout against the requirements. Looking at TaskCard.tsx, the priority badge is positioned first in the flex container, so it appears on the left side of the card as specified.\n\nThe main violations I'm seeing are the missing time picker in both the creation and editing flows. Let me finalize my findings and skip the checks that fall outside the TasksListPage scope, like the sidebar navigation and backend driver issues.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the data-testid requirements across all interactive elements and containers. Looking at TasksListPage.tsx, the root div has the proper testid, but I'm noticing the loading state and empty state divs don't have testids — though based on the actual test entries, they don't seem to be targeting those specific containers anyway.\n\nMoving through CreateTaskModal.tsx, I can see most form inputs are properly tagged: the modal container, close button, title input, description textarea, due date input, priority select, assignee fields, and client select all have testids. I need to verify the deal select and any remaining form elements are also covered.\n\nChecking EditTaskModal.tsx now, and I notice the description field uses a slightly different naming convention than the create modal, but that's not necessarily problematic. I'm continuing through the assignee fields and other inputs to ensure consistent test coverage across both modals. I'm verifying that FilterSelect properly accepts and renders the testId prop based on how it's used throughout the codebase, and the pattern looks consistent. Now I'm identifying the key violation: the due date inputs in both CreateTaskModal and EditTaskModal only support date selection without time, but the test requirements explicitly call for date and time together—like \"Today, 5:00 PM\"—which means the app isn't meeting the specified test entry requirements. Let me reconsider whether the time component might be handled differently in the actual test execution. I've finished checking all the components for native `<select>` elements—they're all using custom FilterSelect components as required. Now I'm moving into Job 3, but I should first wrap up my findings for Job 2. The main issue I found is that the date inputs in CreateTaskModal and EditTaskModal don't support time selection, which might not fully satisfy the test requirement for \"due date/time\" in entry TLP-HDR-02. Though I need to reconsider whether this actually constitutes a directive violation based on how the requirement is framed. Looking at the test requirement more carefully, TLP-HDR-03 explicitly asks to set a time (\"5:00 PM\"), but the current implementation only has a date input without time support. The backend is storing just the date value, so times can't actually be persisted. This is a real violation that needs fixing. I've confirmed there's a legitimate violation here—the app doesn't support setting times for tasks, but the test expects users to be able to set \"Today, 5:00 PM\", which violates the writeApp.md directive. Now I'm moving on to check the TasksListPage tests for any writeTests.md directive violations, starting by locating the Playwright test

Also assert the side effect happens exactly once.\n\n3. **Avoid using `getByText()` with common words** that may appear as substrings. Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n\n\n4. **Maintain consistent `data-testid` values** across all test files for the same component by checking existing specs first.\n\n5. **File upload tests must exercise actual file upload mechanics** rather than simulating with text or URL inputs.\n\n6. **Never nest Playwright locator calls with auto-wait inside `.toPass()` retry blocks** when iterating over dynamic elements.\n\n7. **Strategy files are located in `/repo/strategies/jobs/`** and its subdirectories.\n\n8. **Apps with login/signup functionality require complete e2e test coverage**.\n\nFor parallel test design, I need to ensure tests don't depend on fixed record counts, create their own pristine datasets when needed, avoid hardcoded database IDs, and configure `fullyParallel: true` instead of `workers: 1`. Now I'm reviewing each test case — TLP-HDR-01 looks good with its role-based heading query and testid for the button. For TLP-HDR-02, I'm checking whether the `getByText` calls on the modal for form labels like \"Title *\", \"Description\", \"Due Date\", and \"Priority\" are problematic or acceptable.\n\nThe scoped modal queries reduce ambiguity risk, though \"Description\" and \"Priority\" are common words that could theoretically match multiple elements. Since these target label elements within the modal, the risk is low, but ideally these should use testids for more precise targeting per the directive. It's a marginal issue rather than a clear violation. Now moving on to TLP-HDR-03.\n\nThe test creates unique task names with timestamps for parallel execution, selects an assignee using locator operations with a conditional fallback pattern, and verifies the task appears in the page content. The conditional check for the assignee option and the fallback to clicking the second button is somewhat fragile but doesn't violate the directives since the locator calls are properly awaited outside of `.toPass()` blocks.\n\nThe assertion checking if the task title exists anywhere in the page body is imprecise—it should use Playwright's auto-retrying `expect(page.getByText(taskTitle)).toBeVisible()` instead to handle timing issues properly. Now I'm checking TLP-FLT-02 around lines 183-190 where `.toPass()` contains locator calls with auto-wait semantics, which looks like it might violate directive 6. I need to reconsider whether `count()` actually has auto-wait semantics or not — looking back at the Playwright documentation, `count()` resolves immediately without retrying, so it wouldn't violate the directive about auto-wait calls inside `.toPass()` blocks.\n\nBut wait, the directive explicitly lists `count()` as an example of auto-wait semantics, which means I was wrong about my understanding. The fix is to use locator chaining and single-assertion matchers like `.toHaveCount()` instead, which would handle the retry logic properly without the DOM consistency issues.\n\nSo TLP-FLT-02 does have a `.toPass()` violation that needs fixing...\n\nWriting the corrected test... I'm checking the rest of TLP-FLT-03 to see if there are any violations of directive 6, looking at whether async operations are properly wrapped in `.toPass()` blocks or if they're standalone calls that could cause flakiness.\n\nNow examining TLP-FLT-04 more closely — the test is trying to interact with native `<option>` elements using `locator('option')`, but the actual FilterSelect component in the app is a custom implementation that doesn't use native `<select>` elements, so this test would likely fail because it's looking for DOM elements that don't actually exist. The `selectFilterOption` helper shows the correct pattern for interacting with FilterSelect components—clicking the trigger and then selecting from button-based options—but TLP-FLT-04 bypasses this entirely by using native select methods instead, which won't work with the custom component.\n\nTLP-FLT-05 has the same problem, trying to use `locator('option')` and `selectOption()` on what's clearly a FilterSelect component. Now I'm checking the test directives to see what else might be missing—TLP-CRD-04 correctly verifies the URL after navigation, but I need to look at whether the tests are properly asserting side effects beyond just checking that clicks happen.\n\nTLP-CRD-06 and TLP-CRD-09 are both problematic here. Mark Complete should verify not just that the card disappears, but also that the change persists and a timeline entry gets created. Delete has the same gap—it only checks visibility, not persistence or that the task is actually removed from the associated client or deal. The directive is clear: side effects like timeline updates need to be verified, and they should happen exactly once. I'm seeing that side effects like timeline entries and visibility changes might not be fully verified in individual tests, though cross-cutting tests could cover them—but the directive seems to expect each test to validate its own side effects. The clearest violations I'm finding are TLP-FLT-02 using `.toPass()` with `count()` calls, and TLP-FLT-04 and TLP-FLT-05 attempting native select interactions on a custom component that won't work. I should also double-check directive 3 about avoiding getByText() with common substrings.\n\nLooking through the getByText usage, most are scoped to modals or dialogs where they should be unique—TLP-HDR-02's label texts within the modal and TLP-HDR-05's \"Import Tasks\" in the dialog both seem fine. File uploads look correct with setInputFiles. Now I need to check for hardcoded IDs and other potential issues.\n\nThe tests are using Date.now() for unique identifiers and extracting task IDs dynamically from test attributes, which is good. Relative comparisons between initial and restored counts avoid hardcoding specific numbers. Let me look at the parallel test design settings and then wrap up my findings.\n\nI'm seeing two clear violations so far: TLP-FLT-02 uses .toPass() with nested count() calls which breaks directive 6, and TLP-FLT-04 has another issue I need to identify.\n\nTLP-FLT-04 and TLP-FLT-05 both interact with FilterSelect using native `<select>` and `selectOption()` methods, but that doesn't match how the component is actually structured or how other tests handle it. There are also some marginal issues where tests skip verifying side effects like timeline entries or cross-page consistency, and several rely on broad textContent assertions instead of more targeted checks. Now I need to determine which of these warrant creating fix

Verify navigation targets precisely (URL/content, not just click handler)\n2. Verify side effects for state-changing actions (both primary and side effects, exactly once)\n3. Avoid ambiguous `getByText()` with common words; prefer `getByTestId`\n4. Consistent `data-testid` values across test files for same component\n5. File upload tests use actual `setInputFiles`\n6. NEVER put auto-wait locator calls (`count()`, `textContent()`, `isVisible()`) inside `.toPass()`\n7. Strategy file paths\n8. E2E auth test requirement\n\n**Checking each test systematically:**\n\n**TLP-HDR-01**: Uses `getByRole('heading')` and `getByTestId` ✓\n\n**TLP-HDR-02**: Uses `modal.getByText('Title *')`, `modal.getByText('Description')` — scoped to modal, marginally OK\n\n**TLP-HDR-03**: Creates unique task with `Date.now()` ✓, checks persistence ✓\n\n**TLP-HDR-04**: Uses `getByTestId` consistently ✓, checks disabled state ✓\n\n**TLP-HDR-05**: Uses `setInputFiles` for file upload ✓ (directive 5)\n\n**TLP-FLT-01**: Uses `getByTestId` ✓\n\n**TLP-FLT-02** (lines 183-190): Uses `.toPass()` with `await cards.count()` and `await highBadges.count()` inside. **VIOLATION of directive 6** — `count()` is explicitly listed as an auto-wait call that must NOT be inside `.toPass()`. Should use atomic assertion like:\n```ts\nawait expect(\n  page.locator('[data-testid^=\"task-card-\"]').filter({\n    hasNot: page.locator('[data-testid=\"task-priority-badge-high\"]')\n  })\n).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 10000 });\n```\n\n**TLP-FLT-04** (lines 231-237): Uses `assigneeSelect.locator('option').all()` and `assigneeSelect.selectOption()` — these are **native `<select>` interaction methods** on a FilterSelect custom component. The FilterSelect renders custom dropdown buttons, NOT native `<option>` elements. This test will likely fail at runtime. **VIOLATION** — inconsistent with how FilterSelect is interacted with in other tests (e.g., TLP-HDR-03 uses the trigger/menu/button pattern). Should use the `selectFilterOption` helper or equivalent.\n\n**TLP-FLT-05** (lines 258-264): Same issue as TLP-FLT-04 — uses `clientSelect.locator('option').all()` and `clientSelect.selectOption()` on a FilterSelect custom component. **Same violation**.\n\n**TLP-CRD-04**: Asserts `page.toHaveURL(new RegExp(`/tasks/${taskId}`))` ✓ — verifies precise navigation target (directive 1)\n\n**TLP-CRD-06**: Verifies task disappears but does NOT verify persistence (reload) or timeline entry on associated client. The test entry says \"Change persisted. Timeline entry created on associated client.\" — **Partial violation of directive 2**.\n\n**TLP-CRD-09**: Verifies card disappears but doesn't verify persistence or cross-page effects. — **Partial violation of directive 2**.\n\n---\n\nNow let me compile all violations found across all three jobs and determine what fix groups to add.\n\n**Summary of all violations found:**\n\n**From Job 1 (testSpec.md):**\n1.
