Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

The test entries are about the UI documentation showing how to call the endpoint. The actual bug is about the backend Netlify function implementation — specifically:\n\n1. Not awaiting a fetch call in a serverless function context (causing the request to not be sent before the context freezes)\n2. Missing retry logic for transient errors\n\nThis is a functional problem about backend behavior. The test entries say nothing about whether the spawn-container endpoint actually works — they only test the UI documentation about the endpoint. The tests are about what the WebhookHelpButton shows, not about the actual endpoint functioning.\n \nWorking through the classification steps, this is clearly a backend functional issue, not a styling problem. The old test entries don't cover the actual endpoint behavior at all — they only document how to call it from the UI. So this is about existing functionality that's broken and needs fixing, not new functionality being requested. the problem stage is `testSpec.md`. But I'm second-guessing myself — can playwright tests even verify backend endpoint behavior directly? The real issue here is that the endpoint has an implementation bug: a fire-and-forget fetch pattern that doesn't work in serverless contexts, plus missing retry logic. This feels more like a code quality problem in the writeApp stage than a test specification gap.\n\nLet me apply the classification rules strictly though. Following the flow: it's a functional problem, the old tests don't cover the spawn endpoint's actual behavior, and for existing functionality with underspecified test entries, the problem stage is `testSpec.md`. The test spec should include an entry verifying that calling the spawn-container endpoint actually creates a container, which a playwright test could validate by checking the database state transitions from pending to running. That would have caught this bug.\n\nNow checking AppRevisions.md — it was updated during the fix, but since the fix just corrected the implementation to match the already-specified behavior rather than changing what the app is supposed to do, the documentation doesn't need updating for this particular issue.","signature":"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

For example:\n    73→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    74→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    75→\n    76→## Tips\n    77→\n    78→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch.

This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    82→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type).
