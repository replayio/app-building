My subtask is:\n1. Unpack: Check directive compliance\n\nThis is an \"Unpack\" task, so I need to:\n1. Read `docs/tests.md` to understand the existing application structure\n2. Add one task per page using `add-task`, with all checks for that page in the same task\n3. Also add a separate task for non-page specific checks (backend)\n\nLet me first find which app I'm working with, then read the tests.md file.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2776,"cache_read_input_tokens":23641,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2776,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"647fae73-52be-4532-9b94-b338bec684ab","uuid":"d36d0830-44ae-4923-975e-88e4555ecfb8"}
