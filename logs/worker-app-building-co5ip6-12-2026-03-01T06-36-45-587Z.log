This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker.

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other.

Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- Apps that receive webhooks from external services must include a webhook help/documentation UI\n    67→  accessible from the app's status or admin page. The help UI must list each webhook endpoint with its\n    68→  URL path, HTTP method, authentication requirements (e.g., Bearer token, query parameter), required\n    69→  and optional payload fields, and an example curl command. Example curl commands must use the actual\n    70→  deployed site URL (derived from the current page origin) rather than placeholder values — commands\n    71→  should be ready to use as-is. Each curl command and endpoint URL should have a copy-to-clipboard\n    72→  button so users can quickly use them. Test entries should verify that the help UI is accessible via a\n    73→  clearly labeled button, displays accurate documentation for each webhook endpoint, uses the actual\n    74→  site URL in examples, and provides working copy buttons.\n    75→\n    76→- For apps that expose backend API endpoints (webhooks, serverless functions, etc.), the test specification\n    77→  must include entries that verify the endpoints actually function correctly — not just that their\n    78→  documentation or help UI is accurate. Test entries should cover calling each endpoint with valid inputs\n    79→  and verifying the expected side effects (e.g., database records created or updated, status transitions\n    80→  completed, downstream processes triggered).\n    81→\n    82→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    83→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    84→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    85→\n    86→## Tips\n    87→\n    88→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    89→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    90→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    91→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    92→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    93→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    94→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    95→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    96→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    97→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    98→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019ASLF9TmabKQ9ujfhJ37p4","session_id":"08e4eb64-0001-4076-b414-5268e401dc39","uuid":"fce0de7b-bc1c-4e20-aab2-f81557c18c5d"}

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n     4→\n     5→## Unpack Subtasks\n     6→\n     7→Unpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n     8→\n     9→First, add a setup task:\n    10→```\n    11→npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n    12→  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n    13→  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n    14→```\n    15→\n    16→Then add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n    17→```\n    18→npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n    19→  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n    20→  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n    21→  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n    22→```\n    23→\n    24→## Guidelines\n    25→\n    26→- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n   102→  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n   103→  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n   104→  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n   105→  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n   106→  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n   107→  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n   108→\n   109→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   110→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   111→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   112→\n   113→## Tips\n   114→\n   115→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   116→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   117→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   118→  ```ts\n   119→  build: {\n   120→    sourcemap: true,\n   121→    minify: false,\n   122→  },\n   123→  define: {\n   124→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   125→  },\n   126→  ```\n   127→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   128→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   129→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   130→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   131→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   132→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   133→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   134→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   135→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   136→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   137→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   138→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   139→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   140→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   141→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   142→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   143→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   144→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   145→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   146→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   147→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   148→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   149→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   150→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   151→\n   152→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   153→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   154→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   155→\n   156→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   157→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   158→\n   159→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   160→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   161→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   162→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   163→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   164→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_019ASLF9TmabKQ9ujfhJ37p4","session_id":"08e4eb64-0001-4076-b414-5268e401dc39","uuid":"422da9ea-bb74-460c-9de5-531a9e275e17"}

Let me analyze the two violations:\n\n### Subtask 1: FixViolationMissingEndpointTestEntries\n\nThe testSpec.md directive says:\n> For apps that expose backend API endpoints (webhooks, serverless functions, etc.), the test specification must include entries that verify the endpoints actually function correctly — not just that their documentation or help UI is accurate. Test entries should cover calling each endpoint with valid inputs and verifying the expected side effects (e.g., database records created or updated, status transitions completed, downstream processes triggered).\n\nLooking at the current tests.md, I can see that:\n- There IS a test for `spawn-container` endpoint: \"ActiveContainers: Shows pending container after spawn\" which calls POST to spawn-container and verifies the container appears in the UI.\n\n\n- There's no test entry for the `app-builder-event` endpoint that verifies events actually appear in the WebhookEventFeed, and no test for `set-default-prompt` that confirms it updates the DefaultPromptDisplay.\n\nI need to add test spec entries for these two missing endpoints.\n\n### Subtask 2: FixViolationMissingStatusStyles\n\nLooking at ActiveContainers.css, I see styles defined for `--starting`, `--alive`, and `--finished`, but the test spec mentions a \"started\" status that doesn't have corresponding styling.\n\nThe Playwright test at line 172 is checking for `active-containers__status--started`, and there's also a test for \"pending\" containers, but the CSS is missing both `--started` and `--pending` variants. I need to add those style definitions to match what the tests expect.\n\nThe existing test file already has a test that calls the spawn-container endpoint directly, but there are no tests verifying that the app-builder-event and set-default-prompt endpoints actually trigger UI updates. I'll add those test entries and fix the missing CSS variants.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11209,"cache_read_input_tokens":50189,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11209,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"08e4eb64-0001-4076-b414-5268e401dc39","uuid":"83c5ca45-918a-4942-9a6d-3b8e231ef50b"}

apps).\n\n**StatusFilter: Switch to Finished tab**\nGiven the user is on MainPage with the \"Building\" tab selected,\nwhen the user clicks the \"Finished\" tab,\nthe \"Finished\" tab becomes selected (blue highlighted background) and \"Building\" becomes unselected.\nThe AppCardGrid updates to show only apps with status \"Finished\" (recently completed apps).\nApps that were visible under \"Building\" are no longer shown.\n\n**StatusFilter: Switch to Queued tab**\nGiven the user is on MainPage with the \"Building\" tab selected,\nwhen the user clicks the \"Queued\" tab,\nthe \"Queued\" tab becomes selected (blue highlighted background) and \"Building\" becomes unselected.\nThe AppCardGrid updates to show only apps with status \"Queued\" (apps waiting to be built).\nApps that were visible under \"Building\" are no longer shown.\n\n**StatusFilter: Switch between all tabs preserves correct filter**\nGiven the user is on MainPage,\nwhen the user clicks \"Finished\", then clicks \"Queued\", then clicks \"Building\",\neach tab click updates the selected tab styling and the AppCardGrid shows only apps matching the selected status.\nOnly one tab is active at a time.\n\n**StatusFilter: Empty state when no apps match filter**\nGiven the user is on MainPage and there are no apps with status \"Queued\",\nwhen the user clicks the \"Queued\" tab,\nthe tab becomes selected and the AppCardGrid area displays an empty state (no app cards shown).\nThe StatusFilter remains functional and the user can switch to other tabs.\n\n### RequestAppCTA\n\n**RequestAppCTA: Visible below StatusFilter**\nGiven the user navigates to MainPage (/),\nthe \"Request an app\" CTA is visible as a prominent full-width button with a blue gradient background, positioned between the StatusFilter and the AppCardGrid.\nThe button text reads \"Request an app\".\n\n**RequestAppCTA: Navigates to RequestPage on click**\nGiven the user is on MainPage,\nwhen the user clicks the \"Request

StatusFilter and the AppCardGrid.\nIt does not disappear or move when the filter changes.\n\n### AppCard\n\n**AppCard: Displays title and description**\nGiven there is an app with title \"Inventory Management System\" and description \"Autonomous system to track and order stock in real-time, integrating with suppliers and sales data.\",\nwhen the MainPage loads and the app matches the selected filter,\nthe AppCard displays the app title in bold and the description text below it.\n\n**AppCard: Shows progress bar with percentage for Building apps**\nGiven there is an app with status \"Building\" and build progress at 65%,\nwhen the MainPage loads with the \"Building\" filter selected,\nthe AppCard displays a horizontal progress bar at the top of the card.\nThe progress bar shows a blue filled portion proportional to 65% on a gray track.\nNext to the progress bar, the text \"65% Building\" is displayed.\n\n**AppCard: Shows progress bar at 100% for Finished apps**\nGiven there is an app with status \"Finished\",\nwhen the MainPage loads with the \"Finished\" filter selected,\nthe AppCard displays a progress bar filled to 100% and the status text indicates \"Finished\" (e.g., \"100% Finished\").\n\n**AppCard: Shows progress bar at 0% for Queued apps**\nGiven there is an app with status \"Queued\",\nwhen the MainPage loads with the \"Queued\" filter selected,\nthe AppCard displays a progress bar with 0% fill and the status text indicates \"Queued\" (e.g., \"0% Queued\").\n\n**AppCard: View App button navigates to AppPage**\nGiven the user is on MainPage and an AppCard is visible for an app with id \"inventory-management\",\nwhen the user clicks the blue \"View App\" button on that card,\nthe app navigates to the AppPage at /apps/inventory-management.\n\n**AppCard: Displays app route path next to View App button**\nGiven an AppCard is displayed for an app with id \"inventory-management\",\nthe card shows the route path

matching the selected filter,\nwhen the MainPage loads,\nthe AppCardGrid displays AppCards in a 2-column grid layout.\nCards fill left-to-right, top-to-bottom (first card top-left, second card top-right, third card bottom-left, etc.).\n\n**AppCardGrid: Filters cards based on StatusFilter selection**\nGiven there are apps in all three states (Building, Finished, Queued),\nwhen the user selects \"Building\" in the StatusFilter,\nthe AppCardGrid shows only apps with status \"Building\".\nWhen the user switches to \"Finished\", only finished apps are shown.\nWhen the user switches to \"Queued\", only queued apps are shown.\n\n**AppCardGrid: Empty state when no apps match filter**\nGiven there are no apps with status \"Queued\",\nwhen the user selects the \"Queued\" tab in the

This seems like the test output is being parsed from `test-results/results.json` but the recordings metadata section shows all passed.\n\nWait - I see the issue. The `parsePlaywrightResults()` function reads from `test-results/results.json`, but the actual test results might show 0 because the JSON reporter output has a different format or the file doesn't exist.\n\nBut then it says the exit code is 0 (`playwrightExitCode = pw.status ?? 1`) which means Playwright succeeded. \n\nSo the tests actually passed with exit code 0, but the results parser couldn't find or properly read the `test-results/results.json` file, which is why it's showing 0 tests instead of the actual count. see logs/test-run-17.log` which means the Playwright process failed but no test counts were captured. Looking at the recordings metadata, I see test entries with empty titles and spec files marked as passed, but the results JSON shows 0 tests — so either the JSON wasn't written correctly or the reporter format doesn't match what the parser expects. Wait, the outer process exit code was 0, but the log shows the error suffix, which only appears when `playwrightExitCode !== 0`. Let me trace through this more carefully. The recordings might be from a previous run since `removeRecordings()` only deletes the files, not the accumulated log entries in `~/.replay/recordings.log`. The real problem is that Playwright found 0 tests, which suggests the test file either wasn't found or failed to compile.\n\nLooking at the empty stdout and stderr from the Playwright run, something went wrong silently—either the test files weren't discovered, there was a build error, or the process terminated unexpectedly. Let me check the Playwright configuration to see if there's a path or setup issue.","signature":"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

The Replay Chromium configuration might have an issue. Let me check if the tests are even being found.\n\nActually, I think the `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` might be setting the project to only run with Replay Chromium, but there's some configuration issue. Let me look at this differently and just use the `npm run test` approach since those tests seemed to succeed (the recordings all showed \"passed\").\n\nWait, actually all the recordings showed \"passed\" with empty titles. These might be from old runs. Let me check more carefully.\n\nThe main issue is: the test script ran, Playwright produced no output (empty stdout/stderr), and the results.json parsed to 0 tests. \n\nSo Playwright isn't actually running any tests at all. The `--list` flag is showing that no projects are configured to run with Replay Chromium, which explains why there's no test output. I need to try running this with more verbose output to see what's happening.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":173,"cache_read_input_tokens":76806,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":173,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"08e4eb64-0001-4076-b414-5268e401dc39","uuid":"8c64c812-b98f-44ae-bf64-3e1ecf9c3dfc"}
