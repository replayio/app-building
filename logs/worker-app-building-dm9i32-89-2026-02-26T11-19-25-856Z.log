This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

I already have it from the read above (lines 118-332).\n\nLet me now systematically check each directive.\n\n### Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecDashboardPage - testSpec.md directives\n\n\nThe key directives I need to verify are: maintain consistent styling and navigation across pages, comprehensively test every visible element in the mockups including headers, filters, buttons, and badges, and implement exactly what the mockup shows rather than substituting simpler alternatives—especially for columns requiring joins or computed values.\n\nFor interactive elements, I need to specify exact navigation targets and action results, including how external flows like OAuth or payments open and what happens on completion. Any data mutations require tests confirming persistence and correct side effects without duplicates. Button appearance—text, icons, styling—must match the mockup exactly, and modal dialogs need thorough testing. I should also verify attachment handling and any other interactive features shown in the designs.\n\nImport and upload dialogs need to document expected formats and required fields upfront, while backend integrations like webhooks or API connections must have complete setup instructions visible in the UI. State-changing actions should trigger appropriate updates elsewhere in the app—timeline entries for tracked mutations, and automatic reciprocal updates for symmetrical relationships.\n\nNow I'm going through the DashboardPage test entries systematically, starting with its three main sections.\n\nFor QuickActions, the test entries cover displaying the heading and buttons with proper icons and positioning, opening dialogs for creating suppliers and purchase orders with all fields and defaults specified, verifying that saves persist and update the dashboard, and checking that cancellations don't create records. I'm also checking validation behavior for the create supplier dialog.\n\nNow I'm looking at a potential gap in the test coverage around Directive 5 — when creating a new order through the dialog, should a history entry be automatically generated? The existing tests verify the order appears in the UpcomingOrdersTable, but based on the OrderHistory test entries that track status changes and line item modifications, the order creation itself should probably create an initial history entry like \"Order Created by [user]\". Looking at the side effects more carefully—when an order is created, a history entry gets generated automatically, which is already tested in the OrderDetailsPage section. The question is whether the DashboardPage test for \"Create Order via Dialog\" needs to explicitly call this out, or if testing it once in the OrderHistory tests is sufficient per directive 5.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the modal dialogs are fully tested according to directive 7. The \"Add New Supplier\" dialog covers opening, saving, canceling, and validation. For the \"Create Purchase Order\" dialog, I need to verify it has the same coverage.\n\nLooking at the test entries, there's some ambiguity around whether closing via the X button is distinct from clicking Cancel, and I notice the creation dialog mentions an initial line item section but doesn't explicitly test adding multiple line items—though that functionality is covered in the OrderDetailsPage tests. I should check the AppSpec to see if the dialog itself needs to support adding multiple items during creation.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the UpcomingOrdersTable coverage—the heading, table structure, data rows, navigation, styling, status badges, and both individual and combined filters all have test entries, plus empty states for no matches and no orders. Currency and date formatting are also covered. Moving into the SuppliersList section, I see tests for the heading, grid layout, name display, and status badges on each card, though the list appears to continue.\n\nThe SuppliersList cards also include contact information, order summaries, and navigation to supplier details, with multiple cards and an empty state all accounted for. Now I'm checking the AppSpec against the mockup to identify any untested

Let me also look at the TopNavBar to check for the duplicate links issue since it has a separate task already queued. Let me also look at the mockup image to see if there are any elements missing from the test spec.\n\nLet me now systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecDashboardPage - testSpec.md directives\n\nLet me go through each test entry group and check against the testSpec.md directives:\n\n### QuickActions Section\n\n**Directive: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup**\n\nI should check the mockup to see if all elements are tested. \n\nSince I can't access the mockup image directly, I'll work from the AppSpec description which lists the Quick action buttons for adding a supplier or order, the upcoming orders list, and the suppliers list. Going through the test entries, I can see they cover the Quick Actions heading, the Add New Supplier button with its icon and position, the Create Purchase Order button with its specifications, the dialog that opens when adding a new supplier with all its fields and defaults, and the Create Purchase Order functionality.\n\nThe test entries verify that creating a supplier through the dialog saves it and updates the dashboard with the new supplier appearing in the list, that canceling the dialog doesn't create anything, and that validation works. Similarly, they check that the Create Purchase Order button opens the right dialog with all fields specified, that creating an order saves and updates the dashboard, and that canceling doesn't create an order. The validation for both dialogs is also covered.\n\nI'm checking that every clickable element has a test entry specifying its exact navigation target or action result, and all the buttons do specify their exact outcomes. I also need to verify that for any user action that mutates data, there are test entries confirming the change persists.\n\nFor creating an order, I notice it might have a side effect of creating a history entry in the OrderHistory section, but that's already tested in the OrderHistory section itself where \"Order Created\" entries are verified, so I think that's acceptable since the side effects are covered in the relevant page section. The modal dialogs for both adding a supplier and creating an order are tested for opening, filling, saving, canceling, and validation.\n\nThe button appearance requirements are also covered—the Add New Supplier button has the person-plus icon on the left, and the Create Purchase Order button has the document icon on the right next to it.\n\nNow I'm checking the UpcomingOrdersTable section, which needs to verify the heading, all five columns, the order data rows with exact values, that Order ID links navigate to the correct details page with proper styling, and that status badges display with the right colors.\n\nThe filters are working as expected—both the status and supplier dropdowns test selecting and clearing individually, plus applying them together to check the intersection logic and clearing behavior.\n\nI'm also verifying the empty states display correctly when no orders match the filters or when there are no upcoming orders at all, and that currency and date formatting are applied properly in their respective columns.\n\nMoving into the SuppliersList section now, checking that the heading displays, the supplier cards render in a grid with up to four per row, and each card shows the supplier information correctly. I'm not seeing any violations of the testSpec.md directives for the DashboardPage tests—the supplier creation flow is covered by the grid appearance test, and the navigation is handled separately. Now I need to check whether the DashboardPage components align with the writeApp.md directives.\n\nLooking at the component requirements, I need to verify that each component has proper `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements and containers. Checking QuickActions.tsx, I can see it has the main container and heading test IDs...\n\nChecking component test IDs... Continuing through the rest of the test IDs for the order form fields and their validation states...\n\nNow I'm verifying the UpcomingOrdersTable component has all its test identifiers in place, including the main table wrapper, heading, and the filter controls for status and supplier. I've verified all the test IDs for the SuppliersList component are in place, and the DashboardPage looks good too. Now I'm checking some configuration directives—there's a note about adding a base path to netlify.toml for monorepo setups, though that's not directly relevant to the component testing. I'm also seeing something about the neon serverless driver that seems to be cut off.\n\nLooking at the modal and navigation directives, the Create Order modal is already using SearchableSelect for suppliers, which is correct. There's a known issue flagged for duplicate navigation links in the TopNavBar, but that's separate from DashboardPage. For the filter controls, I'm confirming that QuickActions and UpcomingOrdersTable are both using custom dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, so that's all compliant.\n\nNow checking the remaining directives: there's no attachment functionality on DashboardPage, so those directives don't apply here. The page root element has the correct padding applied. For the component layout-agnostic requirement, QuickActions looks good with no outer padding, but I need to verify that UpcomingOrdersTable isn't adding any padding or margins to its root element.\n\nMoving on to the test directives now. I'm verifying that the DashboardPage tests properly assert navigation targets — checking that clicking order IDs navigates to the correct order details URL, and that supplier card clicks navigate to the right supplier details page.\n\nThe tests also need to verify side effects from create actions, like confirming that new suppliers appear in the grid and new orders show up in the table after being created through dialogs.\n\nI'm also checking the guidance around `getByText()` to make sure we're not using overly generic text selectors that could match unintended elements.\n\nLooking at the test files, they're consistently using `getByTestId` throughout, which is the right approach, and the `data-testid` values match what's defined in the components themselves.\n\nI don't see any `.toPass()` retry blocks being misused with Playwright locators, and the `beforeEach` hooks are doing what they need to—navigating and waiting for visibility without unnecessary cleanup.\n\nThe timeout values look reasonable overall—most visibility checks use 30 seconds, while local UI events like modal appearances use shorter timeouts of 5-15 seconds, which makes sense given they don't depend on backend calls.\n\nBoth tests that chain multiple user flows have `test.slow()` marked, and every field mentioned in the test spec is actually being exercised with proper actions and assertions.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the tests rely on fixed record counts in the database, which would violate the directive about not assuming a specific total count.\n\nLooking at the cancel dialog test, it captures the initial supplier card count and then verifies the count hasn't changed after canceling—that's a relative comparison, not a fixed assumption. The grid layout test uses `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual` for a flexible assertion. The multiple cards test is checking...\n\nActually, I'm second-guessing the fixed count of 2 for \"Apex Logistics\" cards. The directive allows asserting on specific records by name, which this does with the `hasText` filter, so that should be acceptable. And since the other test in the file creates \"New Parts Co.\" not \"Apex Logistics,\" there's no conflict with the seed data count.\n\nNow looking at the \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\" test more carefully—it captures an initial count outside the retry block and then asserts against that baseline, which aligns with the directive since the `count()` call itself isn't wrapped in `.toPass()`. The real consideration is that tests within the same file share a database branch, so execution order matters. If the create test runs first and persists \"New Parts Co.,\" the cancel test will get a higher initial count, but that's fine since it's comparing against whatever that baseline is rather than expecting a fixed number.\n\nFor the \"Multiple Supplier Cards Displayed\" test in the other spec file, it's asserting exactly 2 \"Apex Logistics\" cards, which appears to be seed data. This would only break if another test creates a duplicate \"Apex Logistics\" supplier, which seems unlikely given the test structure. I should verify one more detail about the DashboardPage implementation to be thorough.\n\nThe testSpec.md guidelines emphasize not substituting simpler elements for what the mockup shows and systematically inventorying every visible element. Looking at the AppSpec description, the DashboardPage covers quick action buttons, an upcoming orders list with the required columns, and a suppliers list with the expected fields. Since I can't reliably view the mockup image, I'm working from the AppSpec description to confirm coverage.\n\nI notice the TopNavBar has a known issue with duplicate navigation links, but that's a component-level problem rather than specific to the DashboardPage itself. Let me double-check if there's anything else I might have missed before finalizing my assessment.\n\nActually, I should reconsider the writeTests.md requirement about verifying side effects. The order creation test doesn't check whether a history entry gets created, even though the OrderHistory tests show that order creation does produce one. That said, it's probably fine since the history entry verification is already covered in the OrderDetailsPage tests, and the DashboardPage test is focused on the dashboard-specific effects like the order appearing in the table. The same logic applies to the supplier creation test. the test entry doesn't explicitly call out the history entry creation, which seems like an oversight given the testSpec.md requirement that test entries verify side effects for data-mutating actions. I need to decide whether the test entry should be updated to include this verification or if it's acceptable to leave it to the implementation test. Looking at similar patterns in other apps like SalesCRM, it seems missing timeline or notification entries does count as a violation. So the \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" test entry should explicitly mention that an OrderHistory entry gets created. For suppliers though, there's no timeline feature in the SupplierDetailsPage, so no history side effect is expected there. Now I need to check the backend code to confirm whether creating an order actually generates a history

The test entry \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" in tests.md doesn't mention this side effect.\n\nLet me check the testSpec.md directive again:\n\"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\"\n\nThis is a violation: the \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" test entry should mention that a history entry is created for the new order.\n\n\nThe writeTests.md directive also requires assertions for side effects like history entries, verifying they occur exactly once to catch duplicate entries from redundant API calls. The actual test in dashboard-quick-actions.spec.ts doesn't verify the history entry either, so both the test entry and the test implementation are incomplete. Since they stem from the same oversight—missing the history side effect—I should flag this as a single combined issue rather than two separate violations. Let me think about what fix task to create. The test entry in tests.md should be updated to mention that an order history entry is created, and the Playwright test should be updated to verify it. These are related fixes from the same root cause.\n\nActually wait, let me reconsider. The testSpec.md directive talks about test entries (docs/tests.md), while the writeTests.md directive talks about Playwright tests. They're checking different things. But the fix for both is:\n1. Update the test entry in tests.md to mention the history side effect\n2. Update the Playwright test to verify the history side effect\n\nThese should be in the same fix task since they share the same root cause.\n\nNow, let me also think about the \"Create Supplier via Dialog\" action. Does creating a supplier have any side effects?

No history/timeline entries are created. This makes sense since the SupplierDetailsPage doesn't have a history section. So no violation for supplier creation.\n\nFor order creation (orders.ts POST handler, lines 75-161), the backend does create a history entry (lines 130-139: \"Order PO-XXXXXX created\"). The \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" test entry in tests.md doesn't mention this side effect, and the corresponding Playwright test doesn't verify it.\n\nThis is a testSpec.md directive violation for the test entry and a writeTests.md directive violation for the Playwright test.\n\n\nI should avoid getting sidetracked by styling details or other potential issues. Let me focus on what I've already identified and check if there are any other clear violations I've missed.\n\nLooking back at the writeApp.md directives, most of them are either build-related, backend-specific, or things I've already verified. The key one for the DashboardPage components is ensuring all test entry requirements are actually satisfied by the code. I need to verify the CSS files to ensure components don't have outer padding, and then double-check that the supplier modal implementation matches the test requirements — it looks like all the fields and defaults are there, so I should confirm the \"Create\" test entry is also satisfied. The save handler dispatches createOrder and then fetchOrders to refresh the table ✓. The order displays with the assigned ID, supplier, expected delivery date, status, and total cost ✓. I need to verify that the backend sets a default \"Pending\" status when creating an order, since the test expects that specific status.\n\nLooking at my findings, there's a violation in the test specification: the \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" test entry doesn't account for the OrderHistory side effect that the backend creates when a new order is posted. The orders.ts POST handler generates a history entry with the message \"Order <OrderId> created\", but the test only verifies that the order appears in the UpcomingOrdersTable. According to the testSpec.md directive about mutating data, the test should verify all side effects are persisted correctly.\n\nThe Playwright test has the same issue—it doesn't assert that the history entry was created. Since both violations stem from the same oversight, I can address them with a single fix that updates both the test entry and the actual test to verify the history side effect. The directive is explicit that mutation tests should verify side effects directly, not rely on them being tested elsewhere. Even though the \"Display All History Entries\" test does confirm that order creation produces a history entry, the test entry for \"Create Order via Dialog\" itself should document this side effect. This is a genuine violation that needs fixing, similar to patterns flagged in the SalesCRM app. The distinction is that the seed data test validates history exists for pre-loaded orders, but there's no explicit test confirming that the CREATE ORDER action itself generates a history entry. The \"History Entry Created on Status Change\" and \"History Entry Created on Line Item Modification\" tests cover those mutations, but order creation is missing. Since the creation happens on DashboardPage but displays on OrderDetailsPage, I should flag this violation against the DashboardPage's \"Create Order via Dialog\" test and then handle the OrderDetailsPage verification separately.\n\nNow I need to create a fix task that updates the test entry in tests.md to document the history side effect and modifies the Playwright test to navigate to the created order and verify the history entry exists.
