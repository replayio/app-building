Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly.

NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

WriteComponentFilters: Write the Filters component\n4. WritePageTodoList: Write the page itself\n\nThese are the subtasks after the setup tasks (SetupApp, DesignDatabase). So the app should already be set up. Let me check if there's already a setup including the database, build system, etc. But the app directory only has AppSpec.md and docs. That seems like the setup hasn't been done.\n\n\nLooking back at the task description, the setup and database design were presumably completed in earlier tasks, but the directory structure suggests otherwise. Let me check the git history to see what's actually been done.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":435,"cache_read_input_tokens":34258,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":435,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2285ae38-69f9-4b74-87a1-8a664ceeb263","uuid":"d7184455-85f1-4d1a-a86c-30396237483d"}

This means the setup hasn't been done yet! The app directory is nearly empty - it only has AppSpec.md and docs/.\n\nWait, but the subtasks I was given are:\n1. WriteComponentHeader: Write the Header component\n2. WriteComponentTodoList: Write the TodoList component\n3. WriteComponentFilters: Write the Filters component\n4. WritePageTodoList: Write the page itself\n\nThese are my assigned tasks. But the app hasn't been set up yet - there's no package.json, no Vite config, no source directory, no database schema, etc.\n\n\nI'm realizing the task queue has things backwards - SetupApp and DesignDatabase should come first, but my instructions are clear that I can only work on the subtasks assigned to me. Since the app structure doesn't exist yet, I'll need to set it up as part of writing these components. Let me check if there are other apps in the repo that show the typical structure I should follow.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1938,"cache_read_input_tokens":34693,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1938,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2285ae38-69f9-4b74-87a1-8a664ceeb263","uuid":"0d88e23d-701a-4318-957a-76564cba5cf6"}
