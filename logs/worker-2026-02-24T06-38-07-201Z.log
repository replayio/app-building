Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5e5af855-f8b5-4faa-8470-bf0544f43eff","uuid":"15a6b630-8d6a-4af0-839f-ce0be54f377a","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

Focus on completing the\n    38→jobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    39→\n    40→When you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    41→\n    42→## Job System\n    43→\n    44→Work is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\n    45→with a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\n    46→and a `timestamp`:\n    47→\n    48→```json\n    49→{\n    50→  \"groups\": [\n    51→    {\n    52→      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    53→      \"jobs\": [\n    54→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    55→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    57→      ],\n    58→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    59→    }\n    60→  ]\n    61→}\n    62→```\n    63→\n    64→The agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n    65→\n    66→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n    67→  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n    68→  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n    69→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    70→\n    71→All jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\n    72→all checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\n    73→sub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    74→\n    75→**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n    76→\n    77→- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    78→  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    79→- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n    80→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    81→- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n    82→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    83→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n    84→- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n    85→\n    86→## Tech Stack\n    87→\n    88→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    89→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    90→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    91→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    92→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    93→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    94→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    95→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    96→\n    97→## Database\n    98→\n    99→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   100→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   101→frontend components.\n   102→\n   103→## Quality Gates\n   104→\n   105→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   106→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   107→\n   108→## Commits\n   109→\n   110→The worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\n   111→explicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n   112→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01MSgTBB3ieRfJPyWmGUc79G","session_id":"5e5af855-f8b5-4faa-8470-bf0544f43eff","uuid":"9515cbd0-0485-4c5a-ae29-78e229b99113"}

image, \"David L.\" as the abbreviated name, and \"(Sales)\" as the role\n\n#### Test: Tasks are ordered by due date with soonest first\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page is loaded with multiple tasks with different due dates\n- **Then** tasks are displayed in chronological order with the soonest due date at the top (e.g., \"Due: Today\" before \"Due: Tomorrow\" before \"Due: Oct 25, 2024\")\n\n#### Test: Action menu opens with options\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page shows task cards\n- **When** the user clicks the \"...\" action menu on a task card (e.g., \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\")\n- **Then** a dropdown menu appears with options such as \"View Details\", \"Edit\", \"Mark as Complete\", \"Delete\"\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"View Details\" navigates to associated client detail page\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\" which is associated with client \"Acme Corp\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"View Details\"\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for \"Acme Corp\"\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Edit\" opens task edit dialog\n- **Given** the action menu is open for a task\n- **When** the user clicks \"Edit\"\n- **Then** an edit dialog opens pre-populated with the task's current data (name, due date, priority, assignee, client, deal)\n- **When** the user changes the priority from \"High\" to \"Medium\" and saves\n- **Then** the task card updates to show a yellow \"Medium\" priority badge instead of the red \"High\" badge\n- **And** the change is persisted to the database\n- **And** the updated priority is also reflected in the associated client's Tasks section on the Client Detail Page\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Edit\" dialog can be cancelled\n- **Given** the edit

original values\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Mark as Complete\" completes the task\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"Mark as Complete\"\n- **Then** the task is marked as completed\n- **And** the task is removed from the \"Upcoming Tasks\" list (or displayed with a completed visual style such as strikethrough)\n- **And** the task's completed status is reflected on the associated client's Tasks section on the Client Detail Page\n- **And** if the task is linked to a deal, the task's completed status is also reflected in the deal's Linked Tasks section\n- **And** a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline recording the task completion (e.g., \"Task Completed: 'Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan'\")\n\n#### Test: Action menu \"Delete\" removes task with confirmation\n- **Given** the action menu is open for task \"Prepare Weekly Status Report\"\n- **When** the user clicks \"Delete\"\n- **Then** a confirmation dialog appears (e.g., \"Are you sure you want to delete this task?\")\n- **When** the user confirms deletion\n- **Then** the task is removed from the tasks list\n- **And** the task is also removed from the associated client's Tasks section\n- **And** if linked to a deal, the task is removed from the deal's Linked Tasks section\n- **And** a timeline entry is created on the associated client's timeline recording the task deletion\n- **When** the user cancels deletion\n- **Then** the task remains in the list\n\n#### Test: Task list shows empty state when no tasks exist\n- **Given** there are no upcoming tasks in the system\n- **Then** the tasks list shows an empty state message (e.g., \"No upcoming tasks. Create a new task to get started.\")\n- **And** there may be a call-to-action button to create a task\n\n#### Test: Clicking a task card navigates to associated client detail page\n- **Given** the Tasks List Page shows a task card for \"Review Client Proposal Draft\" associated with client \"Globex Solutions\"\n- **When** the user clicks on the task card (on the task name area)\n- **Then** the app navigates to the Client Detail Page (/clients/:clientId) for \"Globex Solutions\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## File 4: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md`\n\nThis file does **not exist** at `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md`.\n\n---\n\nThat completes the full contents of all requested files.

The outer container (`.ezxFuW`) is a single-column grid where each child is a full-width row.\n\n```css\n/* Outer list container */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* single column, full-width rows */\ngrid-template-rows: 36px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 308px;\n                  /* ^group header  ^issue rows...                              ^spacer */\n```\n\n- **Group header row**: 36px tall\n- **Issue row**: 44px tall\n- The list container has 14 children: 1 group header + 12 issue rows + 1 spacer\n\n### Issue Row Structure\n\nEach issue row is an `<a>` tag (the full row is clickable) wrapping an inner grid `<div>` with **7 named grid columns**:\n\n| Column       | Content Example          | Font Size | Font Weight | Color             |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `checkbox`   | (empty/checkbox)         | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `priority`   | (priority icon)          | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `identifier` | \"PRO-1247\", \"TT-38\"     | 13px      | 450         | rgb(91, 91, 93)   |\n| `status`     | (status icon)            | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `title`      | \"Contact form not working\" | 13px    | 500         | rgb(26, 26, 26)   |\n| `created`    | (date/avatar info)       | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n| (additional) | (assignee, labels, etc.) | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n\nKey observations:\n- **Identifier** uses muted color `rgb(91, 91, 93)` / `#5b5b5d` with semi-bold weight 450\n- **Title** uses primary color `rgb(26, 26, 26)` / `#1a1a1a` with medium weight 500\n- Both use 13px font size (not the body 16px)\n- The grid uses **named column tracks** (`checkbox`, `priority`, `identifier`, `status`, `title`, `created`) for semantic column placement\n\n### Issue Row Styling\n\n```css\n/* Issue row (A tag) */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-column: 1 / -1;      /* spans full width */\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 44px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nborder: none;              /* 0px none — no visible row borders */\ncursor: default;\ntext-decoration: none;     /* no underline on the link */\noutline: none;             /* focus-visible override */\n```\n\n### Row Separation\n\nRows have **no visible borders** between them. Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nfont-size: 16px;\nfont-weight: 400;\n```\n\nGroup headers contain section names (e.g., \"Other active\") with a count badge (\"19\").\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —         |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`  | ~6% black |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(239, 239, 239)`     | `#efefef` |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(245, 245, 245)`     | `#f5f5f5` |\n| Alt hover (mid)   | `rgb(247, 247, 247)`     | `#f7f7f7` |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(237, 237, 237)`     | `#ededed` |\n\nAll hover backgrounds observed in stylesheets:\n- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)` — primary interactive hover\n- `rgb(239, 239, 239)` — pressed/active\n- `rgb(245, 245, 245)` — sidebar hover\n- `rgb(247, 247, 247)` — light hover\n- `rgb(237, 237, 237)` — selected state\n- `transparent` — reset/clear hover\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: var(--control-border-radius, 4px);\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(45, 46, 47);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background         | Description                |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Default | transparent        | No background              |\n| Hover   | rgb(247, 247, 247) | `#f7f7f7` — subtle gray    |\n| Active  | rgb(238, 238, 238) | `#eeeeee` — slightly darker|\n\nThe hover transition uses `var(--speed-highlightFadeIn)` for a fast, smooth appearance.\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n| `1px solid var(--gray4)`             | Subtle separators        |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#dcdcdc`.\nHover border uses `var(--normal-border-hover)` and `var(--gray5)` for a slightly darker state.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value                              | Usage                     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| `var(--control-border-radius)` 4px | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px                                | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px                                | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%                                | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows are very subtle and use low-opacity black. The double shadow on Elevation 2 combines a soft spread with a thin ring for depth + definition.\n\n---\n\n## Transitions\n\n| Property | Duration | Easing       | Usage                    |\n|----------|----------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| opacity  | 0.1s     | ease         | Fast micro-interactions  |\n| opacity  | 0.2s     | ease-out     | Standard fade-in/out     |\n| opacity  | 0.8s     | ease-out     | Delayed entrance effects |\n| fill     | 0.4s     | ease         | Icon color transitions   |\n\nHover highlight uses a CSS variable `--speed-highlightFadeIn` for consistent timing across all interactive elements.\n\n---\n\n## CSS Custom Properties (referenced in stylesheets)\n\n### Backgrounds & Colors\n`--bg-color`, `--bg-sidebar-color`, `--bg-base-color`, `--bg-border-color`, `--content-color-light`, `--content-highlight-color-light`\n\n### Interactive States\n`--normal-bg`, `--normal-border`, `--normal-border-hover`, `--normal-text`, `--speed-highlightFadeIn`\n\n### Sizing\n`--sidebar-width` (244px), `--scrollbar-width` (12px), `--control-border-radius` (4px), `--border-radius`\n\n### Sonner Toast Variables\n`--gray2`, `--gray4`, `--gray5`, `--normal-border-hover`\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles (observed)\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent overlays (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`) rather than bold color changes.\n3. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n4. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with very low opacity for a flat-but-layered feel.\n5. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s-0.2s) for a responsive feel.\n6. **Neutral palette with purple accent**: The UI is predominantly grayscale with purple/blue accents (`#7180ff`) for selections and primary actions.\n7. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n8. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n","numLines":374,"startLine":1,"totalLines":374}}}

Let me analyze what's already there and what needs to be done:\n\n1. **Sidebar** - Already exists with full implementation including nav items, profile dropdown, CSS. Looks complete.\n2. **ClientsSearchAndFilters** - Already exists with search, status, tag, source, sort filters. Looks complete.\n3. **ClientsActions** - Already exists with import, export, and add client functionality. Looks complete.\n4. **ClientsTable** - Already exists with all columns, row actions, edit/delete modals. Looks complete.\n5. **Pagination** - Already exists with page info, prev/next, page numbers. Looks complete.\n\n\n6. **ClientsListPage** - Already exists, composing all the above components. Looks complete.\n\nAll components are fully implemented and match the test specifications. I'm verifying that all data-testid attributes are present, the implementations align with test expectations, and the styling follows the AppStyle.md requirements. The Sidebar checks out with the logo, navigation links with icons, active page highlighting, and profile section all in place.\n\nClientsSearchAndFilters has the search bar, status/tags/source/sort dropdowns with correct defaults, and all required test IDs. ClientsActions includes the import and export buttons with proper icons, plus the primary blue \"Add New Client\" button.\n\nNow I'm working through the ClientsTable component—it needs all seven column headers with client names as clickable links, color-coded status badges, tags as chips, and primary contact info. Each row has an action menu for viewing, editing, and deleting, with corresponding modals for those actions. I'm also handling the empty and loading states with proper test IDs throughout.\n\nThe pagination component displays the current range of clients, includes previous and next buttons with proper disabled states, shows page numbers with ellipsis, and highlights the active page. Everything has the necessary test IDs.\n\nFor the ClientsListPage itself, I'm composing all these subcomponents together with the page header, Redux state management to fetch clients on mount, and the correct padding. Let me double-check the imports to make sure everything's properly connected.\n\nI'm noticing the ClientsSearchAndFilters component uses path aliases like `@/store/hooks`, so I need to verify those are configured in the Vite

Now let me verify the build works by running a type check. Let me check if the ClientsSearchAndFilters imports correctly reference the hooks.\n\nLet me also check if there are import issues with the `@/` prefix in the Sidebar component - it uses a relative import `./Sidebar.css` which is fine, and direct imports from react-router-dom and lucide-react which should be fine too. The `@/store/hooks` in the other components should resolve through the path alias.\n\nActually, wait - the Sidebar.tsx currently imports from `react-router-dom` etc. directly (not `@/` paths). \n\nThat's fine as long as the imports resolve properly. Let me run a type check to see if there are any actual issues with the current setup.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":500,"cache_read_input_tokens":108272,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":500,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5e5af855-f8b5-4faa-8470-bf0544f43eff","uuid":"571b0b8d-2b46-4eef-8a84-d48f241b8b23"}
