Always use the\n    99→  Playwright deployment test config (`playwright.deployment.config.ts`) which runs headless with\n   100→  `@replayio/playwright` and handles browser setup correctly.\n   101→- Do NOT install or start Xvfb. All browsers must run headless. If a browser complains about\n   102→  a missing display, the fix is to ensure it runs headless, not to add a virtual display.\n   103→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   104→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for verifying the deployment. If the\n   105→  upload is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT decide you have \"enough information\"\n   106→  and proceed without the recording — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis cycle.\n   107→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_0124PX87NmVTMFNuEfZyVdNb","session_id":"681c40a1-193f-4fd4-bf2c-7d9971335ba4","uuid":"ea26d177-8659-4ae5-86dc-3ea92b2567fa"}
