This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. For any user action that mutates data, verify change is persisted correctly with right side effects\n\n\n6. Button and control appearance matters — verify appearance, not just existence\n7. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must have tests that other parts update appropriately (timeline/history, reciprocal relationships)\n\nNow I'm going through each RecipeDetailsPage test entry systematically. The page contains RecipeDetailHeader, DescriptionCard, ProductsOutputTable, RawMaterialsCard, and EquipmentRequiredList components.\n\nFor RecipeDetailHeader, I need to verify the breadcrumb navigation shows \"Recipes > recipe name with ID\", that clicking Recipes navigates back, the page title displays correctly with the recipe ID, and the Edit Recipe button both appears and opens an edit form. The DescriptionCard should display its heading, show the recipe description text, and handle empty descriptions with a placeholder. For ProductsOutputTable, I'm checking that the card heading displays, the table has Product Name and Amount columns, and the rows render properly.\n\nNow I'm verifying the empty products table shows a placeholder, then moving into the RawMaterialsCard to ensure the heading displays, the Material Name and Amount columns are present, raw material data populates the rows, and empty states show placeholders. For EquipmentRequiredList, I need to confirm the heading appears, equipment items display with their link icons, names and IDs, and that clicking any equipment link navigates to its corresponding details page. IP-5: Empty equipment list shows placeholder\n\nLet me check each test entry against the directives:\n\n**Directive: For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result.**\n- RD-HDR-2: \"the app navigates to /recipes\" ✓ \n- RD-HDR-5: \"a modal or form is displayed pre-filled...\" ✓ specifies what happens\n- RD-EQUIP-3: \"the app navigates to /equipment/E-101\" ✓\n- RD-EQUIP-4: \"the app navigates to /equipment/C-205\" and \"/equipment/D-402\" ✓\n\n**Directive: For any user action that mutates data, verify change is persisted correctly.**\n- RD-HDR-5: \"the change persists after navigating away and returning\" ✓\n\n**Directive: Button and control appearance matters.**\n- RD-HDR-4 specifies the blue 'Edit Recipe' button positioned to the right ✓\n- RD-EQUIP-2 covers the link icon, clickable equipment name, and ID display ✓\n\n**Directive: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.**\n- RD-HDR-5 tests opening the edit modal, but I don't see a test for closing or cancelling it, which seems like a gap in modal coverage.\n\n**Directive: Systematically inventory every visible element.**\n- I should cross-reference the mockup against the AppSpec to identify any missing elements.","signature":"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

The main layout is a calendar (daily/weekly/monthly views) showing each scheduled production run as an event or block. Users can click on a date to create a new production run or select an existing run to open its details page or modal. Each event shows key info such as product/recipe name, quantity, and status. The page includes navigation controls to move between weeks/months, and may integrate data from external inventory and delivery scheduling apps to visually indicate availability constraints (e.g., color coding runs with material shortages). Drag-and-drop or editing of events may be used to reschedule runs. This page is the central hub for planning when production runs occur.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdTvUTHD7IfSRxAhcbzPKXQNjVd4MGOspvJ9t0\n    13→\n    14→3.

(2) Recipe and raw materials section listing each material required, the amount needed for the planned quantity, and units. (3) Forecast/availability section showing projected inventory levels for each material at the time of the run, based on data from the separate inventory tracking and delivery scheduling apps. This may include columns like required amount, forecast available amount, shortage/excess, and any pending delivery details. (4) equipment the run will require and availability.

Let me analyze it carefully:\n\n1. **Navigation bar**: Dashboard, Recipes (highlighted), Equipment, Schedule links\n2. **Breadcrumb**: \"Recipes > High-Performance Polymer Blend (HPP-B1)\"\n3. **Page title**: \"High-Performance Polymer Blend (HPP-B1)\"\n4. **Edit Recipe button**: Blue button on the right\n5. **Description card**: Heading \"Description\" with text content\n6. **Products (Output) card**: Table with \"Product Name\" and \"Amount\" columns, data rows\n\n\n7. **Raw Materials (per batch) card**: Table with \"Material Name\" and \"Amount\" columns, data rows\n8. **Equipment Required card**: List of equipment with link icons, names as clickable links, and IDs in parentheses\n\nNow I'm going through the testSpec.md directives to systematically check each visible element and create test entries for them, making sure I capture all columns, controls, and clickable targets with their exact navigation destinations or action results.\n\nFor the RecipeDetailHeader section, I'm verifying that the breadcrumb displays correctly with proper text and format, the Recipes link navigates to /recipes, the page title matches the expected text, the Edit Recipe button has the right blue appearance, and clicking it opens the modal dialog.\n\nHowever, I notice the modal testing is incomplete—while RD-HDR-5 covers opening and saving, there's no test for cancelling or dismissing the edit recipe modal, which violates the requirement to thoroughly test modal dialogs.\n\nThe DescriptionCard and ProductsOutputTable sections look solid, with tests covering headings, text content, empty states, column headers, and data rows.\n\nNow checking the MaterialsCard—it has all four materials tested across its data rows, plus the heading, column headers, and empty state covered. EquipmentRequiredList is mostly complete too, with tests for the heading, equipment display with icons and IDs, navigation to specific equipment pages, and multiple navigation scenarios, though the empty state test is still missing.\n\nLooking at the mockup against what's been tested, the navigation bar elements appear to be covered in their respective page specs. But I'm noticing a gap in the modal testing—the directive to thoroughly test modal dialogs only has coverage for the save flow in the Edit Recipe modal, not the cancel or close behavior. I should also verify what fields the Edit Recipe modal actually edits to ensure complete coverage. I need to verify that the name change is reflected across the app—the RecipesTable on the RecipesPage should update when a recipe name changes. The test already checks persistence and updates to the title and breadcrumb, which seems sufficient to demonstrate the mechanism works. Looking at how other pages handle modals, like the EquipmentPage's delete confirmation tests, I should add a test entry for cancelling the Edit Recipe modal to fully satisfy the directive about testing modal dialogs. That's the only violation I can identify for RecipeDetailsPage, so now I'm moving on to check Subtask

Systematically inventory every visible element; write a test entry for each\n2. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements\n3. For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result\n4. For data mutations, verify persistence and side effects\n5. Button/control appearance matters — verify appearance\n6. **Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**\n7. State-changing actions must test other parts update\n\n### Checking RecipeDetailHeader entries:\n- **RD-HDR-1**: Breadcrumb format — specifies \"Recipes\" > \"High-Performance Polymer Blend (HPP-B1)\". Matches mockup. ✓\n- **RD-HDR-2**: Breadcrumb navigation — specifies exact target `/recipes`. ✓\n- **RD-HDR-3**: Page title — specifies exact text. ✓\n- **RD-HDR-4**: Edit Recipe button — specifies \"blue\" appearance. Matches mockup. ✓\n- **RD-HDR-5**: Edit Recipe modal — tests opening, pre-filled fields, saving, persistence. ✓\n\n**VIOLATION**: No test entry for **cancelling/dismissing the Edit Recipe modal**.

Matches mockup. ✓\n- **RD-EQUIP-3**: Clicking link navigates to exact target `/equipment/E-101`. ✓\n- **RD-EQUIP-4**: Multiple equipment links navigate to their respective pages. ✓\n- **RD-EQUIP-5**: Empty state placeholder. ✓\n\n**Summary for Subtask 1**: Found 1 violation — missing modal cancel test for Edit Recipe.\n\nAdding a fix task for this violation:"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1489,"cache_read_input_tokens":47800,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1489,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"80e49a7a-2cb3-47cb-b010-6ba16ffca343","uuid":"7f3b740a-e81f-4277-a688-0fd3bf4a7212"}

Always run `npm run check` from the app directory\n2. When working on a component, identify test entries and make sure requirements are satisfied\n3. Match visual appearance to mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, layouts\n4. **All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything E2E tests need to target**\n5. In a monorepo, add `base` to netlify.toml\n6. When using neon serverless driver, use tagged template literal syntax\n\n\n7. For database DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns, convert empty strings to null\n8. Netlify Functions path index for resource ID\n9. When building modals that reference other entities, use searchable select/dropdown\n10. Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links\n11. Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls/dropdowns\n12. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons\n13. Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads\n14. **Every page component must include consistent padding on root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)**\n\nNow I'm checking each component against these requirements, starting with RecipeDetailsPage.tsx to verify it meets the page component padding standards and other directives. line 52 doesn't have padding classes, so I need to check what the `page-content` class actually provides in the CSS. Looking at RecipeDetailHeader, I notice the Cancel button and modal close button are missing `data-testid` attributes, which could be violations of the testing requirements.\n\nNow I'm going through the other components—DescriptionCard, ProductsOutputTable, RawMaterialsCard, and EquipmentRequiredList all have their test IDs properly set on containers, empty states, tables, rows, and individual elements. Let me dig into the CSS to understand the padding directive better.\n\nI'm also checking the custom dropdown requirement—StatusSelect in RecipeDetailHeader is using a custom component, not a native select, which is correct. For EquipmentRequiredList, the mockup shows link icons next to equipment names, but the component's SVG is drawing a beaker or tool icon instead of a chain-link icon.\n\nNow I need to focus on the clear violations, starting with checking if the page root has the proper padding directive applied.","signature":"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

The `page-content` class provides `padding: 24px` (which is equivalent to `p-6` in Tailwind) and on small screens it's `padding: 12px` (equivalent to `p-3`). So the app uses CSS classes instead of Tailwind classes, which is fine.\n\nNow looking at RecipeDetailsPage.tsx again:\n- Line 52: Root `<div>` has no padding class — BUT the `RecipeDetailHeader` (line 53) is outside the `page-content` div\n- Line 54: `<div className=\"page-content\">` wraps the body content\n\n\n- The `RecipeDetailHeader` sits outside `page-content`, so it doesn't inherit that padding, which means the header likely has its own padding or styling applied separately\n\n. Looking at the mockup, the breadcrumb and title appear horizontally aligned with the cards below, suggesting they should share the same padding context. I should check how other detail pages in the app handle this pattern to ensure consistency.","signature":"EssRCkYICxgCKkAm2gf5cueNwKzD/+8JopXT3Xe0lgT+xBq8hBCRK2EQg2goz1UWCOzuyrmkCYYai3OKkhNw/90D1ZL+llSlhmz3EgyvD2QSq8URfFGPoVUaDEKHIyWoh0Ab1JaykSIwEb17Zs64As3uYAOXAxKXe93YSeq8VGoRkucG2XXo2ZSoRGbV6ZE8ZWch8q1YJ0uAKrIQww94fdNBt2Us6ELLMgkYVuirtjpoMuW3aT89Y2ms19I+ZOvNpaG3iv2TPDYHF6h8UfzEYi4qsYfVOMB3+TYVIyigQaKHZlTtCELegUgfrHHlbmTk9eACOgxIkcK9GEDyWau+Z1FG0BRedc4pRW9ZYM34e0KtZb30OadReL0Ah1yJMHM93pXlkVhRDB5GQkB42KO2rvz+YcFO9xMINFWnbsy/WQD+OhbhDSZLkCXz8e6xNTSDia+TsUENbgWkUC1yvMRcJHfyBdzxReuSi72mcr7LeloD+rO6346rVYPS45o3CGkZE0sSfeoe7CS0fJ/iDsh5bLpMlKSqJEHDCbSPdUiPUO6jkvBWdOgoiDCDyrkxtjPLsvLcSTg2N7aeGZ0WQK7dwZsT58WG06ubP4qxe1XvJi84tYBbmxaOcfEhEYhCpqc5ked76a/lfIzxvg9VllLTq1xu+6RNzQ0uJ+X/Am359J4WgY2ZNDETYyVVJWSzHvVJ+Sd6YJVFsSR7+4U57q0GYY440rYIxyeZzjS/DuykiMaaUkQIPvdMRNiQkYxKOWHF2+17z7kcbfavUBEh1a37U5tLwg57OegHqdtlVjYJv64vSuDq5jpAUaNvuWXPsE7j0vNknQKxs+v3SWSO0vxk6mR2DmlRBoiUTpfm+cdXGRQi77d7SYVBm5sO3C9T3OgM+B9GT0+5CHYQwX/BGaaRzyc+2AK9Zaia57H7t0J9uSXzkmRopbqGnc+wdqCfYuTSapO2RqUVqn4STJDhh62O6Xc4GhRLgNcE573792tYUxerTbPBFxdmKe6Hn7w7qGvRRraGfydnM++pM5BPNtQOy1LxtMCm4hzcqH6OvcRQOKpYxIqizNiiOJ53w49pZs3x2VRhb0G4yI00x/3ekuohG7KUloO+wKoOij9yTZ17slv3qS/3VMIxmPHpQXe8Re4e5cf8lz0wXogHPwQNqYE122js+p0pF5sLB/WnrPbs/RSF6ncPxIf2H0c/OT+ZqdcfwkAHLhAXpA/M/Kk0DatQnSShP8a3hHJxbBBgTW/t6CaMbEPpwFdi3S+hfOnjtaSCviiestv+RN8CBUnFn1S9M45Qw2Xl498rwEL/xBFIjDHSMbCByQUnAsTyAHfD4gOVjkO2u3i4ZLFdvcNqPaxjUUndnwTNSUIH9grxXiR2t91z7XIaRsEImbJbvfmapfNFxuR/lCR+gCAU6AFSXVjtUHWkASIEunxzbWQi2sXZ2ZyHQpt9Aisul/4ceT2Kb/xvEl3+JY1njfGV3lhYmkur1SqfQSV0qSznmfIv3flfUSRpsUfIQa6j1avroJjmKlRkT/s3VBQo4MJk6qo0XePTts5tKjF2/9yiE62b8t8hA/1fOBOPJwgRMU5qOW/k7h4UMv1aU6k8m5/tcUmJIYcBGBmZ6UDkUHmHKkBG024waq8oGvpNTxVWWaXS+hCetN57wW71nFYKJ/Rltz2QKN0ZMYLekAmPbwiRTghLFNyDel8XtfmxG2vn68O28qg0mYviXcRmkkWW1cKkLOYZG1VUtOheHLsYTZ51AsdVgdMy9RcBYdcFOScqrs+yFIyZ1YndJ/GLb58qR52Iignb8Vg+XRWKDhYWd5tuZPjU00Jj//06fPpj0dMtOfA2BMe3rUR5ftPYMVGsQwJmIN83kbMxhohYimbO58MW7/6nfCI3nkfa53hk0kr7dsSR3hPxTO4JRGDVd0kQswpnP1qC2cn/VzPhAmxbCo3ZycJTZf+Bf5c/ZKPy7vrvzDvTRk7/SQTcCaSnPCTUal7Rekm7ksYLmWaFOTlQLHVhkOgxuE2A+xbsQLt6zfNay6h6PEM+wF4raEmewrQi+1+TelGm5uwZ+CnrAyQFWB28AMkTnUG2Vky/SYANKO4bU9n0Qd51Xjfa4HqpjM8HgWkh6qk0G18utkDv+0ws27mMpaCVSn2+T6BiARjaYXDrkqcOvuRMQwJD/3v88Tqp3C+hW3CXegFX59pigxiNwga0j2IstYwzgZpTLg1ARX/VV1HU3GeBLV67BVZvLEOaciDk/tCGGazChayPbTPXKFjp51upheOYcjmC1ERIqT0QJw7OXVjtuBPGk5FuIPu6/yTK2U24/ZwVUFppP0fbnMdcV+kwvjDiHUXiUTBY6iwevn+5k+todZQBAnsShSiXhKFaY2fNxOODqm+7KG60dwbfMLjgKU0K0JEKtH0RqlvMb5PVkgQ3YC4UZHH1DYFU+O/Dbsdk4twi0Oz8hWV7ZF3K+9gZvkCOFf4Vs5oxc1PgcQJMNEoOFnJKoFjues/IE9ihA5oMgWdSHinm48tG4/Deq9024TGQRzkqtufd1cRDDjftTZ+qsFkh8mtwtvtQwuBPYYKyKw+mmLR6Wr37fcNPoEE0etaTM0tTFVzmZSvZGj+OHBoc2Boi6Zn9ogqnioq360mWFkpfzxvpNiJXUaX2jweLbZbg/tAyQn/T2866VgQvPCpe3u81p0tOflJC9hZ1gteuhGyioIJl5Bz5cG7uUZYLIqiZGmq6XTDYLUZ9W+bqZHOvp84MHfCm21zUezMTz5TdCYjWomZSJ3aLJD/A1qh0myHeBPkyVpDQn20acsSeuE3mJdA86pPdoNKvYIDZr/bMJQMIFkRykEC1eAN9kM5/CXWuZNY6layw5pn62+fYsWGlWHn3OtgJcKh7JZeN58sRcxxiLEboOimehiHfoy2rqZ8Yxjfz9Exvn23f+D1uqLwmULgAaJjv1y31R/3jezgcB7m95YAvUM/yb4/FWAVAwAKW0Kg95ToD4H5TizDkBu52wxgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2674,"cache_read_input_tokens":58864,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2674,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"80e49a7a-2cb3-47cb-b010-6ba16ffca343","uuid":"fa9ca8c3-f31f-4b24-bb18-f384fc2008d2"}

On mobile, breadcrumb doesn't change padding (no media query), title row goes to `12px 12px 0`, and page-content goes to `12px`. There's a slight inconsistency on mobile for the breadcrumb (stays at 24px while others go to 12px), but that's in the shared component, not the RecipeDetailsPage itself.\n\n\nThe padding structure is actually applied through CSS classes on child elements rather than directly on the root, which achieves the same effect even if it's not using Tailwind utilities. Now I'm checking the writeApp.md directives for violations—specifically looking at whether interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes. I can already see the EditRecipeModal's Cancel button and close button are missing these identifiers. Looking at the rest of the components, EquipmentRequiredList already has data-testid on its links, while DescriptionCard, ProductsOutputTable, and RawMaterialsCard are display-only with no interactive elements. So the actual violations come down to those two missing testids on the modal's Cancel and close buttons—both part of the same modal component issue.\n\nI'm realizing the fix task I already created for the testSpec.md violation (adding the test entry for dismissing the modal) will naturally require adding those data-testids anyway, so I don't need a separate writeApp.md violation entry for this. I'm realizing the data-testid violations affect both the Cancel and close buttons, but only the Cancel button's test entry is missing from testSpec.md. Since both issues stem from the same incomplete modal implementation, I should keep them in one fix task that covers updating the app code with the necessary data-testids and test entries.\n\nLet me verify I haven't missed any other writeApp.md directive violations by checking each one against the modal components—the searchable select requirement doesn't apply since this modal edits recipe properties directly rather than referencing other entities, the custom StatusSelect already avoids native HTML selects, there's no attachment functionality to validate, and padding is properly applied through CSS classes.\n\nNow I'm questioning whether the directive about abstracting all JSX into separate component files applies to nested sub-components like EditRecipeModal and StatusSelect, or only to page-level components—the directive language is broad, but these are internal to RecipeDetailHeader rather than directly rendered on the page itself.\n\nLet me focus specifically on what the Directives section lists rather than the Guidelines, since that's what the checkDirectives skill is meant to validate. Looking through the actual directives in writeApp.md, I see requirements around test IDs, netlify configuration, template syntax, null handling for dates, function paths, searchable selects, navigation links, select elements, and file-type icons for attachments.\n\nThe data-testid directive is the only clear violation I can identify. As for the inline styles in EquipmentRequiredList and EditRecipeModal—those use CSS variables like `var(--accent-primary)` and `var(--card-bg)`, so while it's a mix of approaches, it's not technically violating the directives since the preference for CSS files is listed in the Guidelines section, not the Directives.\n\nNow I'm checking the page padding directive more carefully. RecipeDetailsPage doesn't have padding on its root element, but the breadcrumb, title row, and page-content child all have 24px horizontal padding, so nothing is flush against the screen edges. The spirit of the directive seems satisfied even if the structure doesn't match the exact pattern described.\n\nThe only clear violation I've found is the missing data-testid attributes on the modal's Cancel and close buttons, which I've already flagged in a fix

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back.\n3. **For side effects, verify both primary effect and side effect, and assert exactly once** — no duplicate entries.\n4. **Avoid using `getByText()` with common words** that may appear as substrings. Prefer `getByTestId` or `getByRole` with exact matching.\n\n\n5. **All data-testid values must be consistent across test files.**\n6. **File upload tests must exercise actual file upload mechanics**, not substitute URL/text inputs.\n7. **NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside a `.toPass()` retry block** in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n8. **Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach** when Playwright provides fresh context.\n9. **Use generous timeouts** for backend round-trips.\n10. **For multi-step flows, use `test.slow()`** to triple timeout.\n11. Skill files are located at /repo/skills/tasks/.\n12. For deployment tests: use matching data-testid values, handle empty state, generous timeouts, verify API health.\n13. **Each described interaction must be tested** — don't write tests that only verify a subset.\n14. Auth flow tests for signup/signin and email verification.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test cases to ensure they follow these guidelines. RD-HDR-1 uses precise targeting with getByTestId and verifies the breadcrumb structure including the recipe name with ID, with a 30-second timeout. RD-HDR-2 asserts the navigation target correctly by checking the URL changes to /recipes with the same generous timeout. Checking RD-HDR-3...\n\nRD-HDR-3 through RD-HDR-4 both use getByTestId for targeting and verify exact text content, though RD-HDR-4 doesn't check CSS styling since that's outside Playwright's typical scope. RD-HDR-5 is more comprehensive — it uses test.slow(), opens the modal, verifies pre-filled fields, changes the name, saves, and then confirms the title and breadcrumb update, plus navigates away and back to verify persistence. Now moving through the description tests...\n\nRD-DESC-1 through RD-DESC-3 use getByTestId to verify card headings, description text, and empty states. The products section (RD-PROD-1 through RD-PROD-4) follows a similar pattern with column header verification and iterates through each product row using hasText filtering, plus checks the empty state. Materials tests mirror this structure, and the equipment section continues with the same approach...\n\nNow I'm verifying that the tests avoid getByText() entirely, relying instead on getByTestId and locator-based filtering. The equipment tests specifically check link navigation by clicking through to verify URLs, with one test using page.goBack() to return rather than reloading. I'm also checking the writeTests.md directives to ensure compliance. No unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach**: There's no beforeEach cleanup. There's a `beforeAll` that sets up data and an `afterAll` that cleans up. ✓\n\n**Directive: Generous timeouts**: All initial page loads use `timeout: 30000`. ✓\n\n**Directive: test.slow() for multi-step flows**: RD-HDR-5 and RD-EQUIP-4 use `test.slow()`. ✓\n\n**Directive: Consistent data-testid values**: I should check if other test files use the same testids for these components. Let me check.\n\n**Directive: Don't put locator calls with auto-wait inside .toPass()**: No `.toPass()` blocks used. ✓\n\n**Directive: Each described interaction must be tested**: Going through the test entries, I've got coverage for RD-HDR-1 through RD-HDR-5, RD-DESC-1 through RD-DESC-3, RD-PROD-1 through RD-PROD-4, RD-MAT-1 through RD-MAT-4, and RD-EQUIP-1 through RD-EQUIP-5. Though RD-HDR-4 mentions a blue \"Edit Recipe\" button appearing to the right of the page title, and I'm not sure the test actually validates that blue appearance specifically.\n\nLet me reconsider the writeTests.md directive about interactions. It says the test must exercise the exact field with corresponding actions and assertions. The directive is focused on interactions, not visual styling. The blue color and positioning are visual concerns, not interaction concerns. So skipping the CSS color check is acceptable here.\n\nNow I'm checking the navigation directive more carefully. In RD-EQUIP-4, the test uses `page.goBack()` which is fine. In RD-HDR-5, the test navigates away to `/recipes` and then back to the specific recipe to verify the change persists — that's explicitly testing persistence, not using navigation as a workaround for a missing component.\n\nFor the data-testid consistency, I'm verifying that all the test IDs match what's actually in the components, and they do across the board. I've verified all the test IDs are consistent throughout the file, and the test structure follows the writeTests.md guidelines well — using precise element targeting with `getByTestId`, proper navigation assertions, appropriate timeouts, and the `test.slow()` marker for multi-step tests. The main consideration is that tests share state through module-level variables, but since they're in the same spec file and worker, that's acceptable.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing a gap in the RD-HDR-5 test coverage. The spec requires verifying that the edit form is pre-filled with the recipe's name, description, products output, raw materials, and equipment, but the current test only checks name and description. According to the writeTests.md directive, when a spec describes editing multiple fields, the test needs to exercise and verify all of them, not just a subset.\n\nLooking at the actual EditRecipeModal implementation though, it only contains fields for name, description, product, version, and status—not the individual products output, raw materials, and equipment entries that the spec mentions. So there's a mismatch between what the spec says should be pre-filled and what the modal actually displays. The test is correctly verifying the fields that exist in the implementation, but the spec itself seems to describe a broader set of fields than what's actually implemented. The test spec mentions pre-filling name, description, products output, raw materials, and equipment, but the actual modal only has name, description, product, version, and status — so I should verify at least those fields that exist are being pre-filled, not just name and description. The directive requires testing all described interactions, and I need to clarify whether displaying pre-filled values counts as an interaction or just a display assertion.\n\nLooking at the spec more carefully, the core interaction is changing the recipe name and saving, which is properly tested. The pre-fill check is more of a setup assertion, so while it's incomplete, it's not a clear violation of the directive. Scanning through the rest of the test file, the tests appear well-structured with proper test IDs, timeouts, and navigation verification — I'm not finding obvious violations.\n\nNow I should check
