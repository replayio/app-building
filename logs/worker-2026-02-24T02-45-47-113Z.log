You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match.

The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email).

A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"af250214-c616-46cb-abd1-8eef9d4188b0","uuid":"9d1dd94b-2b4e-429f-a423-a22d12d92733","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

Let me analyze the mockup image and the existing test entries to understand what's already there and what needs to be updated.\n\nLooking at the mockup image:\n- Title: \"Upcoming Tasks\"\n- A blue \"New Task\" button in the top-right\n- A filter bar with a filter dropdown icon (filter icon with chevron) and a text input \"Filter...\"\n- Task cards showing:\n  1. High (red badge) | \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\" | \"Due: Today, 5:00 PM\" | Avatar + \"Sarah J. \n\n(PM)\" | \"...\" menu\n  2. Medium (yellow badge) | \"Review Client Proposal Draft\" | \"Due: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM\" | Avatar + \"David L. (Sales)\" | \"...\" menu\n  3. Low (green badge) | \"Update Team Documentation Documentation\" | \"Due: Oct 25, 2024\" | Avatar + \"Emily C. (Dev)\" | \"...\" menu\n  4. Normal (teal badge) | \"Prepare Weekly Status Report\" | \"Due: Oct 26, 2024\" | Avatar + \"Mark R. (Lead)\" | \"...\" menu\n\nNow I'm checking what test entries already exist in the documentation to see what's been covered.\n\nLooking at the existing tests, I can see TasksListPage has pretty thorough coverage across TasksFilterBar, TaskCard, CreateTaskModal, and TasksListContent. The filter bar tests cover search functionality and priority/status filtering both individually and combined, while the TaskCard tests verify the display of priority badges, titles, due dates, assignees, and navigation behavior through both card clicks and action menu options.\n\nFor CreateTaskModal, there are tests confirming form validation, successful task creation, dropdown population for assignees/clients/priorities, and modal closure through both the cancel button and overlay click. TasksListContent tests cover the page layout with heading and New Task button, loading and empty states, pagination controls, and navigation between pages.\n\nI'm also noticing the CSV functionality—both export and import are tested, including validation error handling for invalid import data. Looking at the remaining work, I need to verify the test coverage aligns with the planned components: TasksListPage structure, task card details like priority badges and assignee information with click navigation, filter controls with dropdown and text input, and the full CreateTaskModal specification. It seems the tests.md file already has substantial content, so I should check what's actually missing rather than duplicating what's already documented. for TasksListPage. Let me re-read more carefully. The existing content looks like it was already written. But the jobs say to \"decide on components\" and \"add test entries\". \n\nLet me check if this is existing content that already covers what's needed, or if I need to add/update it.\n\nLooking at the job descriptions again:\n1. PlanPageTasksListPage: Decide on components for TasksListPage, add sections to docs/tests.md\n2. PlanComponentTasksList: Add test entries for task cards (priority badge High/Medium/Low/Normal, title, due date, assignee avatar+name+role, action menu; click navigates to /tasks/:taskId)\n3. PlanComponentTasksFilterAndCreate: Add test entries for filter control (filter dropdown + text input), New Task button and CreateTaskModal\n\nIt seems like the existing content is already there. But comparing the mockup against the test entries, I can see the filter control with its icon and dropdown chevron, the four priority levels with their colors, and each task card with priority badge, title, due date, assignee details, and action menu. The existing tests already cover the TasksFilterBar with search and priority/status filters, TaskCard with all the visual elements and navigation, CreateTaskModal with the form, and TasksListContent with the heading and loading states.\n\nSo the existing tests.md already has everything needed. I should verify it's complete and accurate against the mockup and spec, then make any necessary updates or enhancements.\n\nLooking at the mockup, I can see the key elements: the \"Upcoming Tasks\" title, the \"New Task\" button, the filter bar with icon and search input, and the task cards showing priority badges, titles, due dates, assignees, and action menus. Checking against what's documented, all these components appear to be covered.\n\nNow I'm examining what the action menu should do—specifically the \"Edit\" option. The existing tests show the menu has \"View Details\", \"Edit\", \"Mark Complete\", \"Cancel Task\", and \"Delete\", but there's no test for what happens when you click \"Edit\". That would presumably open an EditTaskModal, though that's tested separately in the TaskDetailPage section rather than here.\n\nLooking at the job requirements more carefully, Job 2 asks for test entries covering priority badges, titles, due dates, assignees, and action menus that navigate to the task detail page—and the existing TaskCard section already handles all of that.\n\nJob 3 asks for filter controls, the New Task button, and CreateTaskModal with all its fields and validation—which the existing TasksFilterBar and CreateTaskModal sections already cover.\n\nSo the content appears complete, but there's a potential gap: the \"Edit\" action from the menu doesn't have its own test entry, which seems inconsistent with the strategy that every interactive element needs testing.\n\nLet me also cross-check the mockup against the existing tests to make sure nothing's been overlooked—the heading, New Task button, filter dropdown, and text input all appear to be accounted for. I notice the \"Edit\" action from the task menu doesn't have a dedicated test yet. Looking at the AppRevisions.md, editing should open an EditTaskModal or navigate to edit mode on the TaskDetailPage, so I need to add a test for that behavior in the TaskCard section. I should also verify the filter bar covers everything in the mockup—the search input and priority dropdown are already tested, so those are accounted for. Looking at the existing test structure, I notice the action menu tests mention \"Edit\" as an option but don't have a dedicated test for that interaction. I should add a specific test entry for when the Edit action is clicked from the task list, which should open the EditTaskModal. Let me review what's already there and fill in that gap. I'm reviewing the test specifications for the component plan jobs. The existing content covers most of the action menu behaviors in TaskCard, but I notice there's a gap—there's no test documented for the Edit action opening the EditTaskModal. That's something I need to add to make the coverage complete. For Job 3, the filter and modal tests are already comprehensive, so I just need to add the missing \"Edit opens EditTaskModal\" test entry to Job 2 and verify everything aligns with the strategy of

Let me add this missing test entry.\n\nNow I'm checking for other gaps: the mockup shows task cards in a list/card layout rather than a table, which matches the test descriptions. The filter bar includes a priority filter dropdown and text search input, but I'm noticing the mockup might also have a status filter that isn't fully covered in the tests.\n\nLooking at the priority colors, due date formatting, and assignee display, those all align with the mockup. The main gap is just that missing action menu Edit test for the TaskCard section. I don't see any CSV import/export buttons in the mockup either, so those aren't needed.\n\nLet me add that one missing test and then I'm done.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5227,"cache_read_input_tokens":40855,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5227,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"af250214-c616-46cb-abd1-8eef9d4188b0","uuid":"690aaef6-45fd-4dfe-adf0-9b8103e36818"}

The app continues to function in unauthenticated mode (all pages remain accessible).\n\n## ClientsListPage (/clients)\n\nComponents: ClientsTable, ClientsSearchAndFilters, ClientsPagination, AddClientModal, ClientsImportExport, ClientsListContent\n\n### ClientsTable\n\n#### Table displays correct column headers\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients.\n- **Expected:** The table displays seven column headers in order: Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, Open Deals, Next Task. The headers are visible and clearly labeled.\n\n#### Table rows display client name\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients (e.g., \"Acme Corp\", \"Globex Solutions\", \"Jane Doe\").\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the client's name in the Client Name column as the primary identifier (e.g., \"Acme Corp\"). The name is prominent and clearly readable.\n\n#### Table rows display client type\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients of different types.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the client type in the Type column as either \"Organization\" or \"Individual\" (e.g., \"Acme Corp\" shows \"Organization\", \"Jane Doe\" shows \"Individual\").\n\n#### Table rows display status badge with correct color\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients having different statuses.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the client's status as a colored badge in the Status column. \"Active\" has a green background, \"Inactive\" has a gray background, \"Prospect\" has a yellow/amber background, and \"Churned\" has a red/orange background. The badge text matches the client's current status.\n\n#### Table rows display tags as badges\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients that have tags assigned.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the client's tags as comma-separated badges in the Tags column (e.g., \"SaaS, Enterprise, Q3-Target\" for Acme Corp; \"Legacy, Partner\" for Globex Solutions). Clients with no tags show an empty cell or placeholder.\n\n#### Table rows display primary contact with name and title\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with organization clients that have associated contacts.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the primary contact's name followed by their title in parentheses in the Primary Contact column (e.g., \"Sarah Jenkins (CEO)\" for Acme Corp, \"Michael Chen (CTO)\" for Globex Solutions). For individual-type clients, the primary contact shows the client's own name with \"(Self)\" (e.g., \"Jane Doe (Self)\"). Clients with no primary contact show an empty cell or placeholder.\n\n#### Table rows display open deals count with total value\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients that have deals.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the number of open deals and their total value in the Open Deals column (e.g., \"3 (Value: $150k)\" for Acme Corp, \"1 (Value: $15k)\" for Jane Doe). Clients with no open deals show \"0\". The value is formatted with appropriate abbreviations (k for thousands, M for millions). Clients with deals but zero value show just the count (e.g., \"N/A\" for churned clients with no deals).\n\n#### Table rows display next task with description and date\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients that have upcoming tasks.\n- **Expected:** Each table row displays the next upcoming task description and its due date in the Next Task column (e.g., \"Follow-up call - Today, 2pm\" for Acme Corp, \"Send proposal - Tomorrow\" for Jane Doe, \"Review contract - Next Week\" for Stark Industries). Clients with no upcoming tasks show \"No task scheduled\". Dates for today and tomorrow show relative labels with time.\n\n#### Clicking a client row navigates to ClientDetailPage\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients.\n- **Action:** User clicks on a client row (e.g., the row for \"Acme Corp\" with client id 1).\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /clients/1 and the ClientDetailPage is displayed showing the full details for that client.\n\n#### Clicking an individual client row navigates to ClientDetailPage\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with individual-type clients.\n- **Action:** User clicks on an individual client row (e.g., the row for \"Jane Doe\" with client id 3).\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /clients/3 and the ClientDetailPage is displayed showing the full details for that individual client.\n\n#### Action menu icon displayed on each row\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients.\n- **Expected:** Each table row has a three-dot menu icon (\"...\") on the far right side. The icon is visible and clickable.\n\n#### Action menu shows options on click\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with clients.\n- **Action:** User clicks the three-dot menu icon (\"...\") on a client row.\n- **Expected:** A dropdown menu appears with options including: \"View Details\", \"Edit\", and \"Delete\".

The current client data is pre-populated in the form fields.\n\n#### Action menu Delete removes the client with confirmation\n- **Initial state:** The three-dot action menu is open on a client row.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Delete\" from the action menu.\n- **Expected:** A confirmation dialog appears asking the user to confirm deletion (e.g., \"Are you sure you want to delete this client?\"). Upon confirmation, the client is deleted via the API and the row is removed from the table. The total client count decreases by one.\n\n#### Action menu Delete cancellation keeps the client\n- **Initial state:** The delete confirmation dialog is open for a client.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"Cancel\" on the confirmation dialog.\n- **Expected:** The dialog closes. The client remains in the table unchanged.\n\n### ClientsSearchAndFilters\n\n#### Search input filters clients by name\n- **Initial state:** ClientsListPage is loaded with multiple clients visible (e.g., \"Acme Corp\", \"Globex Solutions\", \"Stark Industries\").\n- **Action:** User types \"Acme\" into the search input (placeholder text \"Search clients by name, tag, or contact...\").\n- **Expected:** The clients table updates to show only clients whose name contains \"Acme\" (e.g., \"Acme Corp\"). Non-matching clients are hidden.
