I need to analyze what shell commands were used in each. Let me look at the outputs I already have.\n\nFor log 21: The output shows it was running an AnalyzeGroup task for test failures. The shell commands visible are:\n- `mkdir -p /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-analysis`\n- `ls -1 /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-analysis/`\n\nBut the output was truncated. The read-log command outputs include `$` prefixed lines showing commands. \n\nI'm realizing the logs I've already read contain the information I need, but the Bash tool truncated them due to character limits. I should re-read the logs with truncated output to capture the full shell commands, especially since the instructions warn against piping read-log through filters.\n\nLooking at the shell commands from the `$` prefixed lines, I can see Log 21 and Log 22 both ran AnalyzeGroup operations for test failures, creating report directories and using npm to read multiple worker logs for analysis purposes.\n\nContinuing through Log 23 and Log 24, I'm seeing the same pattern repeat—more AnalyzeGroup test failure analyses with directory creation and log reading commands, though Log 24 appears to be a simpler variant that just lists the report directory contents.\n\nNow looking at Log 25, I'm realizing I need to reconsider what I'm actually examining here. These logs from the current review worker are showing me the shell commands that were executed during each iteration, and those commands themselves reference previous worker logs. The actual work being done—the AnalyzeGroup operations for test failures—is what I need to track across these iterations.\n\nLooking at Log 21, the worker created an analysis directory and listed its contents, delegating most of the work to 10 Agent subagents rather than running direct shell commands. Log 22 shows a similar pattern with directory creation and multiple read-log commands, though the output got cut off before I could see the full command list.\n\nLogs 23 through 25 follow the same structure—creating timestamped or generic analysis directories, then running batches of read-log commands to process test failure data, with Log 25 appearing to be truncated mid-command. I'm realizing the read-log outputs are showing the actual content of previous worker sessions, which is making this harder to parse. The lines prefixed with `$` represent bash commands that were executed, while the bracketed prefixes like `[read]`, `[write]`, `[glob]`, and `[grep]` indicate tool calls made by those agents. I need to extract all the `$` prefixed lines from each log to get an accurate count of the actual shell commands that were run.\n\nI've processed logs 23-25 so far, but some outputs got truncated. Let me now read the remaining logs I haven't examined yet—logs 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30.\n\nActually, I realize I need to be more systematic here. I've already started on the first batch with the mkdir command and logs 21-25, so let me focus on extracting the shell commands from those logs I've already reviewed. Looking at what the agent actually executed in each one, I can see the Bash commands marked with `$` prefixes. Let me compile those command lists for logs 21-25 first before moving on to the remaining logs. The agent is now creating another analysis directory with a timestamp and running multiple `npm run read-log` commands to process logs from different worker instances, pulling data from several numbered log files in sequence. I'm realizing I need to distinguish between the commands the agent actually ran in log 22 versus the commands that appear in the output of those read-log calls—the latter are from previous worker sessions and shouldn't be counted. Looking more carefully at the structure, I can see the agent read some files, created a directory, and started analyzing logs, but I need to parse out only the top-level commands it executed rather than the nested commands shown in the output. I see the nested structure now—when the agent runs `npm read-log` on one of the worker logs, that output contains bash commands from within that log file itself, which creates layers of `$` prefixes that I need to carefully parse to understand what actually executed versus what was just logged content. I'm seeing a pattern here—there are multiple `npm run read-log` commands being executed sequentially, each reading from different worker app logs and piping the output through `head -500` to limit the results. These appear to be part of a systematic analysis of various build logs numbered from 116 onwards. Looking at the bash output more carefully, I can see the agent used `head -500` to truncate the log reads, but in this latest run the commands don't have that limit—they're reading the full logs with just `2>&1` redirection. The agent created the reports directory and then started reading through a series of worker app build logs sequentially. I see that log 24 actually used subagents to run those read-log commands, not executing them at the top level—the \"[Agent]\" markers in the output make that clear. Looking more closely at the actual command sequence, it created the reports directory, listed its contents, then had subagents execute multiple read-log commands across different worker logs. I'm looking more carefully at how the read-log output distinguishes between direct Bash commands and agent-executed commands. When `[Agent]` appears, it indicates subagents were used, but the `npm run read-log` commands that follow still show up in the top-level log output—they're just the commands that ran within those agent contexts. For the shell commands report, I need to figure out whether to count these agent-internal commands or only the direct Bash calls made at the top level.\n\nI think the practical approach is to count all shell commands that appear anywhere in the logs, since they all executed during this worker session.

Let me analyze each one for shell commands and write the analysis files. The analysis directory is `reports/report-shellCommands-reference-apps-1-review-20260228-202738-analysis/`.\n\nLet me go through each log and extract the shell commands:\n\n**Log 21** (worker-app-building-0f55gu-21): AnalyzeGroup for test failures\n- `mkdir -p /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-analysis` - create directory\n- `ls -1 /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-analysis/` - list files\n\n\n- Used 10 Agent subagents internally, 2 distinct top-level shell commands, completed successfully\n\n**Log 22** (worker-app-building-0f55gu-22): AnalyzeGroup for test failures\n- `mkdir -p /repo/reports/report-testFailures-reference-apps-1-review-20260228-202738-analysis` - create analysis directory\n- `npm run read-log` commands to process worker logs, with head filtering to limit output to 500 lines\n\n, then checking the tail of one log with 200 lines, and listing the test failure report directory—about 13 commands total that all succeeded without issues.\n\nNow I'm moving to the next analysis group, creating the reports directory and reading through a series of worker app logs to analyze test failures, pulling logs 107 through 110 and beyond. Reading through the test failure logs across multiple worker instances to analyze what went wrong. I'm seeing that 10 agents were deployed to analyze the test failures, polling for task completion as they finished, then globbing the results directory to collect the generated reports. Continuing to review the shell commands executed across these logs—the next batch shows similar patterns with directory creation and file listing operations to analyze test failures, using a smaller set of subagents in Log 28 before moving into Log 29. The second attempt had some initial failures with the npm commands, but after running npm install, the retries succeeded. Now I'm moving on to write out all 10 analysis files.","signature":"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
