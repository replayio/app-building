No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested.

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`.

Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

[2026-02-26T20:54:13.517Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_017wYn2qz19RN8Ge3bKRE87h","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have all the context. Let me systematically go through the MaterialsPage test entries and check against each testSpec.md directive.\n\nLet me look at the mockup description for MaterialsPage more carefully:\n\nFrom AppSpec.md (page 4):\n- MaterialsPage (/materials)\n- Description: Global list of materials tracked in the system, across all accounts. Layout: buttons at the top to create a new material or new material category, then filter/sort bar to filter by category or account; a main table with columns: Material Name, Category, Unit of Measure, Stock, and Actions (View Detail, Edit). Functionality: search materials by name, filter by category, define and edit categories, and navigate to a material's detailed view.\n\n\n- The mockup is from utfs.io so I can't view it directly, but let me check if it was downloaded.\n\nNow I'm going through each directive from testSpec.md. The test entries systematically cover all the visible elements: the new material and category buttons at the top, the search and filter controls, the main materials table with its columns and row actions, sorting and pagination functionality.\n\nComparing against the AppSpec requirements, the component coverage looks complete—the buttons for creating materials and categories are tested, the filtering by category and account is covered, the table with all specified columns and actions is accounted for, and the search functionality is included.\n\nBut I'm noticing a gap: the spec explicitly mentions \"define and edit categories,\" yet I only see a test for creating new categories, not for editing existing ones. That's a potential violation of the directive to match the app spec as closely as possible and systematically inventory every visible element. Let me focus on what the directives actually require me to check rather than getting sidetracked by implementation concerns.\n\nFor Directive 2, the test entries cover all the columns mentioned in the spec—Material Name, Category, Unit of Measure, Stock, and Actions—so that seems aligned. On Directive 3, I'm verifying that each clickable element has a specific navigation target or action result: the New Material and New Category buttons specify they open modals, the View Detail and eye icon both navigate to the material detail page, and the Edit link opens an edit modal.\n\nThe material name itself also navigates to the detail page, the breadcrumb Home goes to the Dashboard, and the pagination controls, filters, sort dropdown, and search bar all specify their respective behaviors. Everything checks out there.\n\nFor Directive 4, I need to verify that data mutations like creating a material are tested for persistence and side effects—the test entry confirms the new material gets saved to the database.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the app has timeline or history features that might be triggered by these actions. Looking at the spec, there are transaction and batch lineage tracking features, but creating or editing materials shouldn't generate history entries, so the current test coverage seems sufficient.\n\nFor Directive 5, I'm verifying the button styling—the \"+ New Material\" button should have a plus icon, the text label, and be styled as a primary action button in blue.  The \"+ New Category\" button follows the same pattern but with secondary/outlined styling. The search bar has the magnifying glass icon, the sort dropdown shows the default \"Sort by: Name (A-Z)\" text, and pagination controls display proper highlighting and disabled states.\n\nFor Directive 6, I'm confirming that all modal dialogs are properly tested across their full lifecycle: opening, submitting with valid data, validating required fields, and canceling. The New Material modal tests name, category, and unit validation; the New Category modal tests the name field; and the Edit Material modal tests opening via both the Edit link and pencil icon, along with submit and cancel behavior.\n\nDirectives 7 and 8 don't apply here since there are no import/upload dialogs or backend integrations in the MaterialsPage.\n\nFor Directive 9, I'm checking that state changes propagate correctly: creating a material adds it to the table, creating a category updates both the filter dropdown and the category selection dropdown, and editing a material updates its row. I'm wondering whether creating a new material properly updates the pagination count, though this is likely covered implicitly when the new row appears in the table.\n\nThe category creation test confirms that newly created categories immediately appear in the CategoryFilter and the material creation form without requiring a page reload, and there's a separate test verifying this cross-component state update works.\n\nDirectives 10 and 11 aren't applicable—consistent navigation/styling is a broader concern beyond individual page tests, and there's no attachment functionality in the MaterialsPage.\n\nI'm noticing a potential gap though: the spec mentions \"define and edit categories,\" but the test entries only cover creation, not editing existing categories. Without seeing the actual mockup, I can't be certain whether an edit category feature should exist, but if it does, that would violate the directive to systematically inventory every visible element and not substitute easier-to-implement features for what's shown. The spec explicitly calls for \"edit categories\" functionality, so this isn't about adding extra features—it's a requirement that needs testing. Looking at the MaterialsPage test entries, there's nothing covering category editing, only creation through the NewCategoryButton. I should check whether the mockup actually shows an edit button on this page, or if that functionality lives elsewhere in the app like a settings section. I'm noticing the redundancy here—there are four separate clickable elements doing essentially the same two things: View Detail and Edit. Both a text link and an icon navigate to the detail page, and both a text link and an icon trigger the edit modal. Without the mockup, I can't say whether this is intentional design or imprecision in the test spec, so I'll focus on what I can definitively verify against the directives.\n\nLooking at the breadcrumb specifically, \"Materials\" is the current page so it shouldn't be clickable—that's probably fine. For the create material test, it mentions persistence but doesn't specify side effects like dashboard updates, though that might not apply here since there's no history feature. But I should check whether state-changing actions are being tested for their ripple effects across the app.\n\nThe spec mentions timeline and batch lineage features, but creating or editing materials doesn't seem to trigger timeline entries or affect reciprocal relationships, so those directives don't really apply. I'm also noticing the spec only lists \"View Detail\" and \"Edit\" actions for materials—no delete action shown. The guidelines suggest adding delete buttons if needed for a complete app, but since the spec and mockup don't show it, I'm uncertain whether to include it.\n\nLet me refocus on the actual Directives section rather than the tips. The first directive is about consistent styling and navigation across pages, which I can't fully verify without seeing the mockup. The second directive is about systematically inventorying every visible element in the mockup—every column header, filter, button, icon, and badge—to write test entries for each one, since it's easy to overlook minor elements. I've checked the remaining directives and the MaterialsPage tests look solid overall—no obvious violations. Let me see if I can pull up the mockup to verify everything matches what's actually specified

[2026-02-26T20:55:31.458Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_016yrsbxCNPytMB5KSgVwWpm","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup. Let me analyze it carefully:\n\n**Elements visible in the mockup:**\n\n1. **Header**: \"Materials\" title\n2. **Breadcrumb**: \"Home > Materials\" (Home is a link)\n3. **Navigation sidebar**: Dashboard, Materials (highlighted), Inventory, Orders, Reports, Settings\n4. **\"+ New Material\" button** - blue/filled primary button with plus icon\n5. **\"+ New Category\" button** - outlined secondary button with plus icon\n6. **Search bar**: \"Search materials by name...\" with magnifying glass icon\n7. **\"Filter by Category\" dropdown** - showing Raw Materials, Components, Packaging\n\n\n8. **\"Filter by Account\" dropdown** - showing All Accounts, Account A, Account B\n9. **\"Sort by: Name (A-Z)\" dropdown**\n10. **Table with columns**: Material Name, Category, Unit of Measure, Stock, Actions\n11. **Actions column per row**: [View Detail] text link, [Edit] text link, eye icon, pencil/edit icon\n12. **Pagination**: Previous, 1, 2, 3, Next, \"Showing 1-8 of 45 items\"\n13. **Data rows**: Steel Sheet 10Ga, Aluminum Extrusion X-Profile, Cardboard Box (Small), Polycarbonate Pellets, M6 Bolt & Nut Set, Shrink Wrap Roll (Clear), Circuit Board v2.1, Copper Wire 16AWG\n\nI'm noticing a discrepancy between the mockup navigation and the AppSpec—the mockup shows Dashboard, Materials, Inventory, Orders, Reports, and Settings, but the spec lists Dashboard, Accounts, Materials, Batches, Transactions, and Settings. Since the directive prioritizes consistent navigation and styling, I should align the test entries with the AppSpec structure rather than the mockup.\n\nThe filter bar and table layout match well between the mockup and test entries. Looking at what's covered: the Actions column has all four elements (View Detail text, Edit text, eye icon, and pencil icon), and the Unit of Measure column header is properly represented in the test entries even though it appears truncated in the mockup image.\n\nThe user avatar in the top right is likely part of a shared navigation component tested elsewhere. Scanning through systematically, the page title \"Materials\" isn't explicitly tested as its own test case, though the breadcrumb test mentions it exists below the page heading. Most test entries focus on interactive and state-based elements rather than static headings, so this seems reasonable. is there a test that verifies the page heading \"Materials\" is displayed? I don't see one specifically for that. The breadcrumb test says \"below the page heading\" which implies the page heading exists, but it doesn't assert it. This could be a minor omission.\n\nBut is this really a directive violation? The directive says \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\" A page heading is a visible element. But it's not interactive, and test entries typically focus on interactive elements and their behavior. I think this is borderline.\n\nLet me now check the actual component code and test files to do the other subtasks.\n\nActually, wait — for the first subtask I'm only checking testSpec.md directive violations in the test entries. Let me finalize my analysis.\n\nNow I'm comparing the mockup against the test entries more carefully. The mockup shows \"Delete\" isn't listed as an action for materials, only \"View Detail\" and \"Edit\" with their icons, which matches the test entries. The \"Unit of Measure\" column appears truncated in the mockup but the test uses the full name, which is fine. Pagination shows the expected format, filter dropdowns display their options correctly, and everything lines up with what's tested. is just the mockup framing.\n\nI think the test entries for MaterialsPage are actually quite thorough and don't have clear directive violations. The coverage looks good.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. Let me look at a few specific directives more carefully:\n\n**\"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\"**\n\nThe clickable elements are well-covered: the new material and category buttons open modals, the search and filter dropdowns modify the table display, the view and edit links navigate to detail pages or open modals, the breadcrumb goes home, and pagination controls move between pages. The materials navigation link doesn't need explicit testing since it's already the current page.\n\n**\"For every form input, the test entry must specify the exact validation rules, error messages, and success behavior.\"**\n\nThe search input and filter dropdowns are covered. The sort dropdown is covered. These are all straightforward.\n\n**\"For every table or list, the test entry must specify: the exact columns/fields displayed, the exact sorting behavior, the exact filtering behavior, the exact pagination behavior.\"**\n\nThe table columns are specified, sorting is covered, filtering is covered, pagination is covered.\n\nI think the MaterialsPage test entries are solid and complete. Looking at the modal test coverage, I've got the New Material and New Category modals tested for opening, submission, validation, and cancellation. The Edit Material modal is similarly covered with tests for opening via different methods, submission, cancellation, and validation of all three required fields—Material Name, Category, and Unit of Measure. This feels comprehensive.\n\nNow I'm checking against the persistence requirement: creating a material gets persisted to the database and appears in the MaterialsTable, which covers the main side effects. Since the inventory tracker uses Transactions for history rather than tracking material creation itself, no history entry is needed there. For categories, I need to verify the same persistence and side effect patterns are being tested.\n\nLooking at material editing, the changeable fields are name, category, unit of measure, and description—none of which would trigger transaction history since those are metadata changes, not quantity movements. The test correctly verifies the database persistence and MaterialsTable updates without expecting history entries. No violations found in the MaterialsPage test entries against the testSpec.md

Let me compile the directives:\n\n**writeApp.md Directives:**\n\n1. Always run `npm run check` from the app directory, not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root.\n2. When working on a component, identify test entries in the spec relevant to that component and make sure entry requirements are satisfied.\n3. Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup.\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything E2E tests need to target.\n\n\n5. In a monorepo, add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` to `netlify.toml` etc.\n6. When using the neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax.\n7. For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, convert empty strings to null using `value || null`.\n8. Netlify Functions at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at path index 2 and resource ID at index 3.\n9. When building modals that reference other entities, use a searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n10. Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links to the same URL.\n11. Never use native HTML `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system.\n12. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons.\n13. Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.\n14. Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`).\n\nNow I'm checking each component to verify compliance with these guidelines. Looking at MaterialsPage.tsx, the page content div and loading state both have the required padding applied correctly.\n\nChecking the test IDs and component usage across the page—the filters are using the custom FilterSelect component rather than native selects, and the modals follow the same pattern. Moving on to MaterialsTable.tsx to verify its test IDs and structure...\n\nNow I'm examining the edit modal validation logic more carefully. The `handleSaveEdit` function only checks that the material name is filled in, but the test cases expect validation for Category and Unit of Measure as well—this is a mismatch between what the tests require and what the code actually validates.\n\nI'm also noticing that the edit modal uses a single `editError` string instead of a `Record<string, string>` like the create modal does, which limits its ability to show multiple field-specific errors.\n\nLooking at the filters on the MaterialsPage, I see it's using `FilterSelect` components for both the category and account filters rather than the dedicated `CategoryFilter` and `AccountFilter` components that exist in the codebase.\n\nNow I need to check what `FilterSelect` actually renders to understand if it's meeting the test requirements for these filter

Let me check each writeApp.md directive systematically:\n\n**Directive 1: Always run `npm run check` from the app directory**\n- This is a process directive, not something I can check in the code itself. Skip.\n\n**Directive 2: When working on a component, identify test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.**\n\nLet me check each component against its test entries:\n\n**MaterialsTable.tsx:**\n- Test: \"Edit material modal validates that Category is required\" (line 899)\n  - The save handler only validates the material name, not the category or unit fields. **VIOLATION!** Both the category and unit of measure tests fail because these fields aren't being validated in the edit modal.\n\n**MaterialsPage.tsx (filter bar):**\n- The filter bar is using `FilterSelect` from shared components for category and account filtering, rather than the dedicated `CategoryFilter.tsx` and `AccountFilter.tsx` components that exist in the codebase.\n\nNow I'm checking the testId patterns between these implementations. `FilterSelect` generates testIds like `${testId}-trigger`, `${testId}-dropdown`, and `${testId}-option-${option.value}`, while the standalone `CategoryFilter` uses `category-filter-trigger`, `category-filter-menu`, and `category-filter-option-${cat.id}`. The dropdown menu testId is where they diverge — `FilterSelect` uses `${testId}-dropdown` but `CategoryFilter` uses `category-filter-menu`.\n\nSince `MaterialsPage` actually uses `FilterSelect`, the tests need to match those testId patterns, not the ones from the unused standalone component. This is a mismatch between what the tests expect and what the page actually renders.\n\nNow I'm checking the visual elements against the mockup—the buttons, search bar, and dropdowns all match their intended styles and icons, and I'm verifying the table structure aligns with the design.\n\nMoving through the test ID requirements, I'm confirming that MaterialsPage, MaterialsTable, and the Material components all have the necessary data-testid attributes on interactive elements, containers, and list items. I've verified the CreateCategoryModal has proper test IDs across all its fields. Now I'm checking the remaining directives—the monorepo netlify.toml configuration isn't something I need to validate per-page, so I'll skip that. For the Neon serverless driver, I'm confirming that materials.ts uses only tagged template literals for all SQL queries with no function-call syntax anywhere.\n\nMoving through the database column handling, I'm seeing that UUID and empty string conversions are properly implemented with the `value || null` pattern where needed, and since date/timestamp columns aren't being written in these operations, that's covered. For the Netlify Functions path parsing, I'm tracing through how the URL segments are split and filtered to extract the materialId correctly.\n\nNow checking the modal directives—both CreateMaterialModal and EditMaterialModal are using FilterSelect for category selection, which is good, but they're not passing the `searchable={true}` prop even though the component supports it. The directive technically calls for a searchable dropdown, so while this works fine for a small category list, it's not fully aligned with the requirement.\n\nMoving on to native HTML elements—I've confirmed that MaterialsPage, the materials table, and both modals are all using the custom FilterSelect component instead of native `<select>` elements, which is correct. Directive 12 about attachment icons doesn't apply here.\n\nFor the padding requirement, both the main page content and loading state have the proper `p-6 max-sm:p-3` classes applied. The key issue I'm identifying is that the edit modal's save handler only validates the material name, but it should also be validating the Category and Unit of Measure fields based on the test data structure. Looking at the component structure, the MaterialsTable, MaterialsSearchBar, MaterialsSortDropdown, and MaterialsPagination all appear layout-agnostic with no problematic outer padding. The CategoryFilter component has a className on its root that might add layout styles, but since it's not used in MaterialsPage, that's not a concern here.\n\nThe AccountFilter component uses a different label than what MaterialsPage expects, but again that's irrelevant since MaterialsPage uses FilterSelect instead. The main issue I've identified is the missing validation in the edit material modal, so I should document that as a
