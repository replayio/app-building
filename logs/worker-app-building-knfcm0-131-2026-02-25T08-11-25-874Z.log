You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bb6b45fb-9092-4701-beec-34c8f4a4c5ba","uuid":"7af69bdd-cf19-4837-be92-9eec1f8814da","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated.

The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page.

Sales CRM — Test Specification\n\n## Sidebar (persistent across all pages)\n\n### Components: SidebarNavigation, SidebarAuth\n\n#### SidebarNavigation\n\n**Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons**\nGiven the app loads on any page, the sidebar displays exactly six navigation links — Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings — each with a corresponding icon. No Dashboard, Reports, or other placeholder links are shown.\n\n**Clients link navigates to /clients**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Clients\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /clients and the ClientsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Contacts link navigates to /contacts**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Contacts\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /contacts and the ContactsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Deals link navigates to /deals**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Deals\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /deals and the DealsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Tasks link navigates to /tasks**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Tasks\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /tasks and the TasksListPage is displayed.\n\n**Team link navigates to /users**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Team\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /users and the UsersListPage is displayed.\n\n**Settings link navigates to /settings**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Settings\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /settings and the SettingsPage is displayed.\n\n**Active link is visually highlighted for current page**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the \"Clients\" sidebar link has a visually distinct active state (e.g., highlighted background or bold text), and all other links appear in their default inactive style. The same highlighting applies to whichever page is current — navigating to /deals highlights \"Deals\", navigating to /tasks highlights \"Tasks\", etc.\n\n**Active state updates on navigation**\nGiven the user is on /clients with the \"Clients\" link highlighted, when they click the \"Deals\" link, the highlight moves from \"Clients\" to \"Deals\" and the app navigates to /deals.\n\n**Sidebar persists across page navigation**\nWhen the user navigates between pages (e.g., from /clients to /deals to /tasks), the sidebar remains visible and does not re-mount or lose state.\n\n#### SidebarAuth\n\n**Sign In button displays when not authenticated**\nGiven the user is not logged in, the sidebar user area (upper left, below the app title) shows a \"Sign In\" button. No avatar, name, or sign-out control is visible.\n\n**Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form**\nGiven the user is not authenticated, when they click the \"Sign In\" button, an inline form appears within the sidebar containing: an email input field, a password input field, a \"Sign In\" submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch to \"Sign Up\" mode.\n\n**Sign In form submission with valid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters a valid email and password and clicks the \"Sign In\" submit button, the user is authenticated, the inline form disappears, and the sidebar user area shows the user's avatar (or initials), name, and a sign-out button.\n\n**Sign In form shows error for invalid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters an invalid email/password combination and clicks \"Sign In\", an error message is displayed within the form and the form remains visible for correction.\n\n**Sign In / Sign Up toggle switches form mode**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user clicks the \"Sign Up\" toggle, the form switches to Sign Up mode — the submit button text changes to \"Sign Up\" and the toggle text changes to allow switching back to \"Sign In\". Clicking the toggle again returns to Sign In mode.\n\n**Sign Up form submission creates account (test mode)**\nGiven the inline auth form is in Sign Up mode, when the user fills in an email and password and clicks \"Sign Up\", in test mode (IS_TEST=true) the account is auto-confirmed, the user is immediately logged in, and the sidebar shows avatar/name/sign-out. In production mode, a message indicates a confirmation email has been sent.\n\n**Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible, when the user clicks the \"Forgot password?\" link, the app navigates to /auth/forgot-password.\n\n**Avatar and name display when authenticated**\nGiven the user is logged in, the sidebar user area (upper left, below app title) displays the user's avatar (or initials fallback), their display name, and a sign-out control.

Let me analyze what I see:\n\n**Header area:**\n- Client name \"Acme Corp\" in large text\n- \"Organization\" badge (type badge)\n- \"Active\" badge (status badge - green)\n- Tags: \"Enterprise\", \"Software\", \"High Priority\"\n- \"Referral\" tag with a pencil/edit icon next to it\n- No explicit FollowButton visible, but the spec mentions it\n\n**Quick Actions (top right):**\n- Add Task (list icon + \"Add Task\" label)\n- Add Deal (clock icon + \"Add Deal\" label)\n\n\n- Add Attachment (paperclip icon + \"Add Attachment\" label)\n- Add Person (person icon + \"Add Person\" label)\n\n**Source Info section:**\n- \"Source Info\" header with \"Edit\" button (pencil icon + \"Edit\" text) in the top right\n- Acquisition Source: Referral (John Smith)\n- Campaign: None\n- Channel: Direct Sales\n- Date Acquired: 2023-01-15\n\n**Tasks section (left column):**\n- \"Tasks\" header with \"Unresolved tasks\" subtext\n- Checkboxes for each task\n- \"Follow up on proposal\" - Due: Today, Deal: 'Acme Software License'\n- \"Schedule onboarding call\" - Due: Tomorrow\n- \"Prepare Q3 Review\" - Due: Next Week\n\n**Deals section (left column, below Tasks):**\n- \"Deals\" header\n- \"Acme Software License\" - Stage: Proposal Sent, Value: $50,000\n- \"Additional Services\" - Stage: Qualification, Value: $10,000\n\n**Attachments section (left column, below Deals):**\n- \"Attachments\" header\n- \"Service Agreement.pdf\" - Document - Created: 2023-02-01 - Linked Deal: 'Acme Software License' - download icon - delete icon (trash)\n- \"Project Scope.docx\" - Document - Created: 2023-02-10 - Linked Deal: None - download icon - delete icon\n- \"Client Website Link\" - Link - Created: 2023-01-15 - Linked Deal: None - view icon (eye) - delete icon\n\n**People section (right column):**\n- \"People\" header\n- Sarah Johnson - CEO (with avatar)\n- Michael Chen - CTO (with avatar)\n- Emily Davis - Project Manager (with avatar)\n\n**Timeline section (right column, below People):**\n- \"Timeline\" header\n- Today: \"Task Created: 'Follow up on proposal' by User A\"\n- Yesterday: \"Note Added: 'Client mentioned interest in new features.' by User B\"\n- 2 days ago: \"Deal Stage Changed: 'Acme Software License' from 'Qualification' to 'Proposal Sent' by User A\"\n- Last Week: \"Email Sent: 'Meeting Confirmation' to Sarah Johnson\"\n- Last Month: \"Contact Created\"\n\nNow I have a clear picture of the mockup layout. The tests.md file already lists all the components I need to build, so I'll start scaffolding out the sections and then work through each component's test entries systematically. Now I'm mapping out the specific test cases for each component—checking what ClientHeader should display like the client name, type and status badges, tags, and the edit icon, then verifying QuickActions has all four action buttons, SourceInfoSection captures the acquisition details with an edit option, and the various sections like Tasks, Deals, and Attachments render their content correctly with proper interactions like navigation and checkboxes. Looking at the subtask breakdown, I need to build out the ClientDetailPage with a header component showing the client name and status badges, quick action buttons for creating tasks and deals, a source info section with acquisition details, and then the main content sections for tasks, deals, attachments, and people.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the test cases for the ClientHeader component—verifying that the name displays correctly, the type and status badges render with proper color coding, tags show up as badges, and the edit pencil icon opens an edit modal where I can update the client information.\n\nFor QuickActions, I need to ensure each button (Add Task, Add Deal, Add Attachment, Add Person) is visible and clickable, and that each one triggers its corresponding modal.\n\nThen there's SourceInfoSection where I'm checking that the acquisition source, campaign, and channel fields all display properly.\n\nMoving into TasksSection, I'm verifying that unresolved tasks render with checkboxes, titles, and due dates, and that completing a task removes it from the list and creates a timeline entry. I also need to test that clicking a task navigates to its detail page.\n\nFor DealsSection, I'm checking that deal cards display the name, stage, and value, with multiple deals showing as separate cards.\n\nNow looking at AttachmentsSection, I need to verify the section displays with proper file icons, filenames, types, and dates for each attachment, along with linked deal information. Documents should have download buttons, links should have view buttons, and all attachments need delete functionality with confirmation. Image thumbnails should preview, and I need to test both file upload and URL-based attachment modes.\n\nFor PeopleSection, I'm checking that each person displays with an avatar, name, and role, with clicking functionality to navigate to their profile.\n\nMoving into TimelineSection, the events need to display in reverse chronological order with specific formatting for different event types—task creation, notes, deal stage changes, emails, and contact additions should all show relevant details and user links that navigate properly. Relative time labels like \"Today\" or \"2 days ago\" should appear instead of absolute dates.\n\nFor AddTaskModal, I'm verifying the modal opens from the quick action, has the required title field, optional due date and deal selector, priority field, and assignment capability.\n\nAddDealModal follows a similar pattern with deal name, stage, value, and owner fields, creating the deal and generating a timeline entry when submitted.\n\nAddAttachmentModal needs to toggle between file upload and URL input modes.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the AddPersonModal tests—it should have name, role, and contact info fields, then create the person and add a timeline entry.\n\nI should also check if the component list in the tests file needs updating since we've defined all these modals.\n\nLooking at the mockup again, the FollowButton sits in the header area but has its own auth-gated behavior, so it makes sense to list it separately in the components.\n\nNow I need to write out the full tests.md content with all these test cases... I need to follow the skill structure more carefully here. The PlanPageClientDetailPage task is about deciding on components and adding section headers to the docs, while each PlanComponent task handles the actual test entries for that specific component. Let me organize this efficiently by setting up all the sections at once, then filling in the test entries for each component. Now I'm looking at the remaining test entries I need to add for PeopleSection, TimelineSection, and the modal components.
