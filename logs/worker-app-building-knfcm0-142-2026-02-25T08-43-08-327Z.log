Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly.

Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0f198ce2-da73-445b-b69d-c5e50d053143","uuid":"474c3d42-1378-4003-ac6d-f0bbfd72f9c4","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification.

Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth).

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0f198ce2-da73-445b-b69d-c5e50d053143","uuid":"cbebfb3d-96c2-4ede-8725-549ef273dafa","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-size: 14px;\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex / Value         |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —                   |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.05)` | ~5% warm black     |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(234, 231, 226)`     | `#eae7e2`          |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(242, 240, 236)`     | `#f2f0ec`          |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(230, 237, 232)`     | `#e6ede8`          |\n\nSelected row uses a very faint green tint to reinforce the accent color without being loud.\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: 4px;\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px 8px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(55, 52, 46);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background           | Description                  |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| Default | transparent          | No background                |\n| Hover   | rgb(235, 233, 228)   | `#ebe9e4` — warm subtle gray |\n| Active  | rgb(226, 224, 218)   | `#e2e0da` — slightly deeper  |\n\n### Active Nav Item (current page)\n\n```css\nbackground: rgb(226, 234, 229);  /* very faint green tint */\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#ddd9d3` — a warm gray rather than cool.\nHover border darkens to approximately `#c5c0b8`.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value | Usage                     |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| 4px   | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px   | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px   | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%   | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                    |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.15) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows use a warm-tinted black rather than pure black, keeping the overall palette cohesive.\n\n---\n\n## Transitions\n\n| Property         | Duration | Easing   | Usage                    |\n|------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|\n| background-color | 0.1s     | ease     | Fast hover interactions  |\n| opacity          | 0.2s     | ease-out | Standard fade-in/out     |\n| color            | 0.15s    | ease     | Text color shifts        |\n| fill             | 0.4s     | ease     | Icon color transitions   |\n\n---\n\n## CSS Custom Properties\n\n### Backgrounds & Colors\n`--bg-color`, `--bg-sidebar-color`, `--bg-base-color`, `--bg-border-color`, `--content-color-light`, `--content-highlight-color-light`\n\n### Interactive States\n`--normal-bg`, `--normal-border`, `--normal-border-hover`, `--normal-text`\n\n### Accent\n`--accent-primary: #4d7c5e`, `--accent-light: #5a8f6a`, `--accent-dark: #3e694e`, `--accent-muted: #6b8f7a`, `--accent-subtle-bg: #e6ede8`\n\n### Sizing\n`--sidebar-width` (240px), `--scrollbar-width` (12px), `--control-border-radius` (4px)\n\n---\n\n## Status Colors\n\nFor data-driven UIs that need status indicators (e.g., pipeline stages, priority levels):\n\n| Status     | Color     | Hex       | Notes                     |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Success    | Forest    | `#4d7c5e` | Matches primary accent    |\n| Warning    | Amber     | `#b08a3e` | Warm gold, not bright yellow |\n| Error      | Brick     | `#b05050` | Muted red, not alarming   |\n| Info       | Slate     | `#5a7a8a` | Cool blue-gray            |\n| Neutral    | Stone     | `#8a8580` | Warm gray                 |\n\nAll status colors are desaturated to fit the subdued palette. Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

For deals, the standard stages are Lead, Qualified, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won, and Closed Lost. Tasks have priority levels of Low, Medium, High, and Urgent, with statuses of Open, In Progress, Completed, and Canceled. Deals themselves have simpler statuses: Open, Won, or Lost.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":855,"cache_read_input_tokens":92879,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":855,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0f198ce2-da73-445b-b69d-c5e50d053143","uuid":"5107c6c4-75eb-4ce0-b9e4-fc280a81f864"}

This is important for the test runner to populate the database with data before running tests. Let me look at the test spec more to understand what data needs to be seeded.\n\nBut actually, the task here is just SetupApp and DesignDatabase. The seed-db.ts will be created later when individual pages and components are being written. The test runner already handles the case where seed-db.ts doesn't exist (it checks `existsSync(seedScript)`).\n\nLet me create a basic seed-db.ts that populates the database with sample data that tests will need. \n\nActually, I should stick to just the two subtasks I was assigned. The seed script can wait until I'm writing the individual pages and components, since the test runner gracefully handles its absence. Let me refocus on completing the core setup work.\n\nThe database schema is now fully designed with all seventeen tables needed to support the CRM functionality—covering users, authentication, client management, deals, tasks, interactions, and notifications as specified in the requirements.\n\nNow I need to create a seed script for the database since the test infrastructure depends on having pre-populated data available. This falls under the database setup work I'm responsible for, so I'll build out a comprehensive seeding utility.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1059,"cache_read_input_tokens":104993,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1059,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0f198ce2-da73-445b-b69d-c5e50d053143","uuid":"eb4f7b53-8d4d-493b-92fb-5715cc35a329"}
