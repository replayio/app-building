The `schema.ts` exists as a shared module.\n\nThe job says \"Unpack: Implement package scripts\". Since `check` is already done, I need to create job groups for `deploy` and `test`. Let me add these as new job groups using the `add-group` script, and then output `<DONE>` since unpacking just means creating the sub-jobs.\n\nActually, let me re-read the strategy more carefully. The strategy for `writeScript.md` says to implement a specific script. \n\nBut this is an unpack job, so I should break it down into individual jobs for the missing scripts and queue them up.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":382,"cache_read_input_tokens":30223,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":382,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d2fd0d43-74d4-4793-90e9-5507f98524cb","uuid":"8ae67114-5a36-47ca-8dff-4bd2a14a6c30"}
