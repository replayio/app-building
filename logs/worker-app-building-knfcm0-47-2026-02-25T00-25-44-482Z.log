Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root.

Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements.

When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"33120897-563a-4c54-93f8-40700546b967","uuid":"eacc0f9e-17f1-4023-96af-88593a742d8b","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Layout likely includes a table or list of recipes with columns such as recipe name, product, version, and status. There should be controls to add, edit, and delete recipes. Selecting a recipe opens its detailed view (either inline, separate page, or modal). Each recipe contains a breakdown of raw materials and quantities required per production unit, plus possible notes or instructions. Filtering and search for recipes by name or product should be available.

The main layout is a calendar (daily/weekly/monthly views) showing each scheduled production run as an event or block. Users can click on a date to create a new production run or select an existing run to open its details page or modal. Each event shows key info such as product/recipe name, quantity, and status. The page includes navigation controls to move between weeks/months, and may integrate data from external inventory and delivery scheduling apps to visually indicate availability constraints (e.g., color coding runs with material shortages). Drag-and-drop or editing of events may be used to reschedule runs. This page is the central hub for planning when production runs occur.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdTvUTHD7IfSRxAhcbzPKXQNjVd4MGOspvJ9t0\n    13→\n    14→3.

(2) Recipe and raw materials section listing each material required, the amount needed for the planned quantity, and units. (3) Forecast/availability section showing projected inventory levels for each material at the time of the run, based on data from the separate inventory tracking and delivery scheduling apps. This may include columns like required amount, forecast available amount, shortage/excess, and any pending delivery details. (4) equipment the run will require and availability.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01PEYPWu4vzTDLj7bCNBPuQw","session_id":"33120897-563a-4c54-93f8-40700546b967","uuid":"f2d501cc-3e0f-4c48-9c83-6cdb2d1908ab"}

Now let me compile and provide you with the comprehensive information.\n\n## Comprehensive ProductionHub App Overview\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the ProductionHub codebase, here's everything you need to write the RunDetails page components:\n\n---\n\n## 1. AppSpec.md Summary\n\nThe **RunDetailsPage** (/runs/:runId) is a detailed view for a specific production run with:\n- High-level run information (ID, date/time, product, recipe, quantity, status)\n- Recipe and raw materials section listing required materials and amounts\n- Forecast/availability section showing projected inventory levels\n- Equipment required and availability\n- Links to external inventory and delivery apps\n\n---\n\n## 2. Test Specification (tests.md) - RunDetailsPage Section\n\n**Key Components to Implement:**\n- **RunHeader**: Breadcrumb navigation, high-level information card\n- **RunActions**: Adjust Quantities, Confirm Run, Cancel Run buttons\n- **RawMaterialsTable**: Materials with amounts based on planned quantity\n- **ForecastTable**: Material forecasts from external apps\n- **RunEquipmentTable**: Equipment required and availability\n- **ExternalAppLinks**: Links to inventory and delivery apps\n\n**Test Requirements Include:**\n- Breadcrumb: Home > Runs > RUN-ID (lines 603-618)\n- Display: Run ID, Date/Time, Product, Associated Recipe, Planned Quantity, Status (lines 630-658)\n- Status badges: Scheduled (blue), Confirmed (green), Cancelled (red)\n- Action buttons visible/disabled based on status (lines 687-734)\n- Raw materials table with amounts calculated from planned quantity (lines 746-757)\n- Forecast table with shortage/excess indicators (green for surplus, red for shortage) (lines 787-801)\n- Equipment table with status and notes (lines 835-836)\n- Material shortages trigger red status badges on calendar and in forecast\n\n---\n\n## 3. AppStyle.md - Design System Reference\n\n**Forest Green Minimal Design:**\n- Primary accent: `rgb(77, 124, 94)` (#4d7c5e)\n- Text primary: `rgb(38, 35, 30)` (#26231e)\n- Sidebar: `#f0eeea`\n- Buttons: 13px, 400 weight, 28px height\n- Status colors:\n  - Success/Active: Forest (#4d7c5e)\n  - Warning: Amber (#b08a3e)\n  - Error: Brick (#b05050)\n  - Info: Slate (#5a7a8a)\n- Tables: CSS Grid, 44px data rows, no visible borders\n- Badge styling by status\n\n---\n\n## 4. Database Schema (scripts/schema.ts)\n\n**Production Runs Table:**\n```typescript\nproduction_runs:\n  - id (UUID)\n  - recipe_id (UUID)\n  - start_date (TIMESTAMPTZ)\n  - end_date (TIMESTAMPTZ)\n  - planned_quantity (NUMERIC)\n  - unit (VARCHAR)\n  - status (Scheduled|Confirmed|In Progress|On Track|Material Shortage|Pending Approval|Cancelled|Completed)\n  - notes (TEXT)\n  - created_at, updated_at\n```\n\n**Run Forecasts Table:**\n```typescript\nrun_forecasts:\n  - id (UUID)\n  - run_id (UUID)\n  - material_name (VARCHAR)\n  - required_amount (NUMERIC)\n  - forecast_available (NUMERIC)\n  - unit (VARCHAR)\n  - pending_delivery (VARCHAR)\n```\n\n**Run Equipment Table:**\n```typescript\nrun_equipment:\n  - id (UUID)\n  - run_id (UUID)\n  - equipment_id (UUID)\n  - status (VARCHAR)\n  - notes (TEXT)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Type Definitions (src/types/index.ts)\n\n```typescript\nexport type RunStatus =\n  | \"Scheduled\" | \"Confirmed\" | \"In Progress\" | \"On Track\"\n  | \"Material Shortage\" | \"Pending Approval\" | \"Cancelled\" | \"Completed\"\n\nexport interface ProductionRun {\n  id: string\n  recipe_id: string\n  recipe_name?: string\n  product_name?: string\n  start_date: string\n  end_date: string\n  planned_quantity: number\n  unit: string\n  status: RunStatus\n  notes: string\n  created_at: string\n  updated_at: string\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Redux Pattern\n\n**Slice Structure Pattern (see equipmentSlice.ts & recipesSlice.ts):**\n- `createAsyncThunk` for async operations\n- Netlify functions at `/.netlify/functions/<resource>`\n- `createSlice` with extraReducers for async handling\n- Selectors via `useAppSelector` hook\n- Dispatch via `useAppDispatch` hook\n\n**You'll need to create: `runsSlice.ts`** with:\n```typescript\n- fetchRuns() - GET /.netlify/functions/runs\n- fetchRunById(id) - GET /.netlify/functions/runs/:id\n- updateRun(data) - PUT /.netlify/functions/runs/:id\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Component Patterns\n\n**Header Components (RecipeDetailHeader.tsx, EquipmentDetailHeader.tsx):**\n- Use `Breadcrumb` from `@shared/components/Breadcrumb`\n- Display title with ID\n- Action button on the right (Edit, Add, etc.)\n- Modal patterns for forms\n\n**Info Components (EquipmentInfo.tsx):**\n- Local state for edit modes\n- useEffect to sync with props when data changes\n- Separate edit and display views\n- Form groups with labels\n- Save/Cancel button pairs\n\n**Table Patterns:**\n- CSS Grid layout\n- 44px tall rows\n- Hover states with `rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.05)` background\n- Column headers with semantic naming\n\n---\n\n## 8.

Netlify Functions Pattern\n\n**Pattern from equipment.ts & recipes.ts:**\n- GET with optional ID: fetch one or all\n- POST: create with validation\n- PUT: update with COALESCE for partial updates\n- DELETE: remove by ID\n- Handle query params via `url.searchParams`\n- Return JSON with appropriate status codes\n- Error handling with try/catch\n\n**For Runs, you'll create: `netlify/functions/runs.ts`**\n\n---\n\n## 10.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

Let me plan the implementation:\n\n1. First, I need to create the backend function `netlify/functions/runs.ts` for handling CRUD operations on production runs, including fetching related data (forecasts, equipment, recipe materials)\n2. Create the `runsSlice.ts` Redux slice \n3. Add the runs reducer to the store\n4. Create each component:\n   - RunHeader\n   - RunActions\n   - RawMaterialsTable\n   - ForecastTable\n   - RunEquipmentTable\n   - ExternalAppLinks\n5. Create the RunDetailsPage\n\n\n6. Update App.tsx to use the real RunDetailsPage\n\nI need to map out the data structure carefully. The production run will need to pull in the recipe name and product name through joins, then fetch the recipe materials to calculate amounts based on the planned quantity, along with the run forecasts and equipment assignments with their names.\n\nNow I'm working through each piece systematically, starting with the backend function since everything depends on it. I'll need to define the types for RunForecast, RunEquipmentItem, and a comprehensive RunDetail object, then trace through the test spec to ensure the data shape matches what each component expects—the header needs run ID and status, the materials table multiplies recipe amounts by planned quantity, the forecast table shows shortages and pending deliveries, and the equipment table displays status and notes.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1914,"cache_read_input_tokens":84994,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1914,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"33120897-563a-4c54-93f8-40700546b967","uuid":"ff4988cd-3f2e-4f6e-bdee-90f9a23e0839"}
