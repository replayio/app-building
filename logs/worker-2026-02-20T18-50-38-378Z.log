Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1","uuid":"39ac8fe9-d132-48d1-b161-97f69033e31f","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n    23→- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n    24→\n    25→## Finished\n    26→\n    27→2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n    28→- Before: 1e5a771\n    29→- After: (this commit)\n    30→- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    31→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n    32→\n    33→2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n    34→- Before: 1e5a771\n    35→- After: (this commit)\n    36→- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    37→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n    38→\n    39→2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n    40→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    41→- After: (this commit)\n    42→- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    43→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    44→\n    45→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    46→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    47→- After: (this commit)\n    48→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    49→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    50→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    51→\n    52→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    53→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    54→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    55→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    56→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    57→\n    58→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    59→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    60→\n    61→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    62→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    63→\n    64→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    65→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    66→\n    67→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    68→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    69→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    70→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    71→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    72→\n    73→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    74→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    75→- Before: df7222c\n    76→- After: c0847d0\n    77→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    78→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n    79→\n    80→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n    81→- Before: ef67c9a\n    82→- After: (this commit)\n    83→- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n    84→- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n    85→- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n    86→\n    87→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n    88→- Before: 4e63501\n    89→- After: (this commit)\n    90→- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n    91→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n    92→\n    93→2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n    94→- Before: fbafcda\n    95→- After: (this commit)\n    96→- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n    97→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n    98→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n    99→\n   100→\n   101→\n   102→2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n   103→- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n   104→- Before: fc47dd2\n   105→- After: 8b82e35\n   106→- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n   107→- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n   108→\n   109→2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n   110→- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n   111→- Before: 78daa0a\n   112→- After: fc47dd2\n   113→- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n   114→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n   115→- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n   116→\n   117→2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n   118→- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n   119→- Before: 78daa0a\n   120→- After: fc47dd2\n   121→- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n   122→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n   123→- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n   124→\n   125→2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n   126→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n   127→- Before: 78daa0a\n   128→- After: fc47dd2\n   129→- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar.

Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n   138→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n   139→- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n   140→\n   141→2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n   142→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n   143→- Before: 0301f38\n   144→- After: 0cd095c\n   145→- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n   146→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n   147→- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n   148→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01XqgHyXmmX8cND2yq7Sud8R","session_id":"feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1","uuid":"57a53a10-c7cb-48d8-9498-7b3962410d85"}

Two sections:\n    46→1. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    47→2. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    48→\n    49→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    50→\n    51→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    52→\n    53→## Team Page and User Management\n    54→\n    55→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    56→\n    57→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    58→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01XqgHyXmmX8cND2yq7Sud8R","session_id":"feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1","uuid":"e735f312-fbab-42a1-bc22-39a7169b41f7"}

Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence.

Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    31→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n    32→\n    33→2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n    34→- Before: 1e5a771\n    35→- After: (this commit)\n    36→- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n    37→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n    38→\n    39→2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n    40→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    41→- After: (this commit)\n    42→- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    43→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    44→\n    45→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    46→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    47→- After: (this commit)\n    48→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    49→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    50→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    51→\n    52→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    53→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    54→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    55→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    56→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    57→\n    58→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    59→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    60→\n    61→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    62→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    63→\n    64→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    65→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    66→\n    67→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    68→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    69→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    70→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    71→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    72→\n    73→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    74→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    75→- Before: df7222c\n    76→- After: c0847d0\n    77→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    78→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n    79→\n    80→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n    81→- Before: ef67c9a\n    82→- After: (this commit)\n    83→- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n    84→- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n    85→- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n    86→\n    87→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n    88→- Before: 4e63501\n    89→- After: (this commit)\n    90→- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n    91→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n    92→\n    93→2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n    94→- Before: fbafcda\n    95→- After: (this commit)\n    96→- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n    97→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n    98→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n    99→\n   100→\n   101→\n   102→2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n   103→- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n   104→- Before: fc47dd2\n   105→- After: 8b82e35\n   106→- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n   107→- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n   108→\n   109→2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n   110→- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n   111→- Before: 78daa0a\n   112→- After: fc47dd2\n   113→- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation.

Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n- Before: 0cd095c\n- After: 78daa0a\n- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior. Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n\n2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n- Before: 0301f38\n- After: 0cd095c\n- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n","numLines":148,"startLine":1,"totalLines":148}}}

Now I have all the information. Let me create a comprehensive summary of my findings:\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nI've completed a thorough search of the `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/` directory. Here are all the relevant files:\n\n### 1. Main App with Routing\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`\n```tsx\nimport { Routes, Route, Navigate } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport { AppLayout } from './components/layout/AppLayout'\nimport { ClientsListPage } from './pages/ClientsListPage'\nimport { ClientDetailPage } from './pages/ClientDetailPage'\nimport { PersonDetailPage } from './pages/PersonDetailPage'\nimport { DealsListPage } from './pages/DealsListPage'\nimport { DealDetailPage } from './pages/DealDetailPage'\nimport { TasksListPage } from './pages/TasksListPage'\nimport { TaskDetailPage } from './pages/TaskDetailPage'\nimport { SettingsPage } from './pages/SettingsPage'\nimport { UsersListPage } from './pages/UsersListPage'\nimport { UserDetailPage } from './pages/UserDetailPage'\nimport { NotFoundPage } from './pages/NotFoundPage'\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <Routes>\n      <Route element={<AppLayout />}>\n        <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navigate to=\"/clients\" replace />} />\n        <Route path=\"/clients\" element={<ClientsListPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/clients/:clientId\" element={<ClientDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/individuals/:individualId\" element={<PersonDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/deals\" element={<DealsListPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/deals/:dealId\" element={<DealDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/tasks\" element={<TasksListPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/tasks/:taskId\" element={<TaskDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/settings\" element={<SettingsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/users\" element={<UsersListPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/users/:userId\" element={<UserDetailPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"*\" element={<NotFoundPage />} />\n      </Route>\n    </Routes>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Key Observation:** No `/auth/` routes currently defined. All routes wrapped in `<AppLayout />`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Existing Auth Tests\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\nFull content (118 lines) - includes tests for:\n- `AUTH-USR-01`: Sidebar displays authenticated user info\n- `AUTH-USR-02`: Sidebar displays sign-in button when not logged in\n- `AUTH-USR-03`: App loads without authentication\n- `AUTH-E2E-01`: Full signup and login flow end-to-end\n\nUses test utilities from `'./base'` and validates:\n- Sidebar user area visibility\n- Auth form visibility\n- Sign in/up/out flows\n\n---\n\n### 3. Package.json - Resend Dependency Status\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/package.json`\n\n**✓ Resend is ALREADY a dependency:**\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"resend\": \"^6.9.2\",\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOther relevant auth dependencies:\n- `jose`: `^6.1.3` (JWT handling)\n- `react-hook-form`: `^7.71.1` (Form handling)\n- `@hookform/resolvers`: `^5.2.2` (Form validation)\n- `zod`: `^4.3.6` (Schema validation)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Auth Context and Token Management\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`\n\nProvides:\n- `useAuth()` hook with `isLoggedIn`, `loading`, `user`, `signIn()`, `signUp()`, `signOut()`\n- Makes calls to `/.netlify/functions/auth?action=me|signup|login`\n- Stores token in localStorage under key `auth-token`\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/lib/auth.ts`\n\nUtility functions:\n- `getToken()` / `setToken()` / `removeToken()` - localStorage management\n- Auto-injects `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header to all `/.netlify/functions/` requests\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/auth/RequireAuth.tsx`\n\nRoute protection component - redirects to `/login` if not authenticated (currently doesn't exist).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Backend Auth Handler\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/auth.ts`\n\nHandles:\n- `GET ?action=me` - Returns current user from JWT token\n- `POST ?action=signup` - Creates new user with hashed password\n- `POST ?action=login` - Authenticates user and returns JWT\n\nUses:\n- `scryptSync` for password hashing (with salt)\n- `jose` library for JWT generation/verification\n- JWT expiration: 7 days\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/auth.ts`\n\nProvides:\n- `optionalAuth()` - Optional JWT verification middleware\n- `requiresAuth()` - Required JWT verification middleware\n- `UserRecord` interface\n\n---\n\n### 6. Email Utility (Already Configured for Email Flows)\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/email.ts`\n\n**Already has email sending functions prepared:**\n- `sendConfirmationEmail(email, token)` - Sends confirmation link to `/auth/confirm-email?token=${token}`\n- `sendPasswordResetEmail(email, token)` - Sends reset link to `/auth/reset-password?token=${token}`\n\nUses `resend` library with:\n- From: `'Sales CRM <noreply@updates.nut.new>'`\n- Graceful fallback if `RESEND_API_KEY` not set (logs link to console)\n\n---\n\n### 7. Database Schema - Auth Tables\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/schema.ts`\n\nAlready defined:\n\n**`users` table:**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  auth_user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  name TEXT NOT NULL,\n  password_hash TEXT,\n  provider TEXT DEFAULT 'email',\n  avatar_url TEXT DEFAULT '',\n  email_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n)\n```\n\n**`email_tokens` table:**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS email_tokens (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('confirm', 'reset')),\n  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,\n  used_at TIMESTAMPTZ,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8.

Email Utility (Already Configured for Email Flows)\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/email.ts`\n\n**Already has email sending functions prepared:**\n- `sendConfirmationEmail(email, token)` - Sends confirmation link to `/auth/confirm-email?token=${token}`\n- `sendPasswordResetEmail(email, token)` - Sends reset link to `/auth/reset-password?token=${token}`\n\nUses `resend` library with:\n- From: `'Sales CRM <noreply@updates.nut.new>'`\n- Graceful fallback if `RESEND_API_KEY` not set (logs link to console)\n\n---\n\n### 7. Database Schema - Auth Tables\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/schema.ts`\n\nAlready defined:\n\n**`users` table:**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  auth_user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  name TEXT NOT NULL,\n  password_hash TEXT,\n  provider TEXT DEFAULT 'email',\n  avatar_url TEXT DEFAULT '',\n  email_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n)\n```\n\n**`email_tokens` table:**\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS email_tokens (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),\n  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('confirm', 'reset')),\n  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,\n  used_at TIMESTAMPTZ,\n  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. Pages Status\n**Existing pages (no auth pages yet):**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientsListPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientDetailPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/PersonDetailPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealsListPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/DealDetailPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TasksListPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/TaskDetailPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/UsersListPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/UserDetailPage.tsx`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/NotFoundPage.tsx`\n\n**Missing auth pages:**\n- `ConfirmEmailPage` - needs to be created at `/src/pages/ConfirmEmailPage.tsx`\n- `ResetPasswordPage` - needs to be created at `/src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx`\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings Summary\n\n1. **Resend is already installed** (v6.9.2)\n2. **Email sending functions already exist** in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/email.ts` with correct routes\n3. **Database tables already defined** for `users` and `email_tokens`\n4. **Auth infrastructure complete**: JWT handling, password hashing, auth middleware\n5. **No `/auth/` routes in main App.tsx** - needs to be added\n6. **No confirm-email or reset-password pages exist** - need to be created\n7. **Tests already exist** for sign-in/sign-up flows but test email confirmation endpoints\n\nAll absolute file paths are ready for implementation work."}],"totalDurationMs":35115,"totalTokens":34291,"totalToolUseCount":23,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2986,"cache_read_input_tokens":29017,"output_tokens":2285,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2986},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me plan the implementation:\n\n## What needs to be done for FixBug:\n\n### Backend changes:\n1. **Update `auth.ts` function** to:\n   - Signup: Don't return a session immediately. Instead, create an email confirmation token, send confirmation email, and return a message saying \"check your email\"\n   - Add `?action=confirm-email` endpoint to verify the token and mark user as confirmed\n   - Add `?action=forgot-password` endpoint to send reset email\n   - Add `?action=reset-password` endpoint to reset password with token\n   - Login: Check that `email_confirmed` is true before allowing login (except in test mode)\n\n2. **Frontend changes:**\n   - Update AuthProvider to handle the new signup flow where the token isn't returned immediately\n   - Add \"Forgot password\" link to the sidebar auth form\n   - Create confirmation and password reset page components that handle the token-based flows\n   - Add the corresponding routes and update the sidebar to guide users through these new flows\n\n3. **Database and email utilities** are already in place with the confirmation and reset functionality.\n\nNow I need to think through the test strategy. In test mode, requiring email confirmation will break the existing signup and login flow since users won't be able to log in until they confirm their email. I could either auto-confirm users in test mode to keep tests working, or have tests explicitly hit the confirmation endpoint. Auto-confirming seems simpler and less disruptive to the existing test suite.\n\nLet me start implementing this approach.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3539,"cache_read_input_tokens":49179,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3539,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":12,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1","uuid":"999df75c-5c1e-466f-aadc-68e791f95554"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.

The issue might be in the playwright config's `projects` section.

But the Replay reporter says \"None of the configured projects ran using Replay Chromium\" — this is a warning, not an error. The bigger issue is 0 tests.\n\n\nThe JSON reporter output shows `totalTests: 0` at the start of the run, which suggests test discovery isn't finding any tests even though they're clearly defined in the codebase. The run ends with a failed status, but it's unclear if that's because no tests were discovered or if something else is preventing them from running.\n\nLet me examine the global-setup file to see if there's an initialization issue preventing the tests from being discovered or executed properly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4480,"cache_read_input_tokens":98677,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4480,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1","uuid":"2db951b8-bcf6-4572-a4bf-f9072d8b96a4"}

The project is named `[REDACTED]-chromium` but uses `devices['Desktop Chrome']`, not the Replay browser. This means the Replay reporter's check for \"Replay Chromium\" fails. But that shouldn't cause 0 tests.\n\nActually wait — the fact that `totalTests: 0` is logged means `suite.allTests()` returns 0 tests. This seems like a configuration issue where test files aren't being matched.\n\nThe config has `testDir: './tests'` and we're running `npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.ts`. \n\nWhen projects are defined, each one can have its own test matching rules, though the global `testDir` still applies. The real problem might be that the project is configured to use `devices['Desktop Chrome']` with a `channel: 'chrome'` setting, which requires Google Chrome to be installed — if Chrome isn't available, the project could fail silently and not pick up any tests. The command `npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.ts --retries 0` might not match properly if the project configuration is incompatible.\n\nLooking at the config more carefully, the `projects` section specifies a `[REDACTED]-chromium` project that uses `devices['Desktop Chrome']`, which includes the standard Chrome channel setting. This overrides the global `use` configuration that had the Replay Chromium executable path, so the project loses those Replay settings and tries to use standard Chrome instead. Even so, this shouldn't prevent the tests from being found — the `totalTests: 0` result suggests something else is going wrong.\n\nThe most likely culprit is that Chrome isn't installed on the system, causing the browser to fail launching and all tests to be filtered out. Let me run the tests directly to see what error actually surfaces, or verify whether Chrome is available.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1685,"cache_read_input_tokens":103157,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1685,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1","uuid":"a566d46f-326d-47b5-9faa-585857646811"}

That should work since we saw the browser at `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome` and HOME is `/repo/.agent-home`.\n\nBut the issue might be that when we spread the device config, the project `use` overrides properties from the global `use`. \n\nLooking at the error more carefully — the [REDACTED]Reporter is warning that no projects ran with Replay Chromium and `totalTests: 0`. The issue seems to be that the Replay Chromium executable path isn't being picked up correctly, even though it's specified in the device config.\n\nLet me try a different approach — I'll strip out the `projects` configuration entirely and just use the global `use` settings to see if that resolves the browser launch issue.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1698,"cache_read_input_tokens":108452,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1698,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1","uuid":"933afa8f-81c1-49e8-9f7a-40be7e469903"}

The isSignUp variable is not accessible from the logpoint. Let me try a different approach. The function is being called 16 times, which seems too many. Let me check the actual flow:\n\n1. The test clicks the submit button\n2. The form calls handleSubmit\n3. handleSubmit calls signUp (but signUp is from AuthProvider's context)\n4. signUp calls fetch\n\nThe fact that line 86 in AuthProvider.tsx had 0 hits but line 34 in Sidebar had 16 hits is surprising. Perhaps the issue is that the signUp function from the context is stale or something?\n\n\nThe logpoint expression returned the template literal as a plain string instead of interpolating it, so I need to try a simpler expression. More importantly, I should check what the signUp function from useAuth() is actually doing - it might not be calling fetch at all. Let me look at the network requests to see if the signup API call is even being made.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":955,"cache_read_input_tokens":125709,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":955,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1","uuid":"f0f32535-a581-4023-9bc6-345cecd77bb8"}

[2026-02-20T18:37:29.566Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Rd9MegLTrjMQbaEEQQSMDH","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The error is: `IS_TEST is set but tests/test-branch-data.json not found in any expected location`. The issue is that the test branch data file was cleaned up after the test run but the dev server is still running with `IS_TEST=true`. But this happens during the test run too, so the problem should be in the test run itself.\n\nWait - let me look at the error more carefully. The error is happening on line 81 of auth.ts in the compiled output, which corresponds to the `const sql = getDb()` call on line 81 of our auth.ts. This is the line where `getDb()` is called inside the `POST ?action=confirm-email` handler.\n\n\nActually, I think I see the real issue now. The `getDb()` call was moved to the top of the POST handler before the action check, whereas it used to only be called inside specific handlers like signup and login. When the Netlify dev server caches the old function code, it can't find the test branch data file that's needed for the database initialization.\n\nBut wait—the test creates the branch data file before running, so it should be available during the test. The manual curl test failing makes sense since I didn't have the test data set up, but that's different from the test run itself.\n\nLooking at the test script flow more carefully: it kills stale processes first, then creates the test branch and writes the data file. The issue might be that `reuseExistingServer: true` in the Playwright config is reusing a stale Netlify dev server from before the test branch was created.\n\nActually, let me trace through what happens step by step. The test script kills old processes, creates the test branch, writes the data file, updates the environment, then runs Playwright. Playwright starts the dev server with `IS_TEST=true` and `DATABASE_URL` unset, which tells `getDb()` to read from the test data file instead. Since the file exists at that point, the setup should work. But the signup endpoint is returning 500 during the test, which suggests something else is going wrong.\n\nLooking at the passing tests more carefully - most of them don't actually make API calls. AUTH-FP-02 is the only one that does make an API call to the forgot-password endpoint, and it passes. So the API layer is working for at least that endpoint, which means the issue is specific to the signup request. The forgot-password endpoint passes its test even though both it and signup call `getDb()` on the same line, so there's something else going on—maybe the Netlify dev server is caching or reloading differently between requests.\n\nLooking at the actual error and the webServer configuration, the dev server starts with `IS_TEST=true` but unsets `DATABASE_URL`, then tries to find the test data file that might not exist yet or isn't in the expected location when the function first runs.\n\nThe interesting part is that 8 other tests pass while AUTH-E2E-01 fails with a 500 error, which suggests the dev server is working but something specific about the signup flow is triggering the missing test data error. Let me trace through what AUTH-E2E-01 does: it navigates to /clients, waits for the page to load, then clicks sign-in and toggles to signup.\n\nThe real issue might be that when the signup POST hits the backend, the `IS_TEST` environment variable is set but the test data file isn't in the location where db.ts is looking for it. I should check where exactly the function is trying to find that file.","signature":"Er43CkYICxgCKkAMUvTvolH3nQmEJeUI1QDMgXCcfeWGIwYnuu6IBmKvNRCP4eyxk401C0tcNwgNOFwmjgAYVKJjYMVWRjAGSVqwEgzEquLCLmvyNqdAYcgaDOOpp/9gLZdXzwBYqCIwOdGGaSleH/f2Lc7aW0TtP8eUFaTPEMRdRxPEp7jU4Pmii1p6Z8Z/60y2Mi3xLivvKqU2jaZnS9/OFo/CfkChFybKE6w2/gp/Fhd+pO8WJF7fiTACHHfzRbKv4kwQyjGkQzgA9VByaIhsyRwzCr1psCkfSFyl9ojuByeit3O1NxswdxVTJ5cU4YVFTCrqa2ppA8Zo2AMMfcpWIwkF2Rs9uPmKAVOI5QgNdPsLEtQKYIFaYrYaL/j8Epi5NgoKVnSbcJ8n498+d5OEEFbwB1dKok5zs8BySqyG3o8B6W6I9P+GVVddMKBzg8g2AORjFwj7hZtjOYJck9bLbLppoSDyhZNXggZoB1rK/aHj0NiOzAsSClqoLRYrT7e+B4Qu4lWW9Kh/ZlXkK228QXXXOwf3juej8GzNOFlxQUlz2ZY/8oL27tlqIEZAw/nexsseEd2WI+Xmc0havniGFMg1CrGNZDW7lBGZeIy3jVD72h/qmE/vN1d00id2aLmPgjjCcTtx8Sg/bLAN096Do+5aGCHUaw4BrzcRJFFWnsYmVJ1EdSW/gbkUSXfc/bxAUp+sMaD7I0SdCotmx5KDCm3JNzEFSl1I+LZ2r9fVizgXDAoGxWE7KuQpun+atm8/btbv5uxOKPRhLKOKWVZTI03CU7v5VLkF/poapvn+6G12Ggt1ThSz5E1bZXWhNg+PHi9SKUFqNS7K4qRi/VnnclzqkZ5WvR5AjL9kHX9CfTSCeY6jY488G0RVJOetMPcaRBxzoo3SZUZNOBqLM4dDeAmvnzYCi+2RzhiBR4LnoZ7x0JBW2dqZ/M4YgkgiAI6friG7ynPE8pfwr9e13FcXoBCt/JBIh6XOqEhEogAeHBthDs/ZLJso1ZaBdrFE0Fm+u8hKumKx+uu5+v072PWPnUCQYuH/peiSEBi5hDLj+fiJfiKiJ9NgGssKtTit57OqspIZHiPtahk+rQsCOOoL2lgpC9kbzogtldkhBIOzUKEQdmR/Io+LYNwbPHFPIdUE45tz8dbxpZYOp7YbORCw4fLiqZl2WoAahxHN3v82ByhL327kA7OqICjyE6B+Sr73rQcvfe2iZ5ua2KMDY/RaM9mVfGsEh1oJkouyK/xmCyWj+q6DI/bYarqYXLrT/VVVnYDNl8tBhkc0GYIR8q8pstlsb6pjSbZNrEcMe2f0unUov0I9ulApZCTlrJo7+4axz/2KV7pQsL54/9HWEahz3d9jDjBx4+hy1oYl6w1gOVsCWX95dfz1MycnPxSCrrx82DAiynSqQie34mVE3HVFthAtZ0rZE1+YFmgYg6pfEw7gwT7A3WKjOZ6ZIh61p+88PrPSaZUe2k/VFWC5sffShFo4tFUBRXXMt9Y+IZgrHwaKbdVFk1+FDMQ83ZyqJ4VKQduLYCrCMKK1j6I3kedR2t2lYSdmglE9zS1hGLTAwu2y0uRpbTIjoxo21QKr/6uSADo9GyuNkJc/q6bKkDvM58917GIvhqqTEpJ5G1iqkJYb9619vVzIENLZiBOasXe33wLnWuVN12ZXfrSh9Us7JFtNVeBLkBBp32kBwnrFNXgigj+riSmBXG9D5Fe/tS6nqc5tcNVL8Bgaj2QB8uzkeYM0tLyxMqwy+BaYoP33Y4eKmQwmeByVi4cRzQcfjDEySZKxG6jOO7uSv5z9lC4PGhUMUmC1o/oof1HSap/tduINwmN39U+B34HNIqgjhlTP0/TQ6tH1IYEct7cApqp1oheBsHhftmKjmXhplFxJg3aV17xy+VQt+sFeI0Hlhgo0zjdb3nM+RMYQjn652KMlpKiov1KU2mU0omakg/ZWXSibbcnbbsbWCjcbCMk1knFpxtqHkFbcfgZKNGgUtxSW9GWyUTFoH1HWqGVMlsFFQKEMC0HeZK4wPphlZRZRVfuOHCnNxPGEM2fqGrVpVxgpuCg/erqlp6himHy+k0EybgTXVz+14mp20tWJUjFYwQJdDvP0pg/rYDHTmYehJ2LiAXY6bu8cJRdOsrIPn53/56/k2M2KKZNImMQzbrcsYEfXrRCrTjiDkwPX/XWwW6qXvBXN9MCGmBhxRIep/ujbbHgrt1C//6fwvoqoIYFvL4GZ6X0p7hEvvzUdiS/Tui37FD7Jn0LyUeODtH88glBQtMxeVly4woR2kNoKybtoyCcowZL+8X2ppvea8tIHpsSTKbPJHh1WPRGV/zLzmSCxN8aVBV78E2uCkI/y8J7Yc+jqk2CUeaylNZLLtUP94pq2Kb2RzhWLosccrdWm9V7qDbBVOW7gh1U7WbI5qEshRczxlz6GXvwygLZOGVusmNpk2Qfui6AP25kklcyzNPXvUmOj3m4Djg0qjXXvQuRcnskrJLK8IgvOetgK9hJDi7drURsm8lqVt9cVca79/nkcXajpXUgBseSeHVxpWJP7KMIP2dcRtOfWh/q0nGeYdprUEX7u41gpO51uanzY2E24U8X7vyWnOJJ+N9tvjg6hAK/49RmJRb84ecJGl2crOdwdXM2ZBkNXqJ4a/1OWV4/obVQNZbsG7b/NIatyaUxlIjSnn/9/+amIx+X0xzmvh4MDUgo07jM20Rtf8KpArI9WvDkF4Hx68xXT08O9SZ4Tj2Qb+3/k0iVucFGST+PW7mj42ilJlneTrd6RghdpB2CnYh6LEqqaaAOeWV8RYg1nL+Ra9sochEb9Y49LHOONpxYfL22OreV4hypwM6sf0Kroa6dY+zlIt9MQ9o4Lkz9HqqUDTUV9b66ZItUZb9zyWqzAGx1ZI7+q05QlBjiMk5YLnsPhDcr350ABnjCNJgDMykCKlMLOjTkD0bV2VcB3SmsyjIEFHuwk0ExABuOOXj29RzGJm2ryKL2Wwrjh/fp8+8+4oVzKNIeS3YS+azk2RCwaLBChzNpg4GZIUx/XUEpO71qsCAVnt810IV4SZleW78Vw0dxPfaTMu/1ezj2oR8tqRR/RAcqwhJH4cLaYWSL7b7lUBfPeDxZJLYW4rcUTdYnepwiptnt0x/BkW0yrcT/JCk7rF9HisTG9+dXYel/76QcQtilGWTFC1MXBs/O2HhAdZBBndFS9cxm2c8uTdQ8In3gQBrIk5Zw+VUX/Nw53Yk3mPsUO+UKvotoqeO+69GZURC98avvQxEqC85Cxo716Fm6NdKVhrYv9pMgb80Wd5YmXgba9/X4VgN6nJWL8p5uMn8or59UCUr49vGSrjD0dHpSIrjuC8WoYB159nVg85LIN0c2TDDmLqp+uwGp3w4pmXF44rjvlGekfDWTiVU+5vxXjppyaGvwV7NOipERs6ikGSoTFguT7VW9b9M2cvn09n2f505JwT5lBlAHWhTTc0MerDaXHz9/bM8XqEr4L5UfbYJ3f91lJAkd0o+07i6qw/+JAPMtnRAtnybFG1huBKOddPWSVQ3KGV3MEJELccZG8qC2vO9i1iSJtbQUShl6Gz9k7MpVMgIan62FTWyl6RmvUBMZpP/qD9GjAIQOliyfaSFVGdM53kXpm3g04aQ0mlBqUjwCByklQu68fiq+KJJ16GinwTbP4Z4xVMmU0HcpNpTNGx7tZYj/rCoqVfgTpyVJQvXf9arvEpUxB/8nPhzIXaQH7hLqXJo5T4htAc3ZGPKPV1YXZqLR+pIAqhdbuJ1edWr6/6cQ2eNOdXLtftYqb/SNM12+IFWjPq2bS6zu+KQunBXzeOQpU+ZdsZzp9lyw5Sch9GScShaBTo7Hfi8BUoctm+xRL9gx28EuWtflVLc7u7NcMlgMsgua5Z6Jl2JDNUaHx4yTv9l6DAU1i/ApTo12cfj5Csx7l4gtKFRWpHN2+aU/RpRf3NuGRKqT6bug/bErDT0cEtoq8RuZnEiezmAqjW801pAocADL5xSWfY2P149h7Q24syxMCMtdvY5ngGyHB7lLYtvNxX2tpAbMPHbkOHB7icSl32gZDe5lD2UtEKZKqjTa20pX/lSfhfmH3mr4EXw0VVpmvTSFMuvQlAN1petxKYUJPSOdUW97WUCN85HTKESfmrExJWedLNiEuILEEekUlFAGjQ/8AD46bT7AK41eAH/nySfcb5YE9yl6+hxkn/1WGKuaNw9s2iqemR8loFWw2PWNeSjryxEQstsq89PGEPZuW9AUEL88bhlRDZJtdHvzgEFLCPsLWIgdJmbeexQGkVt021utBcZR3xLvZDs1ezZr9GBS3SRNnRH3YuIhcsjgavvnPTZALAWnk8fHdPuaNoYyoGyKLQ50Ls4yi4clvkVw4rdPrODwjc9FgcWbm08jZvjKgeRDIznkULffGtb3+Pl287WEE1s7kaTKiKi2weXVnxaMVAeN6Mrwupg+vShAg/EZtlczscPoT2UaMOJTY6yl2Rrt6zhMm1OoSwurTmj6JguntNK9BTBzWoWJoqp5+Zr4okd6KG4EuG1arsldeN5vq9Tuhe8/cPpKJyKZa5UF9qrGooDLRGFRg8NIQLDAXIG+RvprKY1qBXfPdYF6/7Q35LDwo5XjHDatHXsyHNlOsRdivuf6IQURqu3XJSDhZRL4g2yj56Z6kEBlE9ij/eXMoTn3pxT0wqrtKrRtTbuePcEHBk6o45eWuRS+59FsD4Hy3c8zpE/HtCqejurzDmQs8CCLNcsI+/UyV2sKo/rSXsyYkG3QYokdgD1U83Zrorp/rmBCLcDQsOQ8SbzfKhzUwJWSM1aWHM1SS1UdsjDzQwRO3kCaYp7w219Mk3lFTb4gY5pSvsmeX4wxbpl0Xqa9/ScvGIokfOL9benuIHNqiUaUqpABwpEwhenpS8AGy8/WDCQ/mrucs+YMd2dPrSHMzbV3Yuuwbnpqx6OqPhPSqEkNPkNlQevHs

The first time it's called, it reads the file. If the file doesn't exist (because the test script cleanup already ran), it throws.\n\nBut wait - the 8 other tests pass, including AUTH-FP-02 which makes an API call to the backend that calls `getDb()`. So the file IS accessible during the test run.\n\nLooking at the test results timeline:\n- AUTH-RP-01: passed at 18:34:17.707 (duration: 3548ms)\n- AUTH-RP-02: passed at 18:34:18.062 (duration: 3836ms) \n\n\n- AUTH-USR-03: passed at 18:34:18.177 (duration: 4022ms)\n- AUTH-FP-01: passed at 18:34:18.627 (duration: 4443ms)\n- AUTH-USR-02: passed at 18:34:18.762 (duration: 4532ms)\n- AUTH-USR-01: passed at 18:34:18.906 (duration: 4679ms)\n- AUTH-FP-02: passed at 18:34:19.124 (duration: 4752ms)\n- AUTH-CE-01: passed at 18: 34:19.798 (duration: 1978ms)\n- AUTH-E2E-01: failed at 18:34:29.056 (duration: 14617ms)\n\nAUTH-E2E-01 took over 14 seconds and failed, likely the last test to run. The signup POST probably happened around 4-5 seconds in, so roughly 18:34:18 or so. But AUTH-FP-02 made an API call and passed at 18:34:19, meaning the backend was responsive then. The real question is whether the test run hits the same error I'm seeing in my manual curl test, or if something else is going wrong.\n\nLooking at the recording more carefully, I see the response status was 500 and then `res.json()` threw an error. A 500 from Netlify dev usually means the function itself threw an error, likely because it couldn't find the test-branch-data.json file. But here's the thing - when Netlify dev bundles and runs the function, the working directory and path resolution might be different from what I expect. The bundled function might have a different `process.cwd()` than the source code, which could explain why the file path isn't resolving correctly. The function runs from `.netlify/functions-serve/auth/`, so the relative path should resolve to `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/test-branch-data.json` if the CWD is set correctly. But I'm wondering if this could be a timing issue with Netlify dev—maybe the function caches the path on first load, and if it gets reloaded or hot-reloaded, the cached value becomes stale or the file becomes unreadable. Let me just retry the tests to see if it's a one-off issue.\n\nI also need to check the Playwright config since I removed the `projects` section and should verify that the `devices` import isn't sitting there unused.","signature":"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

But the problem might be that different Netlify function instances have separate modules - each function is bundled separately, so each function's `db.ts` module has its own `_testDbUrl` cache.\n\nWhen `auth` is first loaded, if the test-branch-data.json file exists, it should be found. The error we see is happening because the file doesn't exist at any of those paths.\n\nBut other functions work - the `AUTH-FP-02` test makes a call to `auth?action=forgot-password` and it works. \n\nBoth tests hit the same `auth` function and should share the same `_testDbUrl` cache, so that's not the issue. The function is definitely loaded before the requests come in based on the logs. The real difference is that `AUTH-FP-02` succeeds with a forgot-password action while `AUTH-E2E-01` fails with a signup action, even though they're both POST requests to the same function.\n\nLet me check if the forgot-password handler actually reaches the database or if it's returning early. Looking at the forgot-password logic, it validates the email parameter and queries the users table... I'm realizing that `getDb()` is called at the very start of the handler on line 81, so if it fails, it would break all requests—not just signup. But the forgot-password test passes, which means `getDb()` must be working. The test file exists throughout the entire test run, so that's not the issue. I'm wondering if the Netlify dev server is doing something with function compilation that's causing the problem.\n\nWhen Netlify dev loads a function, it creates a new module instance with its own cache for `_testDbUrl`. If the function gets reloaded between requests, the cache would be cleared. But the source files haven't changed, so there shouldn't be a reload. Maybe the issue is that `IS_TEST=true` isn't being passed to the environment properly, or the function is failing to locate the file for some other reason.\n\nLet me reconsider this. The webServer command unsets `DATABASE_URL` and sets `IS_TEST=true`, but Netlify dev also loads environment variables from `.env`. When the test script updates `.env` with the test database URL, the webServer sees both `IS_TEST=true` and `DATABASE_URL` from the file. The `getDb()` function checks `IS_TEST` first—if it's `'true'`, it tries to read the test data file, and if that file doesn't exist, it throws an error.\n\nSo the intermittent failures likely stem from the test data file path. The test script creates `test-branch-data.json` at `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/test-branch-data.json`, but the code is checking for it at a relative path like `tests/test-branch-data.json`, which could resolve differently depending on the current working directory when the function runs. I'm wondering if Netlify dev is reloading the functions when the test data file gets created, which could explain why AUTH-FP-02 works but AUTH-E2E-01 doesn't—they're hitting different states of the function compilation. Let me trace through the AUTH-FP-02 test to see what's actually different.\n\nSetting up a fresh browser context and navigating to the forgot password page, then filling in the email field and submitting the form to trigger the API call...\n\nThe handler queries the database for the user, and since `test@example.com` likely doesn't exist in the test database, it returns the success message without actually sending an email—but the fact that it calls `sql` confirms `getDb()` is working. Looking at the test timeline, AUTH-FP-02 ran from 18:40:38.350 to 18:40:43.669 and passed, while AUTH-E2E-01 started at 18:40:38.362, so they were running concurrently.\n\nThe signup POST in AUTH-E2E-01 would happen several seconds after the test starts, probably around 18:40:42, which is before AUTH-FP-02 finished—so both tests were hitting the same auth function at overlapping times. I'm stuck in a loop trying to figure out what's happening without seeing the actual server output from the Netlify dev server during the test run. Let me shift focus and look at the Sidebar code to trace through the signup flow.\n\nWhen the signup result contains an error, the Sidebar sets the error message and keeps the form visible instead of hiding it. The test then waits for the user name element to appear, but it never does because the error is displayed instead. I should either add retry logic to the signup call in the test or investigate whether the Netlify dev server is properly handling the concurrent function calls across all 9 tests running with 8 parallel workers.\n\nA simpler fix might be adding retries to the E2E test, but that's just masking the real problem. Instead, I should increase the webServer timeout in the Playwright config to give Netlify dev more time to start, and reduce the worker count to avoid overwhelming the dev server. Let me also check if there's a race condition with how environment variables are being injected—the webServer unsets DATABASE_URL, but Netlify dev might be re-injecting it from the `.env` file after the function module loads, causing the function to see both IS_TEST and DATABASE_URL simultaneously.\n\nActually, the env vars are set in the process and read at request time, not at module load time, so that's probably not it. The most practical approach is to make the test itself more resilient—either by adding a retry on the signup call in the AuthProvider, or by handling the error in the test and retrying the form submission. Let me start with the simplest fix: checking if the signup request is being sent before the dev server is fully ready. The test does `page.goto('/clients')` with `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`, but the dev server might load functions lazily, so I could add a small delay before signup or warm up the auth function first.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the test creates a new context with empty storageState, so no auth token is included in the fetch interceptor—though that's fine since signup doesn't require auth. The real issue might be that the Netlify dev server doesn't always propagate the `IS_TEST=true` environment variable to the function process, even though it should be available from the command. But wait, other functions work and they use `IS_TEST` to read test data, so that's not it either. The most likely culprit is that the Netlify dev server sometimes needs a moment to fully initialize before handling requests.\n\nI should add retry logic to the signup call, but the test failed both times, so it's not purely intermittent. Let me check if this is specific to the auth function or if other functions like clients have the same issue—and since the clients function works fine with `getDb()`, each function must have its own bundled dependencies.\n\nRather than keep debugging the Netlify dev server behavior, I'll modify the E2E test to retry the signup if it

The `email_confirmed` column is defined in `initSchema` (schema.ts) which creates the table with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. But if the users table already existed from a previous deployment/migration that didn't have the `email_confirmed` column, then `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` would not add the new column.\n\nThe migrations file (`migrate-db.ts`) adds `password_hash` but does NOT add `email_confirmed`! So if the test is using a Neon branch created from the main branch (which already has the users table without `email_confirmed`), the column won't exist.\n\nThis is the bug! The `initSchema` creates the table with `email_confirmed` IF the table doesn't exist yet. \n\nBut since the table was already created in a previous deployment without this column, `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` skips the creation entirely. And the migration file doesn't add `email_confirmed`. The fix is to add an ALTER TABLE statement to the migrations file that adds the missing column if it doesn't exist, and also ensure the `email_tokens` table gets created there too.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider—the test creates a fresh Neon branch from the main branch, so it should have whatever schema is currently deployed. If the deployed version doesn't have `email_confirmed`, then the test branch won't either.\n\nThe real issue is that `initSchema` only creates the table if it doesn't exist, but since the branched data already has the table, it won't modify it. So I need to add proper migrations for both the `email_confirmed` column and the `email_tokens` table.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":469,"cache_read_input_tokens":161670,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":469,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1","uuid":"2a0b72b9-6ef6-45db-a84c-1d6825f9d33c"}

[2026-02-20T18:48:50.622Z] {"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: The user asked me to read the strategy file `strategies/jobs/maintain/fixBugReport.md` and complete 4 jobs:\n   - FixBug: Add email confirmation for signups and forgot password with Resend API\n   - UpdateTests: Update tests for email confirmation and forgot password\n   - UpdateRevisions: Record spec changes for auth improvements\n   - ResolveBug: Mark auth improvements bug as resolved\n\n2. **Strategy Reading**: I read the fixBugReport.md strategy which outlines how to handle bug fixes: analyze, fix, update tests, update revisions, resolve.\n\n3. **Discovery Phase**: I explored the codebase extensively:\n   - Read AGENTS.md for project structure\n   - Read bugReports.md - found the open bug about auth improvements\n   - Read AppRevisions.md - existing auth documentation\n   - Read existing auth backend (netlify/functions/auth.ts) - custom JWT auth with signup/login\n   - Read frontend auth (src/lib/auth.ts, AuthProvider.tsx, Sidebar.tsx)\n   - Read schema.ts - already had email_confirmed column and email_tokens table\n   - Read netlify/utils/email.ts - already had Resend email sending functions\n   - Read App.tsx - routing, no auth routes yet\n   - Read existing tests (tests/auth.spec.ts)\n   - Read writeApp.md strategy for guidelines\n\n4. **Key Finding**: The database schema already had `email_confirmed` and `email_tokens` tables, and email utility functions existed. The main work was:\n   - Backend: Update auth.ts to require email confirmation (with test mode bypass), add confirm-email, forgot-password, reset-password endpoints\n   - Frontend: Update AuthProvider, Sidebar (add forgot password link), create 3 new pages\n   - Routes: Add /auth/confirm-email, /auth/reset-password, /auth/forgot-password\n\n5. **Implementation - FixBug Job**:\n   - Updated `netlify/functions/auth.ts` - Added confirm-email, forgot-password, reset-password POST handlers; modified signup to send confirmation email (auto-confirm in IS_TEST mode); modified login to check email_confirmed\n   - Updated `src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx` - Added forgotPassword, resetPassword, confirmEmail functions; modified signUp to handle needsConfirmation response\n   - Updated `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Added \"Forgot password?\" link, confirmation message display, useNavigate for forgot-password page\n   - Created `src/pages/ConfirmEmailPage.tsx` - Handles /auth/confirm-email?token=...\n   - Created `src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - Handles /auth/reset-password?token=...\n   - Created `src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` - Handles /auth/forgot-password\n   - Updated `src/App.tsx` - Added 3 new auth routes\n\n6. **Implementation - UpdateTests Job**:\n   - Updated `docs/tests.md` - Added test entries for AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01; updated AUTH-USR-02 to mention forgot password link\n   - Updated `tests/auth.spec.ts` - Added 5 new test cases + updated AUTH-USR-02 to check for auth-forgot-password element\n\n7. **Testing Issues**:\n   - **Issue 1: 0 tests found** - The `projects` section in playwright.config.ts used `devices['Desktop Chrome']` which required Chrome (not installed). The Replay Chromium was installed but the project overrode the global `use` settings. Fixed by removing the `projects` array entirely.\n   - **Issue 2: base.ts syntax error** - `test.beforeEach(async (_fixtures, testInfo) => {` - Playwright requires object destructuring for first argument. Fixed with `async ({}, testInfo) =>` and eslint-disable comments.\n   - **Issue 3: Unused import** - Removed `devices` import from playwright.config.ts after removing projects section.\n   - **Issue 4: AUTH-E2E-01 failing with 500** - The signup API returned 500. Investigated using Replay MCP tools. Found the error was `IS_TEST is set but tests/test-branch-data.json not found`. \n   - **Root Cause Discovery**: The REAL root cause was that `email_confirmed` column didn't exist in the test database. The column was in `initSchema` (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS) but the users table already existed from a previous deployment WITHOUT this column. The migration file (`migrate-db.ts`) didn't include the ALTER TABLE for `email_confirmed` or the CREATE TABLE for `email_tokens`.\n   - **Fix**: Added `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS email_tokens` to `migrate-db.ts`.\n\n8. **Also made AuthProvider more robust**: Changed `res.json()` to `res.text()` + `JSON.parse()` with try/catch to handle non-JSON error responses from the server.\n\n9. **Current State**: The migration fix was just applied. Tests need to be re-run. Jobs 3 (UpdateRevisions) and 4 (ResolveBug) are still pending.\n\nLet me also track all the files that were modified:\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/auth.ts` - Major rewrite with new endpoints\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx` - Added new auth methods\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Added forgot password link\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ConfirmEmailPage.tsx` - NEW\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - NEW\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` - NEW\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` - Added 3 new routes\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` - Added new test entries\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/auth.spec.ts` - Added 5 new tests\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/base.ts` - Fixed syntax for Playwright compatibility\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/playwright.config.ts` - Removed broken projects section\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/migrate-db.ts` - Added email_confirmed column and email_tokens table migrations\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user asked me to follow the strategy in `strategies/jobs/maintain/fixBugReport.md` and complete 4 jobs sequentially:\n   - **FixBug**: Add email confirmation for signups and forgot password with Resend API\n   - **UpdateTests**: Update tests for email confirmation and forgot password\n   - **UpdateRevisions**: Record spec changes for auth improvements\n   - **ResolveBug**: Mark auth improvements bug as resolved\n   \n   The bug is from `docs/bugReports.md`: \"Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a 'Forgot password' link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\"\n\n   When all jobs complete, output `<DONE>`.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Neon Postgres database with `@neondatabase/serverless` tagged template literals\n   - Netlify Functions for backend API\n   - React 18 SPA with React Router, Redux, and context-based auth\n   - JWT authentication with `jose` library (HS256)\n   - Password hashing with `scryptSync`\n   - Resend API for transactional emails (already installed as dependency v6.9.2)\n   - Email tokens table for confirm/reset flows with expiry\n   - `IS_TEST` environment variable to auto-confirm users in test mode\n   - Playwright E2E tests with Replay Chromium browser\n   - Database migrations via `migrate-db.ts` (ALTER TABLE for existing tables)\n   - `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` won't add new columns to existing tables — migrations needed\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/auth.ts`** (MODIFIED - core backend changes)\n     - Added `import { sendConfirmationEmail, sendPasswordResetEmail } from '../utils/email'`\n     - Added `generateEmailToken()` function using `randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`\n     - Added `POST ?action=confirm-email` endpoint: validates token from email_tokens table, marks user confirmed, returns JWT session\n     - Added `POST ?action=forgot-password` endpoint: creates reset token, sends email via Resend, always returns success (prevents email enumeration)\n     - Added `POST ?action=reset-password` endpoint: validates reset token, updates password hash, returns JWT session\n     - Modified `POST ?action=signup`: In test mode (`IS_TEST=true`), auto-confirms user and returns session immediately. In production, creates unconfirmed user, generates confirm token (24h expiry), sends confirmation email, returns `{ needsConfirmation: true, message: '...' }`\n     - Modified `POST ?action=login`: Added `email_confirmed` check — in production, returns 403 if not confirmed\n     - Moved `const sql = getDb()` before action handlers (line ~81)\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Added `forgotPassword`, `resetPassword`, `confirmEmail` methods to context\n     - Modified `signUp` to handle `needsConfirmation` response and return it in AuthResult\n     - Changed `res.json()` to `res.text()` + `JSON.parse()` with try/catch for robustness against non-JSON 500 errors\n     - AuthResult interface now includes `needsConfirmation?: boolean` and `message?: string`\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Added `useNavigate` import and `navigate` hook\n     - Added `confirmationMessage` state\n     - Added \"Forgot password?\" link (`data-testid=\"auth-forgot-password\"`) in sign-in mode that navigates to `/auth/forgot-password`\n     - Added confirmation message display (`data-testid=\"auth-confirmation-message\"`) after successful signup in production mode\n     - Modified `handleSubmit` to handle `result.needsConfirmation`\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ConfirmEmailPage.tsx`** (NEW)\n     - Route: `/auth/confirm-email?token=...`\n     - States: loading, success, error\n     - On mount, calls `confirmEmail(token)` from AuthProvider\n     - On success, auto-redirects to `/clients` after 2 seconds\n     - Key test IDs: `confirm-email-page`, `confirm-email-loading`, `confirm-email-success`, `confirm-email-error`\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx`** (NEW)\n     - Route: `/auth/reset-password?token=...`\n     - Form with new password + confirm password fields\n     - Validates password length and match\n     - Calls `resetPassword(token, password)` from AuthProvider\n     - Key test IDs: `reset-password-page`, `reset-password-form`, `reset-password-input`, `reset-password-confirm-input`, `reset-password-submit`, `reset-password-error`, `reset-password-success`\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`** (NEW)\n     - Route: `/auth/forgot-password`\n     - Form with email input\n     - Calls `forgotPassword(email)` from AuthProvider\n     - Shows success message after submission\n     - Key test IDs: `forgot-password-page`, `forgot-password-form`, `forgot-password-email`, `forgot-password-submit`, `forgot-password-success`, `forgot-password-back`, `forgot-password-back-to-signin`\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Added imports for ConfirmEmailPage, ResetPasswordPage, ForgotPasswordPage\n     - Added 3 routes inside AppLayout: `/auth/confirm-email`, `/auth/reset-password`, `/auth/forgot-password`\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`** (MODIFIED - Section 0. Authentication)\n     - Updated Components section to describe ForgotPasswordPage, ResetPasswordPage, ConfirmEmailPage\n     - Updated AUTH-USR-02 to mention `auth-forgot-password` test ID\n     - Added AUTH-FP-01, AUTH-FP-02, AUTH-RP-01, AUTH-RP-02, AUTH-CE-01 test entries\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/auth.spec.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Updated AUTH-USR-02 to check for `auth-forgot-password` visibility\n     - Added `ForgotPasswordPage` describe block with AUTH-FP-01 and AUTH-FP-02\n     - Added `ResetPasswordPage` describe block with AUTH-RP-01 and AUTH-RP-02\n     - Added `ConfirmEmailPage` describe block with AUTH-CE-01\n     - All new tests use `browser.newContext({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } })` for unauthenticated state\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/base.ts`** (MODIFIED - fixed Playwright compatibility)\n     - Changed `async (_fixtures, testInfo)` to `async ({}, testInfo)` with `// eslint-disable-next-line no-empty-pattern`\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/playwright.config.ts`** (MODIFIED)\n     - Removed `devices` import (unused after removing projects)\n     - Removed entire `projects` array that was using `devices['Desktop Chrome']` (required Chrome which wasn't installed)\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/migrate-db.ts`** (MODIFIED - critical fix)\n     - Added: `await sql\\`ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false\\``\n     - Added: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS email_tokens` with full schema\n     - This was the ROOT CAUSE of AUTH-E2E-01 test failure — the column didn't exist in branched test databases\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/utils/email.ts`** (READ ONLY - already existed)\n     - Has `sendConfirmationEmail(email, token)` and `sendPasswordResetEmail(email, token)`\n     - Uses Resend API with fallback to console.log when RESEND_API_KEY not set\n\n   - **`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/scripts/schema.ts`** (READ ONLY)\n     - Already has `email_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` in users table\n     - Already has `email_tokens` table definition\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **0 tests found (totalTests: 0)**:\n     - Cause 1: `playwright.config.ts` had a `projects` section using `devices['Desktop Chrome']` which requires Chrome browser (not installed). This overrode the global `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` settings.\n     - Fix: Removed the `projects` array entirely, relying on global `use` config.\n     - Cause 2 (revealed after fixing Cause 1): `tests/base.ts` had `async (_fixtures, testInfo)` which Playwright rejects — requires object destructuring pattern for first argument.\n     - Fix: Changed to `async ({}, testInfo)` with eslint-disable comment.\n   \n   - **eslint `no-empty-pattern` errors on `{}`**:\n     - First tried `{ /* fixtures */ }` — still matched as empty pattern\n     - Then tried extracting to helper functions with `_fixtures` param — Playwright rejected non-destructured first arg\n     - Final fix: `// eslint-disable-next-line no-empty-pattern` before each hook\n\n   - **AUTH-E2E-01 test failing with 500 from signup API**:\n     - Investigated via Replay MCP: `res.status` was 500, response body was non-JSON HTML error page\n     - Manual curl confirmed error: `IS_TEST is set but tests/test-branch-data.json not found`\n     - Initially thought it was a transient Netlify dev server issue — added retry logic\n     - Retry also failed (both attempts got 500), proving it was NOT transient\n     - **Root cause**: The `email_confirmed` column and `email_tokens` table were defined in `initSchema` using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, but the users table already existed in the Neon branch (created from main branch) WITHOUT these columns. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` skips creation entirely if table exists. The `migrate-db.ts` file had migrations for `password_hash` but NOT for `email_confirmed` or `email_tokens`.\n     - Fix: Added `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS email_tokens` to `migrate-db.ts`\n     - Also made AuthProvider more robust: changed `res.json()` to `res.text()` + `JSON.parse()` try/catch to handle non-JSON error responses\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Solved**: FixBug job — full implementation of email confirmation and forgot password\n   - **Solved**: Test spec updates in docs/tests.md \n   - **Solved**: New Playwright tests for all new functionality (5 new tests)\n   - **Solved**: Playwright config broken projects section\n   - **Solved**: base.ts Playwright compatibility issue\n   - **Solved (pending verification)**: Root cause of AUTH-E2E-01 failure via missing database migration\n   - **In Progress**: Need to re-run tests to verify the migration fix resolves AUTH-E2E-01\n   - **Pending**: UpdateRevisions (job 3) and ResolveBug (job 4)\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - Message 1: \"Read strategy file: strategies/jobs/maintain/fixBugReport.md. Jobs to complete: 1.

Current Work:\n   I was in the middle of Job 2 (UpdateTests). After writing all new tests and updating the test spec, I ran into persistent AUTH-E2E-01 failures. Through extensive Replay MCP debugging across 3 test runs, I identified the root cause as a missing database migration. I just applied the fix to `scripts/migrate-db.ts`:\n   ```typescript\n   await sql`ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false`\n   // ... and CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS email_tokens\n   ```\n   I also cleaned up the retry logic from the E2E test (reverting to simpler form), ran `npm run check` (passed), and was about to re-run the auth tests.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Re-run the auth tests to verify the migration fix:\n   ```\n   export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975 && npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts\n   ```\n   If all 9 tests pass, move on to Job 3 (UpdateRevisions) — update `AppRevisions.md` with the new email confirmation and forgot password functionality, then Job 4 (ResolveBug) — move the bug report to \"Unreviewed\" section. The last commands run were `npm run check` (passed) after applying the migration fix, and the test needs to be re-executed.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /repo/.agent-home/.claude/projects/-repo/feee88ba-b0b2-4e78-b497-36bd10df3ff1.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions.

Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Two sections:\n1. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n2. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":26,"oldLines":8,"newStart":26,"newLines":14,"lines":[" "," ## Authentication"," ","-Authentication is optional.

Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button).

DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n    17→- Problem stage: writeApp.md — the DealDetailHeader component implemented editing for name, value, and owner fields but omitted client_id editing, violating the DDP-HDR-02 spec requirement\n    18→\n    19→2/19/2026: WebhookDialogInstructions — The \"Add Webhook\" dialog needs actual setup instructions for each supported platform.\n    20→- Before: 25bd361\n    21→- After: 7af02ba\n    22→- Fix: Added platform-specific setup guide to the WebhookModal with Zapier, n8n, and Custom Endpoint tabs.

Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal.

Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item.

Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n    43→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n    44→\n    45→2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n    46→- Before: cc0d9ad\n    47→- After: (this commit)\n    48→- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    49→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n    50→- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n    51→\n    52→2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n    53→- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n    54→- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n    55→- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n    56→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n    57→\n    58→2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n    59→- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n    60→\n    61→2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n    62→- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n    63→\n    64→2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n    65→- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n    66→\n    67→2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n    68→- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n    69→- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n    70→- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n    71→- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n    72→\n    73→2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n    74→- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n    75→- Before: df7222c\n    76→- After: c0847d0\n    77→- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    78→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n    79→\n    80→2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n    81→- Before: ef67c9a\n    82→- After: (this commit)\n    83→- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n    84→- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n    85→- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n    86→\n    87→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n    88→- Before: 4e63501\n    89→- After: (this commit)\n    90→- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n    91→- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n    92→\n    93→2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n    94→- Before: fbafcda\n    95→- After: (this commit)\n    96→- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n    97→- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n    98→- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n    99→\n   100→\n   101→\n   102→2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n   103→- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n   104→- Before: fc47dd2\n   105→- After: 8b82e35\n   106→- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n   107→- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n   108→\n   109→2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n   110→- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n   111→- Before: 78daa0a\n   112→- After: fc47dd2\n   113→- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation.

Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button). Notifications should cover any changes affecting the client, including changes to the client's contacts or deals. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n\n2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system. This should be a dedicated page accessible from the sidebar that lists all contacts with search functionality.\n\n2/20/2026: Improve the auth system: require email confirmation for new user signups before they can log in, and add a \"Forgot password\" link on the login page that sends a password reset email. Use the Resend API for sending emails.\n\n## Unreviewed\n\n2/20/2026: DDP-HDR-02 violation — Client field in DealDetailHeader was not editable\n- Before: edc5279\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added searchable client dropdown to DealDetailHeader edit mode using FilterSelect. DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — the DealDetailHeader component implemented editing for name, value, and owner fields but omitted client_id editing, violating the DDP-HDR-02 spec requirement\n\n2/19/2026: WebhookDialogInstructions — The \"Add Webhook\" dialog needs actual setup instructions for each supported platform.\n- Before: 25bd361\n- After: 7af02ba\n- Fix: Added platform-specific setup guide to the WebhookModal with Zapier, n8n, and Custom Endpoint tabs. Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n\n## Finished\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n- Before: 0cd095c\n- After: 78daa0a\n- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior.

Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n","numLines":148,"startLine":1,"totalLines":148}}}

Logged-in users should be able to go to the Settings page and configure their email notification preferences for when changes happen to a client they are following. \"Following\" a client means the user has opted in on that client's detail page (add a follow/unfollow button).

DealDetailPage now fetches available clients and passes them as prop. Backend deals PUT endpoint now includes client_id in the UPDATE query. Updated DDP-HDR-02 test to verify client field editing per spec (select different client, save, verify persistence). All 29 deal-detail-page tests pass.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — the DealDetailHeader component implemented editing for name, value, and owner fields but omitted client_id editing, violating the DDP-HDR-02 spec requirement\n\n2/19/2026: WebhookDialogInstructions — The \"Add Webhook\" dialog needs actual setup instructions for each supported platform.\n- Before: 25bd361\n- After: 7af02ba\n- Fix: Added platform-specific setup guide to the WebhookModal with Zapier, n8n, and Custom Endpoint tabs. Each platform shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and a platform-specific tip. Added a toggleable payload format section showing the JSON event structure. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform. Added 2 new tests (STP-WH-04 for setup guide navigation, STP-WH-05 for payload format toggle) and updated STP-WH-02 to verify setup guide presence. Renumbered old STP-WH-04 (delete) to STP-WH-06.\n- Problem stage: none (enhancement to existing feature — setup guides were not part of the original webhook spec)\n\n## Finished\n\n2/18/2026: There should be a users page where you can see everyone that has an account, and a user detail page where you can see their activity and what they are managing. Everywhere in the app that refers to users with accounts should allow selecting them from a dropdown (e.g., deal owner, task assignee).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) with user card grid showing avatar, name, email, active deals, and open tasks. Added User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId) with user info, summary stats, owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity. Created /.netlify/functions/users API (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members matching existing owner/assignee names. Added \"Team\" sidebar nav item. Replaced free-form text inputs for deal owner and task assignee with FilterSelect dropdowns populated from users API in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. Added 6 Playwright tests (ULP-HDR-01/02, UDP-HDR-01/02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — users/team management was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Add a settings page and move the import/export buttons there. The settings page should also have webhook settings where you can configure webhooks to send to Zapier / n8n / Discord on different events selected from a list (e.g., new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc.).\n- Before: 1e5a771\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Import & Export section has buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV (reusing shared ImportDialog). Webhooks section has full CRUD — add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes (10 events: client_created, client_updated, deal_created, deal_stage_changed, deal_closed_won, deal_closed_lost, task_created, task_completed, contact_created, note_added); enable/disable toggle; delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and /.netlify/functions/webhooks API endpoint. Sidebar now includes Settings nav item. Added 7 new Playwright tests (STP-HDR-01, STP-IE-01/02, STP-WH-01/02/03/04) and updated CLP-NAV-01/02.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — settings page with webhooks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: Import from CSV needs to support importing deals, contacts, and tasks as well — not just clients.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV import support for deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Deals page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /deals?action=import) supporting Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status columns with client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with bulk import endpoint (POST /tasks?action=import) supporting Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee columns. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with bulk import endpoint (POST /individuals?action=import) supporting Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name columns that creates individuals and optionally associates with clients. Extracted shared ImportDialog component for reuse. Added 6 new Playwright tests (DLP-HDR-04/05, TLP-HDR-04/05, CLP-HDR-07/08).\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — CSV import for deals/contacts/tasks was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import functionality should specify the required format. The import from CSV button doesn't tell the user what columns or format the CSV file needs to be in.\n- Before: cc0d9ad\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added CSV column format specification table to import dialog showing all 9 supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Added \"Download CSV template\" button. Implemented CSV parsing with proper quote handling, header mapping, and per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the test spec for the import dialog (CLP-HDR-04) only required \"an import dialog/modal opens allowing the user to upload client data\" without specifying that the dialog should show the expected CSV format or required columns\n- Directive: Added directive to testSpec.md: import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, and test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user\n\n2/17/2026: Sign-in flow doesn't work — after signing up with email/password, attempting to sign in returns \"invalid login credentials\".\n- The shared Supabase auth server at `auth.nut.new` has email confirmation enabled. When `auth.signUp()` is called, it creates the user but does not return a session (because the email is unverified). The user then tries to sign in with `auth.signInWithPassword()`, which fails because the account is unconfirmed.\n- Fix: Ripped out the entire Supabase dependency. Built custom auth backend (`netlify/functions/auth.ts`) with signup, login, and session endpoints using scrypt password hashing and HS256 JWT tokens. Signup immediately returns a session — no email confirmation required. Rewrote frontend `src/lib/auth.ts` (simple token management + fetch interceptor), `AuthProvider.tsx` (calls custom backend), `authSlice.ts` (removed Supabase). Removed `@supabase/supabase-js` package, Supabase env vars, dead Login/Register/AuthCallback pages. Updated backend `netlify/utils/auth.ts` to verify HS256 JWTs. Added AUTH-E2E-01 test that exercises full signup → sign-out → sign-in flow. Bundle size reduced from 1308KB to 881KB.\n- Problem stage: build/writeApp.md — used an external auth provider (Supabase) whose email confirmation behavior couldn't be controlled, causing signup to silently fail to establish a session\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: apps with login/signup must have a complete e2e test exercising the full sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend\n\n2/17/2026: Rip out Google OAuth and replace with email/password login.\n- Superseded by the fix above — the entire Supabase dependency has been removed and replaced with a custom auth backend.\n\n2/17/2026: App doesn't work after deployment — clients page doesn't load or display any data.\n- Investigation: API endpoint returns 200 with data. Frontend loads. Issue was transient. Deployment test (Replay recording 15504b44-6cef-49d2-8768-c0d013d0c924) confirms everything works.\n\n2/17/2026: Login flow doesn't work — clicking \"Sign in with Google\" opens the OAuth popup and the Google sign-in flow completes, but after returning the user is still not logged in with no apparent errors.\n- Superseded by the Supabase removal above. The entire OAuth flow has been removed.\n\n2/17/2026: Can't login to the app — the SSO popup opens in the same window as the app instead of a new window, breaking the login flow. Authentication should be optional — the app should load and be usable without logging in, with database access not requiring auth. There should be a current user info area in the upper left that shows the logged-in user and allows for logging in.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SSOAuthOptional.md\n- Fix: Made authentication optional. Removed Login/Register pages and RequireAuth guard. SSO now opens in a popup window. Backend uses optionalAuth middleware (allows unauthenticated requests, user falls back to \"System\"). Sidebar user area moved to upper left with avatar/name/sign-out when logged in, or \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — the old test spec specified that the login page has a \"Google OAuth button\" but did not specify the click behavior (should open in popup window, not navigate the current window)\n- Directive: Updated testSpec.md directive: clickable elements that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.) must specify how the flow opens and what happens on completion\n\n2/16/2026: The app has no authentication — all pages and API endpoints are accessible without logging in and there is no user identity.\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AuthenticationSystem.md\n- Before: df7222c\n- After: c0847d0\n- Fix: Added Supabase authentication system with Login/Register/AuthCallback pages, RequireAuth route guard, JWT verification middleware (requiresAuth wrapper) on all 10 Netlify Functions, fetch interceptor for automatic token injection, AuthProvider context, user info in sidebar, and IS_TEST mode for Playwright. Timeline events and deal history now use authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — authentication was not part of the original spec)\n\n2/16/2026: Links to tasks don't work. They either go to the wrong page, aren't clickable, or go to a \"task not found\" page.\n- Before: ef67c9a\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Client detail TasksSection now navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was /deals/:dealId or not clickable). Deal detail LinkedTasksSection now also navigates to /tasks/:taskId (was not clickable at all).\n- Problem stage: none (change in app requirements — the old spec specified navigation to deal detail page, but the TaskDetailPage added in a previous maintenance round changed the expected target)\n- Note: Added missing AppRevisions.md entry for task link navigation change.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page should allow drag-and-drop to move deals between stages.\n- Before: 4e63501\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Added HTML5 drag-and-drop support to DealsPipelineView. Deal cards are draggable and can be dropped on different stage columns to change the deal's stage via the API.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality — the original spec described the pipeline view as display-only with no drag-and-drop)\n\n2/16/2026: Attachment functionality on the deals page does not allow file uploads.\n- Before: fbafcda\n- After: (this commit)\n- Fix: Updated UploadAttachmentModal on deal detail page to support both file upload and link URL modes via toggle buttons, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n- Problem stage: writeTests.md — test spec entries (DDP-ATT-02, DDP-ATT-03) specified \"file picker/upload dialog\" and \"select and upload a file\", but the Playwright tests only verified a URL input form instead of actual file upload mechanics, masking the missing upload functionality\n- Directive: Added directive to writeTests.md: when the test spec describes file upload functionality, the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics, not substitute URL/text input tests\n\n\n\n2/14/2026: Add a task detail page that has all pertinent information and can be used to mark the task completed or canceled, or add notes\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/TaskDetailPage.md\n- Before: fc47dd2\n- After: 8b82e35\n- Fix: Added TaskDetailPage with header (title, priority, status, back/complete/cancel), notes section (add/delete/empty state), and 7 new Playwright tests. Added task_notes table, GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Task cards now navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n- Problem stage: none (new functionality)\n\n2/14/2026: When on the clients page both the \"dashboard\" and \"clients\" are highlighted. no point having duplicates, just remove the dashboard here\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DashboardHighlight.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Dashboard\" entry from sidebar navigation. Both linked to /clients.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — duplicate navigation links pointing to the same URL\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL\n\n2/14/2026: \"Reports\" link on left goes to a 404. all links must go to valid locations\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/Reports404.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Reports\" link from sidebar. No /reports route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Reports as a nav link but no test entry covered its navigation target\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: \"Settings\" button in lower left does not do anything. all enabled buttons must do something\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/SettingsButton.md\n- Before: 78daa0a\n- After: fc47dd2\n- Fix: Removed \"Settings\" button from sidebar. No /settings route exists.\n- Problem stage: testSpec.md — spec listed Settings as a nav link but no test entry covered its click behavior\n- Directive: Existing directive already covers this: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\n2/14/2026: On deals page the dropdowns look good but when clicked they revert to the browser's default styling which is ugly. when clicked they should be styled appropriately\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/DealsDropdownStyling.md\n- Before: 0cd095c\n- After: 78daa0a\n- Fix: Replaced native `<select>` elements in DealsFilterControls with custom dropdown component using React state, styled menu, and click-outside-to-close behavior. Updated all DLP-FLT tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used native HTML `<select>` elements instead of custom styled dropdowns\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: never use native `<select>` elements when the app has a custom design system\n\n2/14/2026: Attachments on clients page should show a preview with the file type and thumbnail for images. all attachment displays should look this way\n- Analysis: docs/bugs/AttachmentPreview.md\n- Before: 0301f38\n- After: 0cd095c\n- Fix: Added AttachmentPreview component with file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, etc.) and image thumbnails. Updated both client and deal attachment displays. Updated test spec and tests.\n- Problem stage: writeApp.md — used generic file icon for all attachment types\n- Directive: Added directive to writeApp.md: attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":6,"oldLines":10,"newStart":6,"newLines":14,"lines":[" "," 2/20/2026: Add a Contacts page for searching all people/individuals that have been added to the system.
