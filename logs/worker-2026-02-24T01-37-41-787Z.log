Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test.

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b7beca64-2e87-46b1-8435-1c6fef5e14c6","uuid":"dd9f00f9-0670-4d3b-89a8-6141e39ef1e9","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

Let me go through each job systematically.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecConfirmEmail - Check testSpec.md directive violations in ConfirmEmailPage test entries\n\nI need to look at what's in docs/tests.md for the ConfirmEmailPage section. Looking at line 1049:\n\n```\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n```\n\nAnd that's it! There's only a section header for ConfirmEmailPage with NO test entries. The file just ends there (line 1050 is the last line).\n\nNow let me check the testSpec.md directives:\n\n\nThe ConfirmEmailPage section is completely empty—there are no test entries at all, which violates multiple directives: test entries must have titles, every interactive element needs testing (including the success redirect to /clients and error message display), and there's no inventory of visible elements or clickable targets documented. is a clear violation - the ConfirmEmailPage section has NO test entries. Based on the component's behavior, I need to define what tests should exist: confirming the loading state appears with a valid token, verifying the success message and redirect to /clients after confirmation, handling missing tokens with an error, dealing with invalid or expired tokens, managing network failures, and ensuring any returned auth token gets stored properly.\n\nNow I'm checking the component against the writeApp.md directives - it has the necessary test IDs for success and error states, includes the required padding classes on the root element, and meets the layout requirements. However, the component doesn't abstract its JSX into separate child components, though given its simplicity this might be acceptable depending on how strictly the abstraction rule is enforced.\n\nThe main issue I'm seeing is that the loading state text lacks a data-testid attribute, which violates the requirement that all interactive elements and containers need test IDs. For the backend, the confirm-email action appears incomplete as it doesn't return a value.\n\nLooking at the component, it expects a JWT token for auto-login after email confirmation, but the backend only returns a success message without the token. The AppRevisions spec says the action should \"confirm the account and log them in,\" so the backend needs to return that token. Let me check the actual backend handler to see what's happening...\n\nExamining the backend code...\n\nThe backend marks the token as used but doesn't generate or return a JWT, which contradicts what the frontend expects and what the spec requires. This is a real bug—the backend should create and return a JWT token after confirming the email. Now let me focus on checking for directive violations rather than general bugs. Looking at the writeApp.md directives, I need to verify the data-testid attributes are properly placed on interactive elements.\n\nThe loading state is missing a testid, which violates the directive that requires testids on anything E2E tests need to target. The directive also says to check test entries in the spec against the app code, but since there are no test entries defined, I can't fully validate that requirement.\n\nLooking at the backend's confirm-email flow, it marks the token as used but doesn't generate a session JWT, so the frontend won't receive the expected token and the user won't be logged in after confirmation—this breaks the end-to-end functionality described in AppRevisions where confirming the account should log them in.\n\nFor the tests directive check, there's no confirm-email.spec.ts file in the test suite, and since there are no test entries in docs/tests.md for this feature either, I need to determine what the writeTests.md directive actually requires.\n\nThe writeTests.md directive is clear: any auth flow involving email-based verification must have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path without relying on test bypasses. The confirm-email flow is missing these tests entirely, which is a direct violation.\n\nNow I'm compiling my findings across all three jobs to identify the violation groups and what needs to be fixed. file exists. Now I'm organizing these violations into fix groups so I can address them systematically. I'll create three groups: one for documenting the missing test entries, another for fixing the component and backend issues, and a third for writing the actual tests. Looking at the recent commit pattern, each fix group focuses on a single violation area with its own test and documentation steps. So I should create three separate groups: one for the test spec entries, one for the component and backend issues, and one for the actual Playwright tests.\n\nSince these need to execute in order—test entries first, then component fixes, then tests—I'll add them in reverse so they queue up correctly. pushes tests back)\n\nSo the execution order will be: test spec → component fix → tests, which is what I need.\n\nI could use --trailing to add them to the end instead, but reverse order works fine. Each group should be independently fixable anyway, though the test spec needs to come first so the other groups can reference it.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the \"backend not returning JWT\" issue actually violates the writeApp.md directive. The directive says to identify test entries in the spec relevant to a component and satisfy them in the app code, but there are no test entries for ConfirmEmailPage, so I can't really validate this against the spec.\n\nHowever, there's also the guideline about writing clean, working code with no TODOs or placeholder implementations—everything must be real and fully functional end-to-end. The AppRevisions specify that the feature \"confirms the account and logs them in,\" but the code isn't implementing this correctly, so I should treat this as a component fix violation.\n\nI'll group the component issues together since they're both about making ConfirmEmailPage work: add the missing testid and fix the backend to return the JWT. Then I'll organize the fixes into three groups: test spec entries for ConfirmEmailPage, the component and backend fixes, and finally the Playwright tests.\n\nLooking at the writeTests.md directives, I'm noticing the main violation is that no tests exist at all for the auth flows involving email verification, which directly violates the requirement for dedicated tests exercising the real production code path. Since I can't verify the other directive compliance without tests existing, the core issue for Job 3 is simply the absence of any

Let me systematically work through each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecConfirmEmail\n\nChecking `docs/tests.md` for ConfirmEmailPage test entries against `testSpec.md` directives.\n\nThe ConfirmEmailPage section starts at line 1049:\n```\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n```\n\nAnd that's the **last line of the file** — the section is completely **empty**. There are zero test entries.\n\nLooking at what the ConfirmEmailPage component actually does:\n- Shows \"Confirming your email...\" loading state when token is present\n- Shows \"Email confirmed! Redirecting...\" on success, then navigates to /clients\n- Shows \"No confirmation token provided\" when token is missing\n- Shows error from API (e.g., \"Invalid or expired token\") on failure\n- Shows \"Network error\" on fetch failure\n- Stores JWT token in localStorage if returned by backend\n\n**VIOLATION: Missing all test entries for ConfirmEmailPage.** The testSpec.md directives require:\n- Systematically inventory every visible element\n- Write a test entry for each one\n- For every clickable element / navigation, specify the exact target\n- Test entries must all have titles\n- Test entries grouped by page\n\nThis is a major violation — the entire page is unspecified.\n\n## Job 2: CheckComponentsConfirmEmail\n\nChecking `ConfirmEmailPage.tsx` and the `auth.ts` backend against `writeApp.md` directives.\n\n**Checking: ConfirmEmailPage.tsx**\n\n1. **`data-testid` on interactive elements, containers, and anything E2E tests need to target** — The component has `data-testid=\"confirm-email-page\"`, `data-testid=\"confirm-success\"`, and `data-testid=\"confirm-error\"`. However, the **loading state** `<p>` element (line 51) has **no `data-testid`**. E2E tests need to verify the loading state. **VIOLATION: missing data-testid on loading state element.**\n\n2. **Every page component must include consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)** — The root div has `className=\"p-6 max-sm:p-3 flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen\"`. **OK.**\n\n3. **Write clean, working code. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end** — Per AppRevisions.md: \"confirms the account and logs them in.\" The frontend checks for `data.token` (line 32-34) to store in localStorage. But the **backend confirm-email action** (auth.ts lines 206-233) only returns `{ message: 'Email confirmed successfully.' }` — it does NOT return a JWT token. The auto-login after confirmation is **broken**. **VIOLATION: backend confirm-email doesn't return JWT token for auto-login as specified in AppRevisions.**\n\n4. **All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components** — The page is very simple (just status text). Given other auth pages (ForgotPasswordPage, ResetPasswordPage) follow similar patterns, this is acceptable for the minimal JSX.\n\n5. **Neon tagged template literal syntax** — Backend uses `` sql`...` `` syntax correctly. **OK.**\n\n**Checking: auth.ts confirm-email action (lines 206-233)**\n\n6. **Empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID** — No date/UUID inputs in confirm-email. **OK.**\n\n## Job 3: CheckTestsConfirmEmail\n\nChecking for ConfirmEmailPage test files against `writeTests.md` directives.\n\nTest files in `apps/SalesCRM/tests/`:\n- sidebar-nav.spec.ts\n- deployment.spec.ts\n- sidebar-auth.spec.ts\n- tasks-list.spec.ts\n- contacts-list.spec.ts\n- user-detail.spec.ts\n- forgot-password.spec.ts\n- reset-password.spec.ts\n\n**No confirm-email test file exists.**\n\nThe writeTests.md directive explicitly states:\n> Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass. These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint, query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint with that token and verify success.\n\n**VIOLATION: No dedicated test exists for the confirm-email auth flow.** The password reset has `reset-password.spec.ts` but confirm-email has nothing.\n\n---\n\nNow I'll create fix groups for all the violations found. I need to add them in reverse execution order since `add-group` adds to the front."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":30514,"cache_read_input_tokens":35455,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":30514,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b7beca64-2e87-46b1-8435-1c6fef5e14c6","uuid":"9d7157d1-0a50-4461-a8e4-ddcd317ab14f"}
