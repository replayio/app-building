A common bug is implementing editing\n   100→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   101→\n   102→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   103→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   104→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   105→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   106→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   107→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   108→\n   109→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   110→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   111→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   112→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   113→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   114→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   115→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Tests across\n   124→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   125→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   126→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   127→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   128→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   129→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   130→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   131→  being unmodified.\n   132→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   133→  you need to interact with.\n   134→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   135→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   136→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   137→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   138→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   139→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   140→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   141→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   142→\n   143→## Tips\n   144→\n   145→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   146→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   147→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   148→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   149→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   150→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   151→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   152→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   153→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   154→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"99e80a81-e9e3-4c93-8a46-f50d02fdab7b","uuid":"acb91278-0ba0-448e-bb5e-348d806b31f3","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":154,"startLine":1,"totalLines":154}}}

Displays equipment photo if available\n   - Photo placeholder with icon and \"Click to upload photo\" text\n   - Overlay with \"Change Photo\" button when image exists\n   - Uses file input to upload photos\n   - Converts to base64 and stores in `photo_url` field\n\n2. **Details Card (Editable):**\n   - Model\n   - Serial Number\n   - Location\n   - Manufacturer\n   - Installation Date\n   - Toggle between view and edit modes\n   - Form inputs with validation\n   - Save/Cancel buttons\n\n3. **Description Section (Editable):**\n   - Multi-line description field\n   - Edit button toggles edit mode\n   - Textarea with Save/Cancel buttons\n   - Shows default \"No description provided.\" if empty\n\n**Key Functions:**\n- `handlePhotoUpload()` - File selection and base64 encoding\n- `handleSaveDetails()` - Updates equipment via Redux dispatch\n- `handleCancelDetails()` -

Let me understand the key details:\n\n1. **Seed data equipment:**\n   - Industrial Mixer - Operational, model MX-5000, serial SN-MX-001, location \"Building A, Bay 1\", manufacturer \"MixTech Industries\", installation_date \"2024-03-15\"\n   - Packaging Line - Operational\n   - Conveyor Belt - Operational, model CB-1200, serial SN-CB-001, location \"Building A, Main Floor\", manufacturer \"ConveyAll Corp\", installation_date \"2023-06-10\"\n   - Heat Press - Operational\n   - CNC Router - Maintenance required, model CNC-4500, serial SN-CNC-001, located in Building C Workshop, manufactured by PrecisionCut Inc, installed in September 2022\n   - Quality Scanner - Operational\n\n2. **Equipment with notes:**\n   - CNC Router has 2 notes\n   - Industrial Mixer has 1 note\n   - Quality Scanner has 1 note\n\n3. **Component test IDs:**\n   - EquipmentDetailHeader: `equipment-detail-header`, `equipment-detail-title-row`, `equipment-detail-title`\n   - Status badge, breadcrumb navigation, and the full EquipmentInfo component with all its subcomponents for photo handling, details panel, edit forms for each field, description section, and related action buttons...\n   - MaintenanceNotes and CommentsSection with all the comment-related elements for displaying and posting comments.\n\nFor the photo upload, I'll need to handle the file chooser dialog that Playwright can intercept using `waitForEvent('filechooser')` and then set the files programmatically. Now I'm planning out the test structure in a new spec file for the EquipmentDetailsPage, starting with navigation to the equipment details page.\n\nSince equipment IDs are UUIDs and can't be hardcoded, I'll navigate to the equipment list first, extract an ID from a row, then navigate to that specific details page. Alternatively, I could just click through from the table directly. For the test scenarios, I'll leverage the seed data—using Industrial Mixer and Conveyor Belt for operational status tests, CNC Router for maintenance status, and checking the description fields that are already populated in the seed data.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the test cases: header tests to verify breadcrumbs and page titles, status badge tests for operational and maintenance states, and info section tests covering photo display, uploads, placeholders, and field visibility.\n\nI'll also need tests for editing equipment details and descriptions to ensure changes persist, plus a full suite for the maintenance notes section—verifying the heading, input controls, note posting, button states, comment formatting with author and date info, chronological ordering, and system-generated notes.\n\nFor navigation, I'm planning a helper function that goes to the equipment list, finds the target equipment by name, extracts its ID, and navigates directly to the details page.\n\nI'm realizing the seed data might not include system-generated notes for ED-NOTES-7, so I'll need to figure out how to handle that test case.\n\nLooking at the spec, system-generated notes should display \"System\" as the author with \"(Auto)\" as the role. Since the seed data doesn't have any of these, I'll create one via the API using a POST request with the appropriate author fields.\n\nFor ED-INFO-1, the seed data doesn't include any photo URLs either, so I'll need to set up a photo upload as part of the test setup before verifying it displays correctly.\n\nNow I'm realizing the photo tests need to be structured carefully since they depend on the upload functionality. I can test ED-INFO-3 first (no photo shows placeholder), then ED-INFO-2 (upload a photo), and finally ED-INFO-1 (verify the uploaded photo displays). But since tests should be independent, ED-INFO-1 will need to upload a photo within its own test before asserting it's displayed.\n\nLooking at the ED-INFO-2 spec more closely, it describes the user clicking on an image area or upload control to upload a new photo.\n\nFor the Playwright implementation, I'll listen for the file chooser event, click the upload area, and set files on the file chooser. I also need to create a small test image buffer within the test file itself.\n\nWriting the test file now... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test file handling... I'm looking at the Breadcrumb component structure now—it uses `>` as a separator with `<a>` links for clickable items and `<span>` for the final item. The ED-HDR-1 test spec requires verifying both that the breadcrumb displays correctly with \"Equipment\" as a link and \"Details: E-4021\" as the final item, then clicking that Equipment link to confirm navigation back to the equipment list page.\n\nI notice the test spec uses \"E-4021\" as an example, but the actual system uses UUID IDs, so I'll need to work with real UUIDs instead. For ED-INFO-2, the photo upload flow involves the component dynamically creating a hidden file input and triggering it, which will open a file chooser dialog in Playwright—I need to handle that interaction and verify the new photo uploads, displays, and persists across navigation.\n\nFor ED-NOTES-7, since the seed data doesn't include system-generated notes, I'll create one via API call with the appropriate system author metadata. For ED-INFO-4, I'm checking the equipment details display against the actual seed data values. I need to check how the `formatDate()` utility formats dates to make sure the installation dates display correctly in the details

This will format dates like \"Jun 10, 2023\" for \"2023-06-10\".\n\nThe `formatDateTime` uses `{ year: \"numeric\", month: \"short\", day: \"numeric\", hour: \"numeric\", minute: \"2-digit\" }` in `en-US` locale. This will format like \"Jun 10, 2023, 8:00 AM\".\n\nBut in the EquipmentInfo component, installation dates use `formatDate()`:\n\n\nIn the EquipmentInfo component, the installation date field calls `formatDate()` on the `equipment.installation_date` value, which converts database strings like \"2023-06-10\" into the readable format \"Jun 10, 2023\". The dates come from the database as ISO strings and get passed directly through the Netlify function without transformation.\n\nFor testing, I should use partial text matching with `.toContainText()` rather than exact date matching, since the `en-US` locale formatting is consistent but regex patterns would be more fragile. Now I'm thinking through the photo upload flow—the component creates a file input element, listens for file selection, reads the file with FileReader, and dispatches an update action...\n\nStill writing upload handler... Writing the test file...\n\nNow I need to verify the comment ordering—the equipment notes endpoint sorts by `created_at DESC`, so Sarah Chen's note about the vibration should appear before Mike Thompson's spindle bearing note since it was created more recently. I'll need to filter comments by their text content to assert the correct order, since individual comment items don't have unique identifiers.\n\nFor the reverse chronological ordering test, I could either insert notes with distinct timestamps or create a new note after the page loads and verify it appears at the top of the list. The second approach would be cleaner and more directly test the ordering behavior.\n\nFor the system-generated notes test, I'll need to POST a note through the API with author_name set to \"System\" and author_role set to \"Auto\". Then I'll set up the test file with appropriate timeouts, data-testid selectors, and helper functions for dynamic IDs. I should also verify that Buffer is available in the Playwright environment for the photo upload test, and I need to understand how the component handles the base64 data URL when dispatching updateEquipment to the backend.\n\nThe photo persistence test needs to check both that the image displays immediately after upload and that it survives a navigation cycle. Since the component creates a temporary input element, Playwright's filechooser event should handle that. For the equipment IDs, I'll need to extract the actual UUIDs from the seed data rather than using placeholder IDs, so I'll create a helper function that navigates to the equipment list and finds the ID by name.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the specific test cases: header tests for breadcrumbs and titles using Conveyor Belt and CNC Router, status badge verification for Operational and Maintenance states, and photo upload tests across different equipment pieces. The ED-INFO-2 test will be the comprehensive one that validates both immediate display and persistence after navigation.\n\nFor the remaining tests, I need to verify placeholder behavior when no photo exists, check all detail fields like model and serial numbers on Conveyor Belt, test editing capabilities on Industrial Mixer and Packaging Line, and then move into the notes section starting with CNC Router to verify the heading and text input placeholder.\n\nNow I'm checking the maintenance notes functionality—verifying the Post Note button behavior when empty versus populated, confirming that posted notes display author, role, date and text in reverse chronological order with the newest at the top, and testing system-generated notes created via API to ensure they show the correct \"(Auto)\" role designation.\n\nI also need to verify that notes persist after a page refresh, and I should be careful about test isolation since the photo upload tests run in parallel—I'll assign different equipment to each test to avoid conflicts.\n\nWriting the test file now... I can use the API to set up the photo before the test runs—I'll make a PUT request to update the equipment's photo_url with a base64-encoded image. Then I'll navigate to the page and verify the photo displays correctly. For the upload test, I'll use the file chooser with the component's upload mechanism, and for the no-photo scenario, I'll just navigate to equipment from the seed data that hasn't been

Let me write the test file. The equipment function handles IDs from path segments: `segments[3]` where segments are from splitting the pathname.\n\nFor PUT: `PUT /.netlify/functions/equipment/<id>` with JSON body.\n\nNow I'll write the full test file. Let me also verify a couple things:\n\n1. The photo upload - uses `COALESCE(${photo_url}, photo_url)` so if photo_url is explicitly set, it will be used.\n2. The API path from Playwright: since baseURL is `http://localhost:8888`, the full path would be `/.netlify/functions/equipment/<id>`.\n\n\nSince tests within the same spec file run sequentially on the same worker, I don't need to worry about parallel conflicts—I can safely modify data in tests knowing they won't interfere with each other.\n\nNow I need to account for the `installation_date` formatting: the seed stores it as a date string like '2023-06-10', and when converted to locale format via `toLocaleDateString`, it becomes \"Jun 10, 2023\"—though the exact output depends on the server's timezone handling.\n\nWriting the test file... Writing test cases... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing the test assertions... Writing test assertions...\n\nNow I'm moving on to test the edit functionality for equipment details—I'll navigate to an Industrial Mixer's detail page and verify the edit button triggers the form to appear. Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Finishing the test assertions...\n\nNow I'm thinking through some potential issues with the test data. The first test should work fine since I'm setting the photo via API and the database function will use it if provided. For the second test though, I'm concerned that \"Packaging Line\" might have been modified by another test in the same file, so I need to be careful about test isolation and data consistency.\n\nFor the notes tests, I need to verify the author name and role match what the component posts with, and I should check the timestamp as well. The approach of posting a new note and verifying it appears at the top is a solid way to confirm reverse chronological ordering. Creating a system note through the API should also work as expected.\n\nNow I'm thinking about the initial note count for Industrial Mixer—there's one note from James Wilson in the seed data, so I need to wait for that to load before counting. The `count()` method in Playwright does auto-wait for element attachment, but it might return 0 if the notes haven't loaded from the API yet. I should add an explicit wait to ensure at least one comment is visible before I start counting.\n\nWaiting for notes to load...\n\nActually, I'm realizing this approach violates the test spec—I shouldn't rely on a fixed record count since other tests might modify the database. Instead, I should focus on verifying that the new note appears after posting, the input clears, and the note displays the correct content with author, role, timestamp, and text. That covers all the requirements for ED-NOTES-3 without brittle counting logic.\n\nWriting the test assertions... I'm checking that the date displays, the note text matches what was posted, and there's exactly one instance of it with no duplicates. Then I'm verifying the note persists by navigating away and back to the equipment page to confirm it's still there.\n\nUsing `Date.now()` in the note text ensures uniqueness so I can filter safely without ambiguity. I should add that same timestamp approach to the other test cases as well, and I need to review how the photo upload handler works.\n\nThe `handlePhotoUpload` function creates a file input element in memory and triggers its click event, which should still fire the file chooser dialog that Playwright can intercept. Playwright's `waitForEvent('filechooser')` handles this scenario correctly even when the input isn't attached to the DOM.\n\nNow I'm finalizing the test file. For ED-NOTES-3, I'll use a unique note text with a timestamp to avoid test conflicts while still verifying the note creation flow works. For ED-INFO-5, I need to check the actual seed data for the Industrial Mixer's location and adjust the test expectations accordingly since the spec example might not match what's in the database. I need to verify that all the detail fields become editable when in edit mode, but the spec only requires me to actually change the Location field and confirm it persists. The directive is clear that I should exercise the exact interactions described in the spec—changing Location specifically—rather than testing every field. Let me finalize the test cases now.\n\nFor the notes verification, I need to check that a new note appears at the top of the comments list with the current user's name, their role, the current date/time, and the note text. Since the Redux slice prepends new notes to keep the newest first, the new note should be the first item in the list after posting.\n\nI'm also thinking through the test structure for ED-INFO-2, where I need to handle the dynamically created file input. I should set up the file chooser listener before triggering the click that opens it.\n\nLooking at the photo upload handler in EquipmentInfo.tsx, it creates a file input element dynamically, sets up handlers for the file selection, and then triggers the click. This means I need to be careful about the timing of my test setup to catch the file chooser event properly. file input, attaches an onchange handler, and clicks it. In Playwright, I need to set up `page.waitForEvent('filechooser')` before the click, then click the element that triggers `handlePhotoUpload`, wait for the filechooser event, and set files on it.\n\nThe click on the placeholder calls `handlePhotoUpload`, which creates the input and clicks it, so the filechooser event should fire when that dynamically created input is clicked. I'll register the listener first, then trigger the click, await the promise, and set the files—that's the standard Playwright pattern for handling file choosers.\n\nFor ED-INFO-3, I need to verify that the \"Packaging Line\" hasn't had a photo set by another test, but since tests run sequentially and I'm not setting a photo for it elsewhere, that should be fine. Now I'm checking what happens in ED-INFO-7 where I'm editing the description. yor Belt - read details), editing the Industrial Mixer's location, reading its description, and editing the Packaging Line's description. For the MaintenanceNotes tests, I'm covering the CNC Router's heading and input functionality, posting notes on the Industrial Mixer, testing button states and comment formatting on the CNC Router, verifying chronological ordering on the Quality Scanner, and checking system notes on the Conveyor Belt.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the test logic - when I change the Industrial Mixer's location in ED-INFO-5, the description read in ED-INFO-6 should remain unchanged since I'm only modifying the location field. Before I write the test file, I need to double-check the date formatting for ED-INFO-4. The Conveyor Belt's installation date is \"2023-06-10\", and with the `formatDate` function using the `en-US` locale with numeric year, short month, and numeric day, it should render as \"Jun 10, 2023\".\n\nHowever, there's a timezone issue - when JavaScript parses \"2023-06-10\" as a Date object, it treats it as UTC midnight, but converting it to a locale string depends on the environment's timezone. In UTC it's \"Jun 10, 2023\", but in US timezones it could shift to \"Jun 9, 2023\". To avoid this flakiness, I'll just verify the year \"2023\" appears in the panel rather than checking the exact formatted date. Looking at the test spec, it expects specific labeled fields like Model and Serial No., so I need to make sure my assertions align with what's actually being displayed.\n\nNow I'm checking the equipment ordering - since there are 6 items and the page size is 5, \"Quality Scanner\" might be on page 2. The equipment appears to be sorted alphabetically, so I need to figure out where it falls in the list.\n\nLooking at the pagination, Quality Scanner would indeed be on page 2. I'm updating the helper function to handle this by checking the current page first, then navigating to subsequent pages if the equipment isn't found.\n\nWriting pagination logic... Writing the test helper function...\n\nActually, I'm realizing the UI navigation approach is fragile since it depends on pagination and data ordering. A cleaner solution would be to call the API directly to fetch the equipment ID by name, which decouples the test from the UI implementation details. I need to check how the installation date gets formatted when displayed. The seed data has it as '2023-06-10', and the component calls `formatDate()` on it, which converts the string to a Date object and formats it with the locale settings. Since `new Date(\"2023-06-10\")` interprets it as UTC midnight, I need to account for timezone differences when verifying the displayed date in the test.\n\nI'll use a flexible regex pattern that matches the expected date format while being timezone-agnostic, then write out the complete test file.\n\nOne more thing to verify: the API requests made through `page.request.put` and `page.request.post` will use the same base URL configured in the test setup, so they should hit the local dev server

Now I'm verifying that the test names align with the spec and checking the implementation against the key directives—making sure navigation targets are precise, side effects are asserted exactly once, I'm avoiding common text selectors in favor of test IDs, and keeping all the data-testid values consistent throughout. The quality checks all passed, so I'm updating the todo list and wrapping up.","signature":"EoAZCkYICxgCKkAQrNOPw9Gco+ewp03s5mkDnFXARjFfwPSV6Y2HBBYwsGerY/Lbxu8npKQP238LpP/5UkkWb63ikLUANZoFfYddEgxjWPTuDnR5TnzJ1FEaDGqTrnGDiB7n1XWcmCIwpHpxethYKOFiIEWkKjNYurElF34KxCzdQoc7VBgwTnBu8spHCqC/NACoVJG6C1qpKucXO9UMimTzd4eDd3zjO+FJglJNImTq+6DuPpDfDdIiy9GReZDTPq3ms3fBskwqn+C1giZqGqR7gWjqKCWpz84pOUbMKTOVGT1c7XyJpb1ZUGr8BEIbhRdYj8oRwRBC8XkUd/GQ/GICm4nAB5AjCEd60PLib6FinV/OfAaC6AqDWKBGYl0GM0zKfWyPMCDkT+xC+OQG3MEZc4igpzsHnFppgF4gTcfSUYJex4sTN4q6Zt3vmTB4bpgYwje8BV6yHb5lvyDV8r2xfiyTTkuau4k0/us19xHpaVxmntGR4A389RrOqjGeOvQFn4gHXsN5LYR2Mp8oQ7mJQyWeudrZxosGitlXPp2a5fVNBqNXzpOkzI0ll6oCmYY51xlxS4Bl8ikXbaCVSoXoLGzGPr36X/GeNSXlwSfodzyN6Bi+P+NdRyCk50Czu7zTwyr+VT/mKDm4CTla4oVNTz3BqccsPtrt9VvTXsx1Owccz8sQoC+zpBSRE7p0H2HOKbw8ZjbuzS2/Vy/b+LsR5eLKQQb0kk9Nsz6T38ET69Ll3agpphDFJ8nO79Qa/QKrz15tSvabgJF7PxuApTQ5KCzmfHHc2wMMO5CYcx41QsKEhpL2tabhYFRA5lbg19RNQfHRDTg0VB8LoD2mPkOHE/bTZDP4C8syWeV1Bj9GNZ8x45CbWyATAG2V3J0bkzD9c6AbYGsJ4wy/FZS+qaPLD3gZFPMWyUOJpjj9zFKeTnmoujN4Wvm+6x8kZmHhWWQpjgSsJ3Z8DAPSJNeNen/+ulJxeomCFXwfWtZYc46Nk9PIrGE2lwzWB3wNj5W5gogCZ1hMCpByEtDuhZbiPv0ly1QpGQUZ2I5Z5//tZC7uF1gH6QqTwIrU7Dr2LmcqeeZYrva6/9ULOlAsbwnR4js3RoaytDoNRaU5PqqEUfcg3smAbqPz9COs8tP1x5SWi/mEPyYbOvaQ4mPN2BaxQCJHV+tEZLUmJyD6G6LiDJXNc2cFA9pG9BxfE2gwhN8x7LirPgCUECog8lPXk/iQ//aaax4p1vgqhughuv/dUJFzOPNKgvjWM07wsT3mXpTko/GpnfKPx6ATN5WoEg/lFsuXP9zY40HeslH/6rh5gS7JNnqfYBCFzUX3L47JamVTN+hgJl+WAfN8zDF1fhrzdB4JPKiRUr6eVy8XSBLygX6pYcJrLUILypMaGx+5TKoGW3r/xv4gYoOGN4HslUKZNqilzDqColSajFTpQnckV/m2vO4+yVkmgYkxfcdBgmcIrciDB5iBi58NSKm/xy3FIQdI79dVyVExm9zDtujsWDM/sCjSFTU50y8iQr3rw4IEfwRu2RaxwqwPhQX04jd5rnJx9UvU+3ZaybPftva88F+thcHXmO9+BnuGoXuooHwQ5Q8aV+UESSlbJJlp0KsqL+KlUYzc7HKRJiaJinjFJ8hLBpD0cWoyk7EBi7QRSeMyJ4I64lVw1Q3UuSXeaYlXafNLlXXmpgS6oGrlHy6x8b3Y8ntx14Ys2NoZqGNlhLQ0PUpE2u34X1FI54mAYxIztUYOqIQ9vFrsodpTBJcLgYYAamnaR55010PhLvNIfFLIcT+zVLpOheUjPZVOnaeChppg/YtMqeOD8ff5zmmVQFuQwnxn1VDvaSOp5AId8ZBTDl2Hkz6kfFo1Jgci9c15HradQbOzbNPb200hM8HfAORkQb7tlN5aCRkayuh2MFa43kloyMo3Pm5k9jwXF74TRTViJyCGn2+UeW4MENTGFWRBn+Q2V5wXVBMHG7qnU66a9MamGa1ekt3eRUx9G+IrFGT1UBON2xDm+u+CCzUWXfrIcv3nej2f7xWLNfC08JHuJqyJO6Ex0vDV6no2b+uD7qmF6lAt3uf8DhzjQJcT5AzXoRbOEO0Wjyq80uHqhVb4GYRvfx4/Hp/wHIpzJmHls0nLeZ+GSnsyWSG8cwVyBYwXvq9twcJ0X3nk2YWZ8Gw0TMsRm81ItALBYHdiY1lY+6y0a+0EcxO9wrbGWErYpwv2Nneh+3vIU8OduiF3YxvtiVnkNw99biaFZiFE9+5BCRADcAKadorZAiFUzZ+33oCwwVsqqZ35Kn0cW53lQes/OkVyuVesGZiQoeaYPazeeG4M+Ovuhz0zKPjBiHdjm8LT02NGTLt29PRWS2Oo16WQtQLCPVhCtL+IoVEeEHKYa9lCCIgCvrepO/+sPSwe9YbNC8VOnwG067UBPW9VrsClfLdpKuqqW0y7P2OCSSPsnn9xi9J8ExYrdCnc2Bb/dHC45iaYLb6SyjqLkf/Ls8eW/GAMWigLFNJmuL339PeugmfjkU97fE0DDsXHN1ouVqGaTpP+vEaL7ePKgEKAf1yfG+8mWphIh3pFsu/iCyfV5z/BobuGMzppi5PIncfoGOBhFzP87Rhnw4Cp6rzqSAfqE/wUp52jAs433NgC812xHu3RUrvFOoPwEnDRIzr5krNNby0ZOVmQb/56CIHY4n5AI/UPtksR/ydkk2JVw6GhB3cIrYoCxCzbWenfjlsilEpD/yAqqwL9AhDJUjxscbSeodwuoD1B1ECCu1GkyOVxDLdc2rjsOnE7dYjIA+sLJr1zGwLvTfl4n0Rkcy3UUH2yWzkLUJlCrVJt4DsOixOMd5Ji0M8CnF8e3wbmr3+Xy5/MQcMdDlR8/xWZhHomWmfVqm4Alj3KJCJTRbiNldLjT0pxHbRufxB7QOEUpfRQ8A4RBrGADGBSlqZL0D2+x0rwwpsT8YZiDBLtHOzU6p0irwTLS1mEVEz610NjKtGaaGKcIMzY2UbYsArpDGnhAnz5js87hwV3buT5yh8fSaQb+8ceRFaw26c3qV9AAM+sCuFfcZDPqCDhihp8wfvA01UejZfazwG5LYMc1+rkh2CmL3jU1Qkp/Bv79N2KvbwXE4hlEIAj9OeuxWYTTL/0qeTaNXM2YeYFChBt2c0PKQNGOKc0mWjqeH4xtcH5jiThdZZdClzvvzp3wTB7mFG7aEPPG82fVUs3uUidy47+1oH7lov1iqhqmAb1gfxz/2KBH3dQTZSqcfURrBKMW9k9YlvtYm3WWJeCiNQvjJl2Y4Q8KxPxgT21V7j8bnxEJ2DQAIIzFajLtZ6nx8ApTUFyPEr83w7YyEnRCtRfHD35ZGaPuSGI20zx/MUtDdmXFvIn7kp9nK0MGSaGrIIcYYbyJtk6Ljlu5dPyLERkTEX4TyQRI5Vhh36r2XHrSRcDj9WRrMsbVHVR+7RKwpvfDIIH4y59WpwWzYp9wfgeNXyTYHoxQyvxPL+YphIKMnMJAWtQlzoHZK53CFT6Gi8Gy4v7SoHPdkxHA+Us50jbtRU6WZRoqkyRuX9L/slmMk0Vs/UcX0WysXNUnifLvBrHDeEkDLTCvpZBIqQO+2c6c6sQ8jY6flC4aClOMdJdSYvkkguj25VQQ0ymRBTssthmK4xsx2bsHtYwB63eBIzh6ekGKdbsAsIomV+EX1z1uUeJExXC8OPrL3OuYuoDi5IjQp8CMNP/ZbKn7O1Jj0cjXKEq5GAVaJGjpLFCkIqy0WSiJ5VsmyyFHIDB5Fl07sQrUBzvpBho8p35fLqAH9yAlSItli83F18eigJrVs4HjfQuJng22AQCj8ay7+t9kbtEOqbDLePl2jrrgrEETd/KyJX4054U70BZ/Kyzjsw+NytVHNUT8cacKpwZ7Z2X0jvr+XtmMZAzzbwF6znqmKrSCvfd7VoTPksiirW6ocIbZCOvJ3AdSMzd9vUNNie/qxdxzbuDIPUdrAYkuWgcNcVMiz9wAkwVMmzrmW39SBaj5OasuElxhy7gBdyrCehiQRqzrYYSAArAprNVwDW0MiuetjxpZDOoXfljUTTyiX6i5JKpwa0W7NW2s9VwW0pXqUZBvHT4GsJmJcpcW7YPuSd6xRKBjBpvPD34dRQRorq2bWwF+zhHD3SA0fUCewYD4o2XU5I86aHvbr50B11mpx/LEtCmsObXmjUN8rcmz474iEemZWs8GwgLF1s+Z5ZQakKa5O7eYrwLczGHnjAXUtGQyPI+lTHa85K7ds68YdfuVD1E9zV1bscLuRsYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7844,"cache_read_input_tokens":109060,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7844,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"99e80a81-e9e3-4c93-8a46-f50d02fdab7b","uuid":"24df3299-c8b4-42c5-92c2-2fb2787d42c5"}
