You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me also check the shared styles to understand what's already available.\n\nLet me now plan and implement all the responsive changes. I'll work through each subtask systematically.\n\nThe main things I need to do:\n\n1. **AccountsPage**: Already has `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the page wrapper. The cards grid uses CSS `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(320px, 1fr))` which should adapt well. I need to check the page header and make cards shrink at small sizes.\n\n2. **AccountDetailPage**: Already has `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. The AccountHeader has a side-by-side layout that needs to stack. The tabs and transactions table need responsive treatment.\n\n\n3. **NewTransactionModal**: Needs width constraints for mobile and the transaction header fields need to stack vertically on small screens.\n\n4. **CreateReportDialog**: The two-panel layout needs to collapse into a single column, and the wider modal needs mobile adjustments.\n\n5. **ReportDetailsPage**: The variance summary card metrics need to wrap, and the detailed report table with 7 columns requires strategic column hiding.\n\n6. **ReportListPage**: The 6-column report table needs column hiding, and header actions should wrap responsively.\n\n7. **Transactions**: Still working through the remaining pages...\n\nNow I'm mapping out the CSS changes needed across all components. The main patterns are hiding columns at smaller breakpoints, stacking multi-column layouts, and ensuring modals and cards wrap their content appropriately on mobile devices. Now I'm going through each component to identify where responsive adjustments are needed—AccountHeader needs to stack vertically on small screens, the search input should scale down, NewTransactionModal needs max-sm tweaks, TransactionHeaderFields should stack at sm, and CreateReportDialog's grid layout needs to collapse to a single column at md breakpoints. I'll handle these through CSS media queries and Tailwind classes.\n\nFor the remaining components, VarianceSummary's flex layout with large gaps needs to wrap tighter on small screens, ReportHeader and ReportListHeader both need flex wrapping at sm, and ReportTable requires progressive column hiding—removing \"Accounts Included\" at lg, then \"Date Range\" at md, with a card-based layout kicking in at 480px. TransactionsTable has a similar multi-column structure that'll need the same responsive treatment.\n\nNow I'm working through the CSS for all these responsive breakpoints and card mode layouts... Still writing responsive styles... Still writing styles... Still writing responsive styles... Still writing responsive styles... Still writing styles... I need to reconsider the CSS structure more carefully. The `.page-title` appears in multiple components, and I'm realizing the `TransactionsTab` and `TransactionsTable` both use `.transactions-table-wrapper .data-table` but have different column counts — the tab version has 5 columns while the page version has 6, so I need to find a way to distinguish between them.\n\nI can use their parent containers as context: the tab lives inside `.account-detail-tabs` while the page version is within `[data-testid=\"transactions-page\"]`. This gives me cleaner selectors for each table variant, and I should also account for the other table types like `ReportTable` and `DetailedReportTable` which have their own wrapper classes. Now I'm checking what Tailwind patterns are already in use across the codebase.\n\nI see the padding utilities are already defined, so most pages are consistent with `className=\"p-6 max-sm:p-3\"`. For the TSX files, I need to update several button components to hide their text labels on smaller screens — things like the \"Generate Reports\" button in AccountsOverviewHeader, the \"New Transaction\" buttons across different headers, and similar actions in ReportHeader and ReportListHeader.\n\nLooking at which buttons actually have icons paired with text, I should wrap just the text portion in `<span className=\"max-sm:hidden\">` for those. The buttons with icons like the generate reports and new transaction buttons are good candidates, while text-only navigation buttons can stay as is.\n\nNow I'm going through each file to apply these changes: wrapping the text labels in the AccountsOverviewHeader, AccountHeader, TransactionsPageHeader, and ReportListHeader components.\n\nFor ReportHeader, those export buttons don't have icons, so hiding the labels would leave empty buttons—instead I'll adjust the flex properties in CSS to prevent overflow at small sizes.\n\nLooking at the existing padding on AccountsPage, I see `p-6 max-sm:p-3` is already applied, so I'll work with that foundation.\n\nThe cards grid uses `minmax(320px, 1fr)` which could cause horizontal scrolling on very small devices, so I should reduce that to `minmax(280px, 1fr)` or switch to `1fr` at small breakpoints.\n\nLet me check the shared page-title styles to see what adjustments might be needed
