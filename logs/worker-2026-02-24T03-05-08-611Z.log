[2026-02-24T02:45:32.506Z] Pushed to sales-crm-2
[2026-02-24T02:45:32.506Z] Running group: 3 job(s) (strategy: strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md)
[2026-02-24T02:45:32.506Z]   - FixViolation: Fix 'Task list shows empty state when no tasks exist' test in tasks-list.spec.ts to test true empty state (data-testid tasks-list-empty with message 'No upcoming tasks. Create a new task to get started.') instead of filtered no-results state (data-testid tasks-list-no-results)
[2026-02-24T02:45:32.506Z]   - FixViolation: Add cross-page side effect verifications to tasks-header.spec.ts (New Task created and New Task with deal) and tasks-list.spec.ts (Mark as Complete and Delete) - after each mutation navigate to the associated client detail page and verify the task appears/disappears in the client Tasks section
[2026-02-24T02:45:32.506Z]   - RunTests: Verify all TasksListPage tests pass after fixes

Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   175→   on what you found.\n   176→\n   177→### Bug Writeup Template\n   178→\n   179→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   180→\n   181→```\n   182→# Bug: <test name>\n   183→\n   184→## Step 1: Evidence\n   185→\n   186→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   187→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   188→no evidence.>\n   189→\n   190→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   191→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   192→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   193→\n   194→## Step 2: Determination\n   195→\n   196→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   197→\n   198→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   199→\n   200→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   201→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   202→```\n   203→\n   204→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   205→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   206→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   207→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   208→\n   209→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   210→\n   211→## Directives\n   212→\n   213→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   214→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   215→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   216→\n   217→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   218→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   219→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   220→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→\n   222→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   223→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   224→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   225→\n   226→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   227→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   228→\n   229→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   230→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   231→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   232→\n   233→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   234→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   235→\n   236→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   237→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   238→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   239→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   240→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   241→\n   242→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   243→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   244→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   245→\n   246→## Tips\n   247→\n   248→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   249→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   250→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   251→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   252→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   253→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   254→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   255→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   256→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   257→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   258→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   259→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   260→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   261→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   262→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   263→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   264→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   265→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   266→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   267→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   268→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   269→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   270→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   271→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   272→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   273→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   274→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   275→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   276→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   277→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   278→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   279→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   280→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   281→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   282→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   283→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   284→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   285→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   286→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   287→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   288→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   289→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2f2d80b5-66a7-48bf-b8eb-37d709784302","uuid":"6e4c45d0-137c-49b9-a4c9-b3b82fe5c665","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial testing job into a single group:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a group to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs.

This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":289,"startLine":1,"totalLines":289}}}

[2026-02-24T02:46:06.863Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01AEDadgnnQaUXywf6pLnbTQ","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear picture. Let me understand the three jobs:\n\n**Job 1: Fix 'Task list shows empty state when no tasks exist' test**\nThe current test (line 392-399) filters to produce zero results and checks for `tasks-list-no-results` with \"No tasks found\". But the test spec says:\n- **Given** there are no upcoming tasks in the system\n- **Then** the tasks list shows an empty state message (e.g., \"No upcoming tasks. Create a new task to get started.\")\n\nSo the test should test true empty state (`data-testid=\"tasks-list-empty\"` with message \"No upcoming tasks. \n\n**Job 2: Add cross-page side effect verifications**\nI need to add assertions that verify task changes propagate to the Client Detail Page's Tasks section. For the \"New Task can be created successfully\" test, I should check that the task appears in the associated client's Tasks section.

There's no actual client detail page with a Tasks section yet. This means:\n\n1. For Job 1 (Fix empty state test): I need to fix the test to test true empty state instead of filtered no-results state.\n\n2. For Job 2 (Add cross-page side effect verifications): The client detail page is a placeholder! There's no Tasks section on it. I need to check if there's a client detail page that was built but just not routed, or if I need to build it.\n\nWait, actually let me re-read the job descriptions:\n- \"after each mutation navigate to the associated client detail page and verify the task appears/disappears in the client Tasks section\"\n\n\nBut the route is just a placeholder component. There's no actual client detail page with a Tasks section implemented yet. So either I need to build that page first, or the test spec is expecting something that doesn't exist yet. I see the core issue now—the test spec requires verifying that tasks appear and disappear in the client's Tasks section, but the Client Detail page is just a placeholder with no actual content. I need to either build out that Tasks section first or acknowledge that these verifications can't be implemented until the page exists. Let me check if there's a way to move forward without completely rebuilding the client detail page, or if I should focus on what can actually be tested right now. is not violating the directives. Make sure to update anything else affected by the changes you are making, in docs/tests.md, the app code, and playwright tests.\"\n\nSo I should fix the app code, test code, and docs. If the client detail page doesn't have a Tasks section, I might need to build one.\n\nBut wait, let me think about scope. The jobs say:\n1. Fix the empty state test\n2. Add cross-page side effect verifications\n3. Run tests\n\nFor job 2, if the client detail page is a placeholder, the cross-page verifications can't work. I either need to:\na) Build enough of the client detail page to support this\nb) Decide this is out of scope and document it\n\nGiven the strategy says \"Fix the relevant documentation / code to make sure it is not violating the directives\", I think I need to build enough of the client detail page's Tasks section for these tests to work.

The client detail page is a PlaceholderPage. For the cross-page side effect verifications, I need to:\n\n1. Build a minimal client detail page that shows tasks for that client (with a Tasks section)\n2. Add the cross-page verifications to the tests\n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. The job says \"after each mutation navigate to the associated client detail page and verify the task appears/disappears in the client Tasks section\". The client detail page needs to have a Tasks section that shows the client's tasks.\n\nCurrently the client detail page is just a placeholder that shows \"Client Detail\" text. \n\nI need to build out the ClientDetailPage component to fetch and display the client's information along with their tasks. The challenge is that the tasks API doesn't have a client filtering parameter, so I'll need to either add that filter to the backend or fetch all tasks and filter them client-side.\n\nThe cleanest approach would be to modify the client detail endpoint to include the associated tasks in the response, then build the page to display both the client info and task list. For the tests to pass, I need the page to be accessible at `/clients/:clientId` and show the relevant tasks there. I could also query the tasks endpoint with a client filter parameter instead. For the actual page, I need a component that loads at the client detail route, fetches both the client info and their associated tasks, then renders them with proper test identifiers so the tests can verify task updates across pages. Let me check the app structure to make sure I'm following the right

Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2f2d80b5-66a7-48bf-b8eb-37d709784302","uuid":"34317809-6cd7-428a-bc77-dd1d68b63f80","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":144,"startLine":1,"totalLines":144}}}

Let me plan my approach:\n\n**Job 1: Fix empty state test**\nThe current test at line 392-399 filters with `tasks-filter-input` to produce zero results and checks for `tasks-list-no-results` with \"No tasks found\". This is testing the filtered no-results state, NOT the true empty state.\n\nThe test spec says:\n- **Given** there are no upcoming tasks in the system\n- **Then** the tasks list shows an empty state message (e.g., \"No upcoming tasks. Create a new task to get started.\")\n\nThe component has two separate states:\n\n\n1. `data-testid=\"tasks-list-empty\"` - when `items.length === 0` - shows \"No upcoming tasks. Create a new task to get started.\"\n2. `data-testid=\"tasks-list-no-results\"` - when `filtered.length === 0` after filtering - shows \"No tasks found\"\n\nTo test the true empty state, I'll complete all existing tasks via API so nothing appears in the upcoming list, rather than trying to set up a separate context or worker.\n\nThe challenge is that tests in the same describe block share the `beforeAll` setup, so marking tasks as completed for one test could break others running in parallel. But since Playwright runs tests within a single describe block serially by default, I can safely modify the shared test data as long as this test runs last and I restore the state afterward.\n\nThe cleanest approach is to use the API to fetch all existing tasks, mark them as completed to trigger the empty state, verify it displays correctly, then restore them to their original state.\n\nWriting the test implementation... Restoring task completion states...\n\nNow I'm thinking about the next piece of work—I need to build out a ClientDetailPage component that can display tasks associated with a specific client. The page should fetch both client data and their related tasks, with proper test identifiers so I can verify tasks appear and disappear across page navigation. For the backend, I'm considering whether to add query parameters to the existing tasks endpoint to filter by client, or handle that filtering differently. Building the client detail page...\n\nI'm rendering a conditional display for the tasks section—if there are no tasks, show an empty state message, otherwise map through and display each task. But looking at the test requirements, I really just need a minimal implementation that verifies tasks appear and disappear across pages, so this basic rendering is sufficient for now even though the full spec mentions checkboxes, due dates, and linked deals.\n\nThe key thing I'm realizing is that the tasks endpoint filters for incomplete tasks only, which means when I mark a task complete or delete it, it should no longer appear on the client detail page—that's how I'll verify those cross-page actions worked. For new task creation, I just need to confirm the task shows up. I should also make sure my data-testid attributes are consistent with what the tests expect, using patterns like `client-task-{taskId}` for individual items. And on the backend side, I need to add client_id filtering to the tasks API so each client only sees their own tasks.\n\nModifying the handleList function to support client_id filtering... I need to add query parameter support to the tasks endpoint since it currently doesn't accept any. I'm mapping out the full set of changes needed: updating the backend handler to pass query parameters and filter by client_id, creating a new ClientDetailPage component to display client info and their tasks, wiring it into the router, and fixing the empty state test.\n\nFor the test files, I need to add cross-page verification checks to ensure tasks created or modified on one page are reflected on the client detail page. The test documentation already specifies these requirements, so I just need to implement them in the actual tests.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the ClientDetailPage implementation. Since the full page hasn't been built yet based on the test documentation, I'll create a minimal version that fetches the client info and their associated tasks, then renders the client name alongside a tasks section. For state management, I should leverage the existing Redux setup with the tasks slice rather than introducing new patterns.\n\nI need to set up the test IDs consistently—using `client-detail-page` for the container, `client-detail-name` for the client name display, and `client-task-{taskId}` for individual task items. On the backend side, I'll modify the tasks list handler to support filtering by `client_id` as an optional query parameter.\n\nWriting the implementation... I need to decide whether to match tasks by their text content or ID for cross-page verification, and using the task title makes sense since those should be unique. Now I'm thinking through the implementation details—the handler needs to properly pass query parameters through to the list function, and I should verify that Netlify automatically parses query strings into `event.queryStringParameters`. With that confirmed, I'm ready to write out all the changes across the backend, component, and tests.\n\nLooking at the scope, I need to update the tasks endpoint to support filtering, create a new client detail page, wire it into the router, and add comprehensive tests. I'm considering whether to split the client detail page into separate components, but that feels like over-engineering for this minimal feature.\n\nThe directive about abstracting JSX into separate components is important, but since the full client detail page will be built later anyway, I'll keep this pragmatic—just create the page with the tasks section inlined for now to get the cross-page tests working.\n\nFor data fetching, I'll use the existing tasks API with a client_id filter since I'm already modifying it. The test pattern will be straightforward: navigate to the client detail page, wait for the tasks section to load, then verify specific tasks are present or absent.\n\nWriting the test code now... I'm adding navigation checks to verify the tasks appear on the client detail pages after creation and disappear after completion. Now I need to verify I'm using the correct client ID for each test—the first two tests use `acmeClient`, and I should check what the third test uses. I need to add `client_id` to the delete test so it actually has a client to verify against, similar to how the complete test already does. I should also make sure the `ClientDetailPage` handles loading states properly since the cross-page navigation tests will need to wait for content to render.\n\nFor the API side, I'm thinking about how to filter tasks by `client_id` when it's provided in the query parameters. The cleanest approach is to modify the existing `handleList` function to accept and use query parameters for filtering, rather than creating a separate handler.\n\nUpdating function signatures...\n\nNow for the frontend, I'm building a ClientDetailPage component that uses local state and direct API calls instead of Redux, keeping it simple. I'm setting up the basic structure with interfaces for client info and tasks, then using `useEffect` to fetch the data on mount.\n\nWriting the component structure... Writing the component structure... I'm realizing I shouldn't duplicate the priority styling logic from TasksList.tsx, and since the tests only verify task presence, I can simplify this to just display the task title.

The tasks API is returning an error because of the `client_id` filter. The error is: `unnamed portal parameter $2 = ''` which means passing an empty string to a UUID column comparison fails. The `client_id` column is likely a UUID type, and comparing a UUID column with an empty string causes a Postgres error.\n\n2. The `beforeAll` hook fails because the `/tasks` endpoint now returns a 500 error, so `data.clients` is undefined.\n\nI need to fix the SQL query. The issue is that when `clientIdFilter` is empty string, the comparison `t.client_id = ${clientIdFilter}` still evaluates (Postgres tries to cast '' to UUID and fails). \n\n\nThe pattern with OR logic doesn't work for UUID columns since Postgres can't cast an empty string to UUID. I should convert the empty string to null before passing it to the SQL query, which will let me use a conditional pattern that checks for null values instead. I'm working through the SQL query approach where I can pass either null or a UUID to conditionally filter by client_id—when null is passed, the IS NULL check bypasses the filter entirely, and when a UUID is provided, Postgres auto-casts it for the comparison.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2061,"cache_read_input_tokens":104477,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2061,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2f2d80b5-66a7-48bf-b8eb-37d709784302","uuid":"9e0f4cfa-490b-4442-9a0d-b1bb358e5046"}

This is because when `clientIdFilter` is `null`, Postgres can't determine the type of the `$1` parameter in `$1 IS NULL`. I need to cast it explicitly.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Instead of using IS NULL, I should use a different pattern for the optional filter. With the neon serverless driver using tagged template literals, I can use a different strategy:\n\nOption 1: Cast the parameter to uuid type:\n```sql\nAND (${clientIdFilter}::uuid IS NULL OR t.client_id = ${clientIdFilter}::uuid)\n\n\n```\n\nOption 2 is the safest approach — using two separate queries depending on whether the filter is provided. But let me reconsider option 1 more carefully. When the neon driver sends null, Postgres doesn't know the type, but the `::uuid` cast might actually help determine it.\n\nActually, the cleanest solution is to use a conditional that branches between two separate queries based on whether the client ID filter exists. This avoids any type ambiguity issues entirely.\n\n```","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2426,"cache_read_input_tokens":107881,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2426,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2f2d80b5-66a7-48bf-b8eb-37d709784302","uuid":"25381319-69af-40e2-aa4b-178f7c506725"}

[2026-02-24T02:55:51.398Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01DWNVQ6MJgdhBjRzPQRZfer","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Good progress! 2 passed, 13 failed. But the failures are interesting:\n\n1. The \"Mark as Complete\" and \"Delete\" tests passed! Those are the ones I added cross-page verifications to.\n2. Tests like \"Task cards display all required elements\" are failing, as well as many others.\n\nLooking at the errors more closely, I see two types:\n1. Tests failing because they're running in parallel and there are duplicate tasks (e.g., `ListTest-Medium-Task` resolved to 3 elements)\n2. Tests that were previously passing are now failing\n\nThe key issue is that the tests run in parallel (2 workers), and both workers run the same describe block, each creating the same test tasks. \n\nAh, I see what's happening now—with `fullyParallel: true`, each test can run in a separate worker, which means `beforeAll` runs once per worker instead of globally, causing multiple workers to create the same test data simultaneously. Looking at the test failures more carefully, I'm realizing the `beforeAll` hook runs at the describe block level, so even with `fullyParallel: true`, tests within the same describe block should share the same setup. Let me trace through which errors are actually related to my changes versus pre-existing issues with the test configuration.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2135,"cache_read_input_tokens":111976,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2135,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2f2d80b5-66a7-48bf-b8eb-37d709784302","uuid":"bf1c9ec5-5419-42b7-9413-56306ee34154"}

Each worker runs `beforeAll`, creating duplicate test tasks. The tests then find multiple elements with the same text, causing strict mode violations.\n\nThis is a pre-existing issue with this test file that was likely masked before or the file wasn't run fully in parallel. But the key issue is: the beforeAll creates tasks that aren't unique per-worker, and with parallel workers, there are duplicate tasks in the shared database.\n\nBut wait - the test script creates ephemeral Neon branches. Each test run gets its own branch. But workers within the same test run share the same branch. \n\nWith multiple workers running `beforeAll` independently, each one creates duplicate task entries. I could add the worker index to task names to make them unique, but that would require changing the test setup. Since this duplicate task problem existed before my changes and my actual modifications are just the empty state fix and cross-page verifications, I should verify whether this was already a known issue.\n\nLet me check the Playwright configuration to see how workers are currently set up.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5115,"cache_read_input_tokens":114111,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5115,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2f2d80b5-66a7-48bf-b8eb-37d709784302","uuid":"aa4f7894-72b7-4a72-af8b-f2182a12f298"}

The `beforeAll` hook runs once per worker, creating duplicates. Since all workers share the same DB branch, they see all the tasks from all workers.\n\nThis is a pre-existing issue unrelated to my changes. But since my job includes \"RunTests: Verify all TasksListPage tests pass\", I need to fix this too.\n\nThe fix is to make the task names unique per-worker by including the workerIndex. Looking at Playwright's API:- `test.info().workerIndex` gives the worker index- In `beforeAll`, I can access it via the `worker` fixture\n\n\nI need to figure out how to access the worker index inside the `beforeAll` hook. `test.info().workerIndex` is available during test execution, but I'm not sure if it works in hooks. Let me try appending the worker index directly to the task names to ensure uniqueness across workers. I'm realizing the core issue: since all workers share the same Neon branch, I need to make task names unique per worker to avoid collisions. I'll use `test.info().workerIndex` to append the worker ID to each task name. I see the issue now — `beforeAll` runs once per worker when tests are split across multiple workers, so I need to capture the worker index and use it to generate unique task names that persist across all tests in that worker's execution. I need to redesign the tests to use unique identifiers per worker by leveraging `test.info().parallelIndex` in the `beforeAll` hook, which will generate a distinct suffix for each parallel worker and ensure test isolation.\n\nActually, let me reconsider—this might be a larger refactor than necessary. The real question is whether `fullyParallel: true` actually distributes tests from the same describe block across workers, or if Playwright keeps them together. Based on the docs, individual tests can split across workers, but tests in the same describe block typically stay together, so the `beforeAll` hook should only run once per describe block per worker, not multiple times.\n\nLooking at the error pattern where task counts are doubling (2, 4, 6, 8), it seems like multiple workers are each running their own `beforeAll`, creating duplicate data. The cleanest fix is to make test data unique per run using a timestamp suffix—I'll add a module-level variable that gets set once in `beforeAll` and reuse it across all tests in that

[2026-02-24T03:00:50.076Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01ETQS8TW3K4jHCVWQ28xAwV","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Interesting - the same suffix `ListTest-High-Task-1771901907894` resolved to 2 elements. This means the same worker ran `beforeAll` twice somehow, or somehow the tasks were duplicated.\n\nWait, looking at this more carefully - the locator resolved to 2 elements with the SAME suffix. This means either:\n1. The `beforeAll` ran twice in the same worker (which shouldn't happen)\n2. Two workers happened to generate the same `Date.now()` value (extremely unlikely)\n3. Something else is going on\n\nLet me check - with `fullyParallel: true`, does `beforeAll` run once per worker, or once per describe block per worker?\n\n\nActually, I think I see what's happening. The test execution pattern shows two workers running in parallel - tests 1 and 2 failed at the same time, then tests 4-15 passed, with 4 and 5 also running simultaneously. With `fullyParallel: true`, tests from the same describe block can split across workers, and each worker runs `beforeAll` independently. The collision on the same timestamp is theoretically possible but extremely unlikely.\n\nThe real issue is that `workerSuffix` is a module-level variable, so each worker gets its own copy when the module loads. Within a single worker, `beforeAll` runs once and sets the suffix. Different workers should generate different suffixes since `Date.now()` is called at different times. But both workers share the same database, so when both workers' `beforeAll` hooks execute, they both create tasks. The suffix should differ between workers unless two workers happen to call `Date.now()` at the exact same millisecond.\n\nLooking at the actual suffix value, both workers created tasks with `1771901907894` — meaning they ran `beforeAll` at the exact same millisecond. This is plausible since the test runner starts all workers simultaneously. I need to add more entropy to the suffix generation. I can use `Math.random()` or combine the timestamp with worker-specific information. Playwright provides `test.info().workerIndex`, which gives a unique integer per worker and should be available in `beforeAll`. I'll modify the suffix to include both the timestamp and the worker index to ensure uniqueness.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the core issue: with `fullyParallel: true`, are tests within the same `test.describe()` block guaranteed to run in the same worker? According to Playwright's documentation, test files run in order within a single worker by default, but with `fullyParallel: true`, all tests across all files run in parallel, which changes the guarantees about worker assignment.\n\nSo the real fix is ensuring the suffix is truly unique per worker rather than relying on timestamps. I'm also looking at the third test failure where clicking a task card isn't navigating to the client detail page—the component has a button with an onClick handler that should navigate to `/clients/${task.client_id}` when the task has a client_id, but it's staying on the /tasks page instead.\n\nThe \"View Details\" button works fine and uses the same route, so the navigation itself isn't broken. The task should have a client_id since it's created in beforeAll and associated with globexClient, but maybe there's a race condition where the empty state test running in parallel is interfering with the task data.\n\nLooking at the timing, the empty state test completes in 12.4s and the failing test starts at 16.6s, so they're sequential. The empty state test marks all incomplete tasks as complete then restores them, but if other workers are creating tasks during that window, those new tasks might not get restored properly, leaving the task missing or in an incomplete state when the next test tries to navigate to it. I see the issue now—the `[chromium]` label refers to the browser project, not the worker assignment, so tests could still be distributed across workers. Looking at the test output more carefully, tests 1 and 2 both took 2.6 seconds, which suggests they ran in parallel rather than sequentially.\n\nI need to tackle two problems: first, add more entropy to the worker suffix to avoid collisions, and second, fix the navigation test that's failing. The issue seems to be with the task creation—when `globexClient` is undefined, the `client_id` becomes undefined, which breaks the click handler's conditional check. click wouldn't navigate.\n\nBut wait, the test found the task card and the task name, and clicked it. The task exists in the DB. But the click didn't navigate. This could be because the task's `client_id` is null, the click handler didn't fire, or navigation failed silently.\n\nLet me check if `globexClient` could be undefined. In the beforeAll, it's looking for 'Globex Solutions' in the seed data. If that client doesn't exist, then `client_id` would be undefined on the task.\n\nBut this would affect other tests too. The \"Priority badges\" test passed, which means the tasks exist. The \"View Details\" test for ListTest-High-Task (which has acmeClient) also failed, but that's a duplicate issue, not navigation.\n\nLooking at the test output, test #15 ran with a 16.6s timeout and kept seeing `http://localhost:8888/tasks` instead of navigating. The click isn't causing navigation at all. I'm wondering if the empty state test restored tasks but left the Redux store in a stale state, even though the beforeEach navigates to `/tasks` to get fresh data.\n\nSetting up the beforeEach... The click handler only navigates if `task.client_id` exists, so if the task was created without a client ID (because `globexClient` wasn't found during beforeAll), the navigation would silently fail. Tests 4-14 passed though, which suggests their beforeAll calls succeeded and found the client. For test #15, I need to trace through what happened in its beforeAll setup. The tasks exist based on the \"Priority badges\" test passing, but that doesn't guarantee they have a `client_id` assigned—the task could've been created without one if `globexClient` was undefined during seeding. I should check the seed data to verify whether Globex Solutions actually

[2026-02-24T03:02:21.616Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01M2JSMD6DY5fPQ8oeNAgC4c","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"OK, the seed data does have both 'Acme Corp' and 'Globex Solutions'. So the issue must be something else.\n\nLooking at the test failures:\n1. **Task cards display all required elements** - strict mode violation: 2 elements found. The suffix `ListTest-High-Task-1771901907894` matched 2 elements. This means `Date.now()` returned the same value for two workers. I need more entropy.\n\n2. **Action menu \"View Details\" navigates** - same issue, 2 elements found.\n\n3. **Clicking a task card navigates** - URL stayed at /tasks. The task was found and visible, but clicking didn't navigate.\n \nI'm wondering if the duplicate task issue is actually causing the navigation failure too. If the locator finds 2 elements instead of 1, the click might be hitting the wrong element or failing silently. Let me trace through the test logic to see if the duplicate suffix is affecting the navigation test as well. The empty state test is completing all incomplete tasks across all workers, then only restoring the ones it originally fetched—so tasks created by other workers during that test would stay completed and not be restored. Since the test tasks for this worker were created in `beforeAll`, they should have the correct suffix, but the issue might be that other workers' tasks are interfering with the test execution.\n\nI think the core fixes are adding more entropy to the suffix to prevent collisions between workers, and checking whether the tasks API is properly returning the `client_id` field since the seed data includes 'Globex Solutions'. I'm also wondering if the `toBeVisible` assertion passed for a different reason—maybe Playwright's behavior with multi-element locators isn't what I expected.\n\nActually, `toBeVisible()` does throw in strict mode, so if it passed, the locator matched exactly one element. That means by test #15, there was only one task with that suffix. The real issue seems to be that the click isn't navigating—possibly because the Redux store doesn't have the `client_id` populated even though the tasks API returns it.\n\nLet me trace through the `handleUpdate` function to see what happens to `client_id` when we restore a task by setting `completed: false`...\n\nExamining the update logic...\n\nWhen `client_id` isn't included in the request body, it's undefined, so the conditional `client_id === undefined ? null : (client_id || null)` evaluates to `null`, which means the SQL executes `client_id = null` and wipes out the existing value. That's the bug—restoring a task clears its client association because the update logic treats missing fields as explicit nulls rather than leaving them unchanged. , there's no COALESCE for `client_id`. The pattern is:\n- `title = COALESCE(${title || null}, title)` - preserves original if null\n- `client_id = ${client_id === undefined ? null : (client_id || null)}` - sets to null if not in request!\n\nThis is a bug in the update function. When you send `{ completed: false }`, the `client_id` is undefined, so it gets set to null. The same applies to `description`, `deal_id`, `assignee`, `assignee_role`, `due_date`.\n\nActually wait, the code says `${client_id === undefined ? null : (client_id || null)}`. If `client_id` is undefined, this evaluates to `null`. Then the SQL `SET client_id = null` would clear it.\n\nBut actually, this is the INTENDED behavior for the COALESCE-style fields like `title` and `priority`. For nullable fields like `client_id`, the pattern allows explicitly clearing them by sending `client_id: \"\"` or `client_id: null`. When the field is omitted (undefined), it should preserve the existing value instead of nullifying it. The current code doesn't do this—it sets undefined fields to null, which is a pre-existing bug that's now affecting my empty state test since the restoration call clears all the other fields.\n\nI need to fix the update function to use COALESCE for nullable fields too, or adjust the empty state test to avoid this issue.\n\nLooking at the SQL more carefully, I see the problem: `title` uses COALESCE to preserve existing values when null, but `description` and `client_id` clear the field when undefined. The inconsistency is causing the bug where sending `{ completed: false }` wipes out other fields. Option 1—fixing the API to consistently use COALESCE for all nullable fields—is the right approach even though it's a bigger change.\n\nBut wait, there's a deeper issue: if I use COALESCE for nullable fields, I can't distinguish between \"user sent an empty string to clear the field\" and \"user didn't send the field at all.\" I need to handle undefined values differently from empty strings—only preserve the existing value when the field is truly omitted from the request.\n\nSince the neon driver doesn't support conditional SQL clauses with tagged templates, I should rethink the test strategy entirely. Rather than trying to restore task state through the API, I could just create fresh tasks after the empty state test runs, avoiding the restoration problem altogether. Though that might complicate the test flow.\n\nThe real issue is that the empty state test is corrupting task data when it restores with partial updates—specifically, it's clearing fields like client_id that weren't meant to be touched. I need to either preserve the full task state before the test or change how the restoration works.\n\nThe cleanest solution is to build the update logic in JavaScript to only include fields that were explicitly provided, rather than trying to handle undefined values in SQL. I'm realizing the cleanest approach is to make the \"Clicking task card\" test self-contained by having it create its own task through the API rather than depending on the beforeAll setup, similar to how the Complete and Delete tests work. I should also add random entropy to the worker suffix to avoid collisions, and ensure the update API properly preserves all fields when doing partial updates. Still writing the update logic...\n\nActually, I realize the real issue is that the test restoration doesn't preserve all the original field values—it only knows the task IDs. Instead of trying to handle undefined fields in the API, I should just make the test restore the complete original state by storing all field values upfront, or simplify the approach by fixing the suffix collision and the nullable field handling together. I'm realizing there's a cleaner approach using COALESCE in the SQL itself—when the JavaScript value is undefined, I'll pass null, and COALESCE will fall back to the existing column value, otherwise it'll use the new value. I'm concerned about the type consistency in PostgreSQL—the CASE expression needs to return the same type across both branches, but since `client_id` is a UUID and the null case also resolves to UUID or null, the types should align. Let me implement this CASE WHEN approach in the update function and test it

Create a new task to get started.\") by marking all incomplete tasks as completed via API, verifying the empty state, then restoring them.\n\n### Job 2: Add cross-page side effect verifications\nRequired building a minimal client detail page with a Tasks section:\n\n- **`netlify/functions/tasks.ts`** - Added `client_id` query parameter support for filtering tasks by client. Also fixed a bug where the update API cleared nullable fields (client_id, deal_id, assignee, etc.) when they weren't included in the request body (using `CASE WHEN` pattern to preserve existing values).\n- **`src/pages/ClientDetailPage.tsx`** - New minimal page showing client name and tasks section.\n- **`src/components/ClientTasksSection.tsx`** - New component fetching and displaying tasks for a specific client.\n- **`src/App.tsx`** - Replaced placeholder with real `ClientDetailPage`.\n- **`tests/tasks-header.spec.ts`** - Added cross-page verifications to \"New Task can be created successfully\" and \"New Task with optional deal association\" tests (navigate to client detail, verify task appears).\n- **`tests/tasks-list.spec.ts`** - Added cross-page verifications to \"Mark as Complete\" (verify task disappears from client page) and \"Delete\" (verify task disappears from client page). Also added `client_id` to the delete test's task creation, and added unique worker suffixes to prevent parallel test collisions.\n\n### Job 3: Test verification\n- All 15 tasks-list tests pass\n- All 7 tasks-header tests pass\n\n<DONE>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":254,"cache_read_input_tokens":121260,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":254,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2f2d80b5-66a7-48bf-b8eb-37d709784302","uuid":"9d956b6f-ef4d-4a8a-a182-596258490efb"}

Also fixed a bug where the update API cleared nullable fields (client_id, deal_id, assignee, etc.) when they weren't included in the request body (using `CASE WHEN` pattern to preserve existing values).\n- **`src/pages/ClientDetailPage.tsx`** - New minimal page showing client name and tasks section.\n- **`src/components/ClientTasksSection.tsx`** - New component fetching and displaying tasks for a specific client.\n- **`src/App.tsx`** - Replaced placeholder with real `ClientDetailPage`.\n- **`tests/tasks-header.spec.ts`** - Added cross-page verifications to \"New Task can be created successfully\" and \"New Task with optional deal association\" tests (navigate to client detail, verify task appears).\n- **`tests/tasks-list.spec.ts`** - Added cross-page verifications to \"Mark as Complete\" (verify task disappears from client page) and \"Delete\" (verify task disappears from client page). Also added `client_id` to the delete test's task creation, and added unique worker suffixes to prevent parallel test collisions.\n\n### Job 3: Test verification\n- All 15 tasks-list tests pass\n- All 7 tasks-header tests pass\n\n<DONE>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"2f2d80b5-66a7-48bf-b8eb-37d709784302","total_cost_usd":5.5617782500000015,"usage":{"input_tokens":70,"cache_creation_input_tokens":225631,"cache_read_input_tokens":6059681,"output_tokens":41095,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":225631},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":70,"outputTokens":41095,"cacheReadInputTokens":6059681,"cacheCreationInputTokens":225631,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":5.46775925,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":17280,"outputTokens":3664,"cacheReadInputTokens":166440,"cacheCreationInputTokens":33420,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.094019,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"ba2790e4-eafa-459c-ad81-817692f21ec3"}
