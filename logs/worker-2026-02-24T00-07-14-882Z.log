This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

[2026-02-24T00:04:57.613Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_012Xysmh2dogDVqmGfxep11A","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear picture. Let me analyze each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecDealDetail\n\nThe DealDetailPage section in docs/tests.md (line 103) is completely empty - it only has the heading \"## DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)\" with no test entries at all.\n\nAccording to the AppSpec.md, the DealDetailPage should have:\n- Header: deal name, associated client, value, owner, current stage with controls to change stage\n- Deal Stage / History section\n- Writeups section\n- Linked Tasks section\n- Attachments section\n- Contacts/Individuals section\n\n\n- \nThe testSpec.md requirements are clear: I need to systematically document every visible element, write test entries for each one, specify exact navigation targets for clickable items, verify persistence for data mutations, check button appearance, fully test modals, support file uploads for attachments, specify data formats for imports, and confirm state changes propagate throughout the app. The DealDetailPage has zero test entries, which is a complete violation of these standards. I should identify this as a violation and flag it for fixing rather than implementing the fix myself.\n\nLooking at the strategy more carefully, my job during this checking phase is to read the directives and scan the documentation for violations. The tests.md file shows that only Sidebar Navigation has test entries while all other pages—including DealDetailPage—are empty sections. This suggests the test entries haven't been written yet. I need to determine whether reporting an empty section counts as a violation or if I should note that the tests simply haven't been authored. Looking at the test file structure, I see that only Sidebar Navigation has actual test entries while all the page sections—including DealDetailPage—are empty headers. The key distinction is that the checkDirectives strategy evaluates violations of specific rules about how test entries should be written, not whether entries exist at all, so an empty section means there are simply no entries to assess against those directives.\n\nLet me check the git history to see how previous check jobs handled similar situations and what pattern they followed.","signature":"EootCkYICxgCKkBviGWiP3AB9GJ1XWSjqupEgFqAJL8jmmdM8OlvqHlDsrbejCmw+DPHwgnGKGhLCDyJqmTyQhaj7zSoSkC7Nh1cEgygcRVK30w0sAdVo6EaDMiEk50ZMewBoK/6TCIwv4Hi6TKasPFR0Dbo1vG7/VtN0Hgj6lmLcZ+TuxjX5yJFO6DRTdPgbL77xE2dCQ0IKvErn5hRT4S7JyjyLP+Mx+sE4EU2AWNi4jvm12XcvVbzguzceLdwTlZaDrQNzZ/B0JGnatJQi/W6X+7jRnLj5h/GnX0rh9JxJ5NOUqW1HwStjlfBRYqFa7aqNEcuZLVqHmwhQy9WarBoQ2SQE/iOUb5nozSM1t8XeMe5D6EFBG1yafo/uL8eGRGkjrSLw9eelBRsOIGcSksQM/gige8g8Y8RcWNCg2R5XHSuXFDhQdzvvUgMjE3NuCmkmlNAgSZBmCbm3ap9L0vxDCWF6l62YN2OQRCya4LlnpyBIQjHRSGQnIacpp1rY1+0gkvhzfe7H+i3UhpzSTjW0cOF9hy2KvLPa85cQm8T8OmJQuE6jSyoWye7vYNqCcNh2P2ArFjl9Ero131OdYpkJXi07jVbEqV9U1/Vox9wjObA1s3rQa2wY0spshXRwGjkzW0fYMLApun7qI6iVCXECW+pxoq06EBnxA375e55Ozguu+AWvJMhy1BJEJk9EHEseczPVyIqznkSazigEW4HvsSGGJWiNkNuEKm9h7vFZIwoRmGWY5psc8rgcj1ksFI1lmEcZT3WXNoY/3jI+hBF5Y7n/kkOlGLRCrX7mhAIoVHpwm7LZZsqpRsj0w9fKoNRryzNIhMRaWPQbG1LCbW80kyFPNsr5OABh00eWy2n1iTD9xZWOllmqSGCBz1s3H5l5W94Joa/Eumk77Nba/eJDJWFokA2gYo4gQHfJ0saD3c3XSEdlkI4SxqFHoEYcqXD+HPzrBtr4qMo8oMm6g0AeeYIpSCZLJYKLsolY3BL088pBFwlgHoTpHjD8HL4FhISV6MICZzsiT/WEQwzIg8IgmsJGQ4/csvkJzb3P2SVXSNeDqO7KylG1+gAiYo8gvH7w67NkinIWQaNfJlw3wqDabN6aQnE1MuCCozfIruJvAooaMLCcYNcxzq0po/+fcp5OLXiKdsTM1ydwsQXk3MyLdh2x4J60cmMYFCnFuBdtGkNgpXbJ5Buueifdp2zI4K+N3DAb4eIw2WVVuKWZaH3jz/iI0Zy9opwL+fzN7hTak2EC+Ja5ieGTMtEpYvXzwC+j+NCEpvBRQJ9NS+ygblCulUymDXQIj4oftd6c3Dlvc5zwJLyZykuq2y4Msiq9dv0NW3cSMLxxltt/RG5Me3xAQYobKj91W6MBr6l3afoOCDNUCjuwmkIAD7oXxz12rR1jeG0NfuNWaW+lkRwR2vT87/QbsMRvHYI5/Aw8a9TxXLWDlClAxpUVybkpWeDCezqauXS91UeDvZeqWZBC46iI53sNHOe1Je5TB+Nr2wLu9JFD0XEbCLxP1NRliJaWceuBq5dsX9w3oKp8e/lIT8pVYac4czXJNOA77z3YpHhV/zWV33PT1lOKUMqU/tAPmAS7fnmKp5K+Vup9aQcFW584jOmpePI1bt4WOFkKXQ6sJuCTnKSI8w112sFgzoUQpZmlUgoU9vJrGgz69ZWKuAEbxv+PAoBSPw54FPaccZqnbDysUy0fjDf68/89GqwX79xYzTKaajoWI6/nkgyVd0kCjNf2gb/D3MaPPNJpXj2xfEBSjnEqTlq9RFFK6k+9yVSFSHS8Q78zM5Drdbxot9cxxmdyowHgNW21Y/zhWqnI3Z16IDHjVqKl14x9a1k5wSg9T2iCsKz1/Wit4yCMds0VHVTXEzbr8Vx4u/yNxGcMSGCYcl5AHZH6C8V6BNGSgv+IDgrpYss2LJ6ponuU+4jDsUd+77AjA2lQ6BTZEZj5ncAuRejLm6v6v1g5W/fBGLmVJ43KJ+V6U4Zxm/edEA1xpECMr5YIyhk5R4s4F9h9aoZsY01C5wOT88eFRBi5Ib+K+9/wdN//wd9drxNK1wbHVp9AMncCmVQImFDDdeOjhZXzPShW4lgocOppZh3FNriVqSUL34oetlKn0H+tAyvFX2QSgX0odwZ9pCD5pmS4EbghCCsVy7x3G2EHWm8b9HGBUfZ0447o0VqvFP7u/TsEvW/08khIF/zgln4SaVErAUoBRx73bhoW3yqNCn0FiildnTOf2iX/+jFhMaRIVaSy3cPLftKO7qm/CsApETM6p1TzI28D/iQYRAyyRTf/IZ4qBXOSvZ0jD/ZrrWrXi5vdU6hLWRqvJUOPkdiEV+0TvX9Y9BX3oS4ifd2+Vr/2LSPJlPuPmCCOM69gDEI0TZmK4rrOleZQQSwiENtVrIwHMK5BiDl727kPDkDXvnHVL2WF8igx0GWxGI9OjuqlYxs/xvi+vfetA+lQajQFFAKLOFkIwKb8DpOmFFNJoQs6Wg/rsvy5Hbom4FTe07XEBl+GnWW7lV4nXbxJL+6iKKpOg5pHWoIV1JLSikMPQeZ/7j1N1IWjyDd5EI6oRphcLbbq50K3TB4hkJBXVhzkAeSMBEMVbC4chscXuQ/4orSajUbIu7q6m1Spkz6cs8bZsBs6XxsglBBLiOpTGF0SVLHeRIQ3qpq14/P9S460/MD/DcQ6qsvu+MelGRJHBnvADq/qyu96bz/7Gppya4XLwM140NHSE6he7SPaBWtRHJGCr5LzH8v6tnTiQnngJ/tYPyULPe0SjM7BX+qeiz3KN8LkQ34D0+WlQegcZ0Iclw26jUbdIyELpv8ag9eeROSoQirX5w47BIb78hDFxToTergCFwhEIKZ6siuTSEKY9peBJPNQ8JmIsvI54+Z9lSdNFTlBgLJh6rRqNso49l5odkYEHvsZkHaa3MUFwMaKvtFGdLkVzWLEonVP4HBtGYXaAEqfB52E+SueH4wiAhvQNBkyRfYcwB0ydQiVemSL+HdXxSfrMTkjp514V7ypb+N6YYJQcZODR8gVvidoE90+3BaEMhVAFcFboXWhQsWCscDU+9Z/3Kp2puaXRlQsgNoXmmmfXyizpqkECvV7qC2gQ8A1hqrQkQdyQCwUbKDa5LHoJ0HifWI6Q94/RnHo9eoXFQdbplca/eAkz0ANGopq30ijoR5D4tb9rm6uoRayniT9jODdPL4n14HxEzgtPc9q5io4yoTnl2t/LvvVrW/ZaeUhWAYmt7PH7pYxULISFPjV3YAHtfxUXGPat14FqB/n2Y4TwDB7arbaPrq0D5Y/2YyFYjAuVvlPT1Yugnr/qd4dIFKHdr6zyvg+jXALWMDwXfkXQTxu4gIKsFKBgL6zQu/nRSH14GSZsahRayKeze9J7OtaSE76sWFvdH9hp1rw3IJGbvxft5YxifGv6YhNbAUfzUpdPUg9Y6uOdiv1n7W2RMA8plKqjb1KFM7QluFE+uKlOoeSWnbufn0vZ0QpD8wi8nvta4yzWHo3/Cbt8WvT0IhqCbucRJ15yfyGXq1F3jLLI88AqNPX+nkdnBQ4HNmxfl3w7D6HSER3aRGx08qeYVvAQw/XxfZ7V68Dyvo0cJhtJfI0/7w2h+r7hSyDhPiCXmLfyRyS8vZYozb/SHBN6gVsf/SXmvrA5FieSehOG4lwVx/Odm8PkzRsytyJ1b2DxkKz79sr1Qodlym9cPpmsIJ3qUwz6LeG5LzVNh5fcf59O9j1VDvNAoKJTIYhh9/WpOpp0VXj0g7QPD+t5VYu7gjKdqHuA+lSS6dfbV/su5jI128iugGCVi2UZBewwfrTWHVoz1/OMbX9QZa4HZknQK2VU1VQhC5ZOJG/kXIb0GVsBJgOgxXF1Jf4IrmT3WJToaoO6CDoZtZCceu6CjFRLgSPBM5nOFvd1a/SEs51QmRHf3JATvhbKAWZ9aciVPB9lUzkKo6glpYiQGVo7Cvacpk2v7tdeSJQWK/ybtIS+uOop+wduzog17L1X8PEoHNVM8FJtsX2b5DbJN05f6Cxxr79M88BaJReGw9ZHFkZECrVLfS7HLp7Pz0XToIvT/eF06qS5WLJ7Fbzse3VmzhXn9ihL0Ls58n6IWGgyLOiOVQGHmhB6S6HUGiKJ925uIqkm1WOt+XvEq8ug0fzJURlWWZ37ur46n0VhJ17raqHrhYEB0E0hzJWGW0Vj4GlBB+YnM65oNsD2lY/LmMJMPMt1L4GiripRQg7LZGA98peTUU527jA5O7E44sgc8dS2fo8VfJkVqx3ZfaVTGmkIr23uAN3nhHuip6Qjf7NFBIZ4EG8uz1FExV4Vh9pe4gZbkbcDY2GC4NDY6cTl/4ypaI1ntavOsDLZ+4oFUaRHWLBQEXyJDG6WrqMHROkb3Hh9X1cgBB5ApfQUNFBsSMPSUxQzxsA3+X34q0LJH0cXQ+uPopwBOlyBGb4PsjeHQLw+h5qcDn4WDO8/HDjW+Nwu5pVko6QHthlClP4K8CAcnMSybTaSVSqQ7yA04SOf7zaod+9240XS96R3JHRaRaovQtPyetjDTypviLntwnibkS5pDMIJ1dCDRfgQsRNuY5Z6DClr8lT1hLCvy1cTcEGUhFMSVe7TD/tMckx7xT3iDTfzDt0BOn231tJ4Ufn29yr07zEEnQ4y02pn3TNr9QJlmhgkt2bVYR0RJvQuK1ghYs0weY6t43CRbLScyF0tojAN5zljHYRGD2fLmsgvIV6GhVXQQtBmau062McBAD5YtUMxNAqgdThUOwYZz91CUd+zkgjVyguXXAw9RSmFnBFcrrXcSgmXk1v3TRj09uyTCN2hU9CJIp10cL+hcmoHsRqRiUEshUxP7lvCrta1fZjb1nKQ/nBH7W1K9pXMkXaRN8wFu+qgALuizml/bM90MZDzMM9PMAiBAp6EcIe0cDrjjOOnAnDEN3acCkgAr0ZPTFzVDU/DCog7PmSY/bIyA7DdHF9R2O

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\\n    29→\\n    30→## Database Schema\\n    31→\\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`).

It must NOT read\\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\\n    44→\\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\\n    48→\\n    49→## Directives\\n    50→\\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\\n    52→\\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\\n\\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\\n\\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\\n\\nFirst, add a setup group:\\n```\\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \\\"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\\\" \\\\\\n  --job \\\"SetupApp: Setup the app\\\" \\\\\\n  --job \\\"DesignDatabase: Design the database\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\\n```\\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \\\"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\\\" \\\\\\n  --job \\\"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\\\" \\\\\\n  --job \\\"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\\\" \\\\\\n  --job \\\"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Guidelines\\n\\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\\n\\n## Database Schema\\n\\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\\n\\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\\n\\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\\n\\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\\n\\n## Directives\\n\\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\\n\\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\\n\\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target.

Multi-step\\n    89→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\\n    90→\\n    91→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\\n    92→  the app directory.

Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\\n    97→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested.

This catches issues like email\\n   104→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\\n   105→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\\n   106→\\n   107→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\\n   108→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\\n   109→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\\n   110→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\\n   111→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\\n   112→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\\n   113→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Tests across\\n   122→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\\n   123→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\\n   124→  in the database (e.g., \\\"expect 5 clients\\\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\\n   125→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\\n   126→  assertions (\\\"at least N\\\", \\\"contains this item\\\").\\n   127→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\\n   128→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\\n   129→  being unmodified.\\n   130→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests.

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\\n\\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\\n\\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\\n\\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\\n\\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \\\"file picker opens\\\", \\\"select a\\n  file to upload\\\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\\n\\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\\n\\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\\n  ```ts\\n  await expect(async () => {\\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\\\"card-\\\"]');\\n    const count = await cards.count();\\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\\n    }\\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\\n  ```\\n\\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\\n  ```ts\\n  await expect(\\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\\\"card-\\\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\\n  ```\\n\\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\\n\\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\\n\\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\\n  under load or recording.\\n\\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\\n\\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\\n\\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \\\"edit client\\n  field\\\", \\\"change value\\\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\\n\\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\\n\\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\\n\\n## Parallel Test Design\\n\\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\\nWrite tests with this in mind:\\n\\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\\n  in the database (e.g., \\\"expect 5 clients\\\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\\n  assertions (\\\"at least N\\\", \\\"contains this item\\\").\\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\\n  being unmodified.\\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\\n  you need to interact with.\\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load.

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\\n    28→\\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\\n    38→\\n    39→## Directives\\n    40→\\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\\n    42→\\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\\n    44→\\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\\n    46→\\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\\n    48→\\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\\n    50→\\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\\n    52→\\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\\n    54→\\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\\n    56→\\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\\n    58→\\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\\n    65→\\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\\n    69→\\n    70→## Tips\\n    71→\\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\\n    75→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\\n    76→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\\n\\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\\n\\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\\n\\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\\n```\\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \\\"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\\\" \\\\\\n  --job \\\"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\\n```\\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \\\"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\\\" \\\\\\n  --job \\\"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\\\" \\\\\\n  --job \\\"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\\\" \\\\\\n  --job \\\"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Requirements\\n\\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\\n\\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\\n- Test entries must all have titles.\\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\\n\\n## Directives\\n\\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\\n\\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\\n\\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\\n\\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\\n\\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\\n\\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\\n\\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\\n\\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\\n\\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\\n\\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\\n\\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\\n\\n## Tips\\n\\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\\n  interleave downloads and reads.\\n\",\"numLines\":82,\"startLine\":1,\"totalLines\":82}}}\n+[2026-02-23T23:59:49.339Z] {\"type\":\"assistant\",\"message\":{\"model\":\"claude-opus-4-6\",\"id\":\"msg_014o4Cb3K7YsTFrs5k8Pk1wS\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"tool_use\",\"id\":\"toolu_01C5kThSsWVsLD7nQmRUUhey\",\"name\":\"Read\",\"input\":{\"file_path\":\"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\"},\"caller\":{\"type\":\"direct\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":217,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":26162,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":217,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":18,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"global\"},\"context_management\":null},\"parent_tool_use_id\":null,\"session_id\":\"bf8a7a20-f468-45b0-86b3-14c8316983a2\",\"uuid\":\"39000773-1424-454a-b87a-d0648869773e\"}\n+[2026-02-23T23:59:49.347Z] {\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01C5kThSsWVsLD7nQmRUUhey\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"     1→# Strategy\\n     2→\\n     3→You are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

Now I understand the pattern. Let me now proceed systematically with my three jobs. \n\nThe key insight from the previous checks: the pages (other than Sidebar) have empty test spec sections and are placeholder components. So when I check, I should find:\n\n1. **CheckTestSpecDealDetail**: The DealDetailPage section in docs/tests.md is completely empty (just a header on line 103). There are no test entries, so there are no directive violations because there's nothing to violate. This is not itself a \"violation\" - the check is about whether existing entries follow the directives, not about whether entries exist.\n\n\n2. **CheckComponentsDealDetail**: The DealDetailPage component is a minimal placeholder with basic styling attributes, but it violates the \"No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data\" guideline since it lacks any real functionality.\n3. **CheckTestsDealDetail**: No Playwright test files exist for DealDetailPage, so there are no tests to validate against the directives.\n\nNow I'm refocusing on what the checkDirectives strategy actually requires—I need to examine the **Directives** sections specifically, not the Guidelines. For writeApp.md, the DealDetailPage has the required `data-testid` attribute, but I should verify it against the other specific directives listed.\n\nLooking at the visual appearance directive, the placeholder component doesn't match the mockup at all, which is a violation. I also need to check whether all JSX elements are properly rendered according to the directives. The main issue is that the component doesn't match the mockup yet, but that's because the page is still a placeholder rather than a violation of existing code. Since there are no tests for DealDetailPage, I can't evaluate the writeTests.md directives either.\n\nI'll move forward by checking each job systematically against the
