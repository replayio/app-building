Let me check what the diff actually shows for the merge result vs the local branch. The diff I ran was between local^1 and remote^2 — that shows what the remote had different from local.

Its parents are `09084a2` (local, with SalesCRM) and `321dec5` (main, without SalesCRM). With `--theirs`, the merge result should have accepted main's version, which means no SalesCRM app.\n\n\nBut the SalesCRM app is still showing up, so maybe `--theirs` only resolved the conflicting files and didn't remove files that existed only on the local side. Let me look at what the merge commit actually contains for the SalesCRM app.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":673,"cache_read_input_tokens":34680,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":673,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"59fc0375-91c7-45db-80de-06b26ad1052a","uuid":"8ce84a5a-8269-4af1-9595-20d01cd5b7d9"}

The files that both sides modified would be the ones with conflicts. The local branch had the old `strategies/` layout, and main renamed to `skills/`. \n\nActually, let me look more carefully. The diff between the two parents shows that main deleted the entire SalesCRM app directory. \n\nSince SalesCRM still exists in the merge result, it was only added on the local branch and wasn't a conflicting file, so it got preserved.

The local branch (09084a2) was based on an older version of main that had `strategies/` instead of `skills/`, old scripts like `add-group.ts` instead of `add-task.ts`, and old versions of infrastructure files. \n\nThe merge accepted `--theirs` (main's version), which:\n1. Correctly brought in the `skills/` directory structure (replacing `strategies/`)\n2. Correctly brought in `add-task.ts` (replacing `add-group.ts`)\n3. Updated infrastructure files in `src/` to main's versions\n4. Preserved the SalesCRM app (since it was only on the local branch, no conflict)\n\n\nThe `--theirs` resolution was actually the right call—the local branch's infrastructure changes were outdated, and main had the latest versions. Now I need to figure out whether the local branch made any meaningful infrastructure changes that got lost in the process, or if it was just working with stale versions from when it originally branched off.\n\nLet me verify the merge worked correctly by running the type checker, and then I'll investigate whether there were any important infrastructure modifications on the local branch that I should be aware of.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1107,"cache_read_input_tokens":37460,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1107,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"59fc0375-91c7-45db-80de-06b26ad1052a","uuid":"cbfad735-96f0-404a-8f19-3760fb40a1eb"}
