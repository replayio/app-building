Since none exist, maybe they haven't been created yet.\n\nLet me check if the task is specifically about a particular app. The subtask says \"Unpack: Review fixed bug reports\" - this is the unpack step where I need to check for unreviewed bug reports.\n\nSince there are no `bugReports.md` files at all, there can't be any unreviewed bug reports. The skill says:\n\n\nIf there are any unreviewed bug reports in bugReports.md, add one task per bug. Since no bugReports.md files exist anywhere in the apps directories, there are no unreviewed bug reports to process.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1415,"cache_read_input_tokens":29383,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1415,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7408afce-de30-4bc8-a5bc-442b546003eb","uuid":"9199a41b-0429-4fce-ab3e-eae4ee576282"}
