[2026-02-24T02:01:00.195Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01KGCxVcWECsWYHBC8uE58Av","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I understand the structure. I need to identify all the pages from the tests.md file and create job groups for each page. Let me list the pages:\n\n1. Sidebar Navigation (not a page per se, but a component area)\n2. ClientsListPage (/clients) - empty, no tests yet\n3. ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId) - empty, no tests yet\n4. PersonDetailPage (/individuals/:individualId) - empty, no tests yet\n5. DealsListPage (/deals) - empty, no tests yet\n6. DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId) - empty, no tests yet\n\n\n7. TasksListPage (/tasks) - has tests\n8. TaskDetailPage (/tasks/:taskId) - has tests\n9. ContactsListPage (/contacts) - has tests\n10. SettingsPage (/settings) - has tests\n11. UsersListPage - Team (/users) - has tests\n12. UserDetailPage (/users/:userId) - has tests\n13. ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password) - has tests\n14. ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password) - has tests\n15. ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email) - has tests\n\nLooking at which pages actually have test entries defined versus which ones are empty. The ones with content are TasksListPage, TaskDetailPage, ContactsListPage, SettingsPage, UsersListPage, UserDetailPage, and the auth pages, while ClientsListPage, ClientDetailPage, PersonDetailPage, DealsListPage, and DealDetailPage have no test entries at all. So I should only create job groups for the pages that have something to check—the empty ones won't have any test specs to validate. Looking at the test entries, those five pages only have headers with no actual test specifications listed. Even though they might not have components built yet, the strategy is clear about adding one group per page, so I should include all of them regardless.\n\nNow I'm mapping out all the pages I need to create job groups for: the sidebar navigation component, the various client, person, deal, task, and contact pages, plus authentication pages like forgot password and reset password, and user management pages. That's quite a few groups to organize, so I'll need to think about how to structure them logically—treating the sidebar as a page-level component even though it's not a full page itself.\n\nLooking at the job template structure, I realize that even if some pages don't have test spec entries yet, I should still include all three job types (testSpec, components, and tests) since the checker can skip empty sections. I'll create a shorthand naming convention for each page to keep the command syntax clean and manageable.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering the scope—generating 16 separate job groups seems excessive. I should focus on pages that actually have content in their test entries rather than creating jobs for empty sections. Looking at what's documented, only a handful of pages have meaningful test specifications and implementations, so I'll narrow down to just those with actual entries.\n\nThat brings me to around 11 groups total, which is much more manageable. For the pages without any test content—like the client and deal pages—there's nothing to validate anyway, so skipping them makes sense.\n\nNow I need to execute the add-group commands in the right order. Since add-group typically places new groups at the front by default, I'll need to either reverse the order of my additions or use the trailing flag to ensure they process
