Let me write the analysis files for each log. Let me first write the analysis files for logs 135-138, then the rest.\n\nLet me analyze each log for shell commands:\n\n**Log 135** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-135): testSpec task for TasksListPage\nShell commands:\n1. `find /repo/apps -type d -maxdepth 1 | sort` - finding app directories\n2. `curl -L -o /tmp/tasks-list-mockup.png \"https://utfs.io/f/...\"` - downloading mockup image\n\n\n3. `ls /repo/apps/` - listing app directories\n4. `wc -l /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs` - counting lines in docs\n\n**Log 136** (worker-app-building-knfcm0-136): testSpec task for TaskDetailPage\nShell commands:\n1. `find /repo/apps -maxdepth 2 -name \"*.md\"` - finding markdown files\n2. `ls /repo/apps/` - listing app directories\n3. `wc -l /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs` - counting lines in docs\n\nAll succeeded.\n\n**Log 137**: No shell commands visible in the main log output, just tool calls like read, glob, grep, edit, and TodoWrite.\n\n**Log 138**: Multiple commands executed via the Task tool and direct Bash calls—listing directories, finding AppSpec.md files, counting lines in the tests file, and reading the task queue.\n\n**Log 135**: The Task agent found app directories, and a direct command downloaded a mockup image from a URL. Both succeeded.\n\n**Log 136**: The Task agent ran several commands to list app directories, find markdown files excluding node_modules, check docs folders, and locate the tests.md file specifically. All four commands succeeded.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether to count subagent commands in my tally. The report asks for shell command invocations generically, so I think they should be included. Let me look at log 136 more carefully to make sure I have the right commands listed. Looking at the logs more carefully, I can see the Task subagent ran several find and ls commands to explore the /repo/apps directory structure—searching for specific markdown files like AppSpec.md, AppRevisions.md, and tests.md across different app folders. Looking at Log 14, I'm seeing a much longer sequence of commands focused on the Accounting app—searching for test files, exploring the directory structure, checking for Replay runtime installations, and setting up environment variables for testing infrastructure.\n\nNow I'm verifying the Neon API key and using it to list existing projects, then attempting to create a new project twice (likely hitting an issue the first time), initializing the database schema with the connection string, and finally running the accounts page test with the project ID set. I'm going through the shell commands systematically to get a complete picture of the Accounting app structure—checking for test files, examining the scripts directory, looking at TypeScript source files, and trying to visualize the directory tree to understand the layout better. I'm continuing to verify the setup by querying the Neon API to list existing projects, then attempting to create a new one—the first request returned incomplete data, but the second succeeded. After that, I'm initializing the database schema in the Accounting app and checking what tests are available.\n\nNow I'm looking at the Netlify functions directory, then running the test suite with the project ID set, creating a logs directory to capture output, checking if an environment file exists, and finally adding a task to track the testing work that needs to be completed.\n\nI had to set up a Neon project and made a couple of attempts with curl to get the POST request working. Looking at the subsequent logs, I'm examining the repository structure across different apps and checking test documentation—Log 140 shows a quick scan of the SalesCRM test specs with just four basic directory and file commands, while Log 141 starts checking task files across the repository.\n\nNow I'm diving deeper into the SalesCRM setup and database configuration in Log 142, running a more comprehensive set of commands including directory listings, finding TypeScript and JSON files, and performing a TypeScript type check to validate the codebase. I'm running the Vite build and npm check commands to validate the project, then examining the repository structure and SalesCRM app contents through a series of directory and file listings to understand the codebase layout.\n\nNow I'm checking the shared utilities and components across the apps directory, looking at TypeScript files and the styling and layout modules—about 20 commands total that all ran successfully, with just a minor hiccup where the eslint config was missing but got created.\n\nMoving on to the next task where I'm building out the Sidebar components for the writeApp, starting by reviewing the recent commits and app structure again. I've explored the directory structure across the SalesCRM and shared apps, checked for documentation files like AppStyle.md and AGENTS.md, and ran TypeScript and build checks—all came back clean. Now I'm ready to generate the ten analysis
