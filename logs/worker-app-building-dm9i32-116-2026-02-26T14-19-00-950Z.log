[2026-02-26T14:12:12.834Z] Running task: 2 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md)
[2026-02-26T14:12:12.834Z]   - FixViolationTasksListAssigneeRole: Fix missing assignee role display in TaskCardList. Test entry says 'name with role (e.g., Sarah J. (PM))' but component only shows assigneeName. Need to: (1) add role column to users table in schema.ts, (2) update backend tasks.ts query to JOIN and return assignee role, (3) add assigneeRole to Task interface in tasksSlice.ts, (4) update TaskCardList.tsx to display role in parentheses. Also update docs/tests.md if needed.
[2026-02-26T14:12:12.834Z]   - RunTests: Verify tests pass after fix

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6.

Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   329→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   330→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   331→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n   332→  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n   333→  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n   334→- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n   335→  the component source.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}

The `Task` interface doesn't have an `assigneeRole` field, and the backend doesn't return it. The `users` table also doesn't have a `role` column.\n\n\nI need to add the role field across the stack—starting with the database schema, then updating the backend query to fetch it, adding it to the Task interface, and finally updating the component to display it. I should also check if there's seed data that needs updating and whether there are existing tests I need to verify.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7809,"cache_read_input_tokens":45529,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7809,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6a1f517a-15b0-4062-b01a-12f0190a58f4","uuid":"9ad3a8bb-a41e-486a-aa97-2514d650f732"}

Let me check those more thoroughly to see if they also need the `assigneeRole` field. But first, let me check the backend functions for client-detail and deal-detail.\n\nActually, looking at the task description more carefully, the violation is specifically about the TaskCardList component showing the role next to the assignee name. The test entry says:\n> Given the user is on /tasks, each task card displays the assignee's avatar image (or initials fallback) and their name followed by role in parentheses (e.g., \"Sarah J. \n\nSo this is specifically about the task list on the /tasks page, which uses TaskCardList.

This is a seeding issue where the seed data references a column that doesn't exist yet when the schema is freshly created on an ephemeral branch.\n\nLooking at the schema, the `timeline_events` table does have `created_by_user_id` in its CREATE TABLE statement (line 225 of schema.ts). But the error says the column doesn't exist. This could be because the ephemeral branch is created from the main Neon branch which might have an older schema, and the `initSchema` adds new columns only with `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` — but there's no ALTER TABLE for `created_by_user_id` in the Phase 2 section.\n\n\nThe issue is that the CREATE TABLE statement won't execute if the table already exists from the main branch, so the `created_by_user_id` column never gets added. The Phase 2 migrations only handle a couple of other columns but not this one, which is why the seed data fails when it tries to reference a column that was never created. I see the schema is missing the `created_by_user_id` column on the timeline_events table, which is causing the test to fail during seeding. While this is a pre-existing issue unrelated to my assigned changes, I need to fix it to unblock test execution and verify my changes don't break anything else.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1505,"cache_read_input_tokens":79281,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1505,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6a1f517a-15b0-4062-b01a-12f0190a58f4","uuid":"b9ec3ba2-ce02-4b44-9d6b-824251f2225c"}
