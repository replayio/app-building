There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"adaef62f-bc54-4fe2-ae8b-890f8ac9c29d","uuid":"e0bf6749-ffc8-403c-a401-73d65461fe2b","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01XqahSWHBuvjWNMchdoLhsn","session_id":"adaef62f-bc54-4fe2-ae8b-890f8ac9c29d","uuid":"8c142ba4-4265-46fa-b4d2-b808d676b2e0"}

The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly.

Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"adaef62f-bc54-4fe2-ae8b-890f8ac9c29d","uuid":"d6863202-b036-4bc2-9156-623330285eb0","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-size: 14px;\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex / Value         |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —                   |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.05)` | ~5% warm black     |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(234, 231, 226)`     | `#eae7e2`          |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(242, 240, 236)`     | `#f2f0ec`          |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(230, 237, 232)`     | `#e6ede8`          |\n\nSelected row uses a very faint green tint to reinforce the accent color without being loud.\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: 4px;\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px 8px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(55, 52, 46);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background           | Description                  |\n|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| Default | transparent          | No background                |\n| Hover   | rgb(235, 233, 228)   | `#ebe9e4` — warm subtle gray |\n| Active  | rgb(226, 224, 218)   | `#e2e0da` — slightly deeper  |\n\n### Active Nav Item (current page)\n\n```css\nbackground: rgb(226, 234, 229);  /* very faint green tint */\ncolor: rgb(38, 35, 30);\nfont-weight: 500;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#ddd9d3` — a warm gray rather than cool.\nHover border darkens to approximately `#c5c0b8`.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value | Usage                     |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| 4px   | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px   | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px   | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%   | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                    |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.08) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(40, 35, 25, 0.15) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows use a warm-tinted black rather than pure black, keeping the overall palette cohesive.\n\n---\n\n## Transitions\n\n| Property         | Duration | Easing   | Usage                    |\n|------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|\n| background-color | 0.1s     | ease     | Fast hover interactions  |\n| opacity          | 0.2s     | ease-out | Standard fade-in/out     |\n| color            | 0.15s    | ease     | Text color shifts        |\n| fill             | 0.4s     | ease     | Icon color transitions   |\n\n---\n\n## CSS Custom Properties\n\n### Backgrounds & Colors\n`--bg-color`, `--bg-sidebar-color`, `--bg-base-color`, `--bg-border-color`, `--content-color-light`, `--content-highlight-color-light`\n\n### Interactive States\n`--normal-bg`, `--normal-border`, `--normal-border-hover`, `--normal-text`\n\n### Accent\n`--accent-primary: #4d7c5e`, `--accent-light: #5a8f6a`, `--accent-dark: #3e694e`, `--accent-muted: #6b8f7a`, `--accent-subtle-bg: #e6ede8`\n\n### Sizing\n`--sidebar-width` (240px), `--scrollbar-width` (12px), `--control-border-radius` (4px)\n\n---\n\n## Status Colors\n\nFor data-driven UIs that need status indicators (e.g., pipeline stages, priority levels):\n\n| Status     | Color     | Hex       | Notes                     |\n|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Success    | Forest    | `#4d7c5e` | Matches primary accent    |\n| Warning    | Amber     | `#b08a3e` | Warm gold, not bright yellow |\n| Error      | Brick     | `#b05050` | Muted red, not alarming   |\n| Info       | Slate     | `#5a7a8a` | Cool blue-gray            |\n| Neutral    | Stone     | `#8a8580` | Warm gray                 |\n\nAll status colors are desaturated to fit the subdued palette. Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}
