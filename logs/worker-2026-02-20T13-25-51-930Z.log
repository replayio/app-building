Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   185→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   186→\n   187→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   188→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   189→\n   190→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   191→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   192→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   193→\n   194→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   195→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   196→\n   197→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   198→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   199→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   200→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   201→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   202→\n   203→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   204→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   205→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   206→\n   207→## Tips\n   208→\n   209→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   210→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   211→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   212→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   213→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   214→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   215→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   216→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   217→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   218→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   219→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   220→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   221→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   222→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   223→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   224→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   225→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   226→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   227→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   228→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   229→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   230→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   231→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   232→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   233→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   234→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   235→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   236→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   237→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   238→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   239→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   240→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   241→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   242→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   243→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   244→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   245→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   246→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   247→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   248→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   249→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   250→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_014ThcHPYREwDbZHVPUvZaYf","session_id":"1e2fbde9-83a4-48b3-88a9-96d2e29f2977","uuid":"c6446723-4aa7-43b2-8713-3aeef4f4699b"}

Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory.

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n    96→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n    97→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n    98→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n    99→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   100→  being unmodified.\n   101→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests.

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    80→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    81→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_014ThcHPYREwDbZHVPUvZaYf","session_id":"1e2fbde9-83a4-48b3-88a9-96d2e29f2977","uuid":"2cadefbf-4e7e-428a-a61d-88ab14946624"}

Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_014ThcHPYREwDbZHVPUvZaYf","session_id":"1e2fbde9-83a4-48b3-88a9-96d2e29f2977","uuid":"4fd90f15-ada1-4d33-a368-142203e19203"}

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n    96→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n    97→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n    98→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n    99→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   100→  being unmodified.\n   101→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests.

Do not guess test IDs.\n   109→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   110→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   111→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   112→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   113→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   114→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   115→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   116→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1e2fbde9-83a4-48b3-88a9-96d2e29f2977","uuid":"32441fc8-8ab7-4b35-a828-df6e01b4e7ac","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write tests job into groups using `add-group`.

Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":116,"startLine":1,"totalLines":116}}}

Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   185→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   186→\n   187→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   188→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   189→\n   190→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   191→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   192→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   193→\n   194→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   195→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   196→\n   197→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   198→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   199→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   200→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   201→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   202→\n   203→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   204→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   205→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   206→\n   207→## Tips\n   208→\n   209→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   210→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   211→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   212→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   213→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   214→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   215→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   216→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   217→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   218→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   219→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   220→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   221→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   222→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   223→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   224→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   225→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   226→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   227→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   228→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   229→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   230→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   231→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   232→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   233→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   234→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   235→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   236→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   237→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   238→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   239→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   240→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   241→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   242→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   243→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   244→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   245→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   246→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   247→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   248→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   249→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   250→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1e2fbde9-83a4-48b3-88a9-96d2e29f2977","uuid":"97d52f75-270c-46cc-8093-ab9004881a97","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial testing job into a single group:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a group to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":250,"startLine":1,"totalLines":250}}}

It appears it clicked the toggle (step 10), but then couldn't verify the next assertion. Let me check what happened after the click. The test does:\n\n1. Click toggle to disable\n2. `await expect(toggle).not.toBeChecked();` — this probably timed out\n\nThe issue is likely that after clicking the toggle, the page reloads the webhooks (via `loadWebhooks()`), which causes the DOM to re-render. The locator might be stale or the toggle might be in a different state during the reload.\n\nLet me check - when we click the toggle, `handleToggleWebhook` is called which does a PUT and then calls `loadWebhooks()`. This means the entire webhook list is re-fetched and re-rendered, which could change the webhook IDs (since they come from the database). After the re-render, the locators should still work since we're using `hasText` filter.\n\n\nThe problem is that the toggle locator was captured before the re-render, and even though Playwright locators are lazy, the parent webhook item might have been replaced entirely in the DOM, making the reference invalid.\n\nLet me use Replay to dig into what actually happened during that test execution.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":946,"cache_read_input_tokens":91542,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":946,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1e2fbde9-83a4-48b3-88a9-96d2e29f2977","uuid":"e168d860-af77-408b-916e-cd82b3da4ac3"}

That means clicking the toggle didn't trigger the onChange handler. Let me look at the toggle element more closely. \n\nLooking at the WebhookSection component:\n```jsx\n<label className=\"relative inline-flex items-center cursor-pointer\">\n  <input\n    type=\"checkbox\"\n    data-testid={`webhook-toggle-${webhook.id}`}\n    checked={webhook.enabled}\n    onChange={() => onToggle(webhook.id, !webhook.enabled)}\n    className=\"sr-only peer\"\n  />\n  <div className=\"w-9 h-5 bg-gray-300 peer-checked:bg-accent rounded-full transition-colors duration-200 after:content-[''] after:absolute after:top-0.5 after:left-[2px] after:bg-white after:rounded-full after:h-4 after:w-4 after:transition-all peer-checked:after:translate-x-full\" />\n\n\n</label>\n```\n\nI'm creating a styled toggle switch where the actual checkbox input is hidden with `sr-only` and the visual toggle is a styled div that uses CSS peer selectors. The problem is that Playwright's click on the hidden input might not properly trigger the onChange event since the element is visually hidden.\n\nLooking at the test output, step 9 confirms the toggle is checked, but step 10 clicks it and then the next assertion times out waiting for it to become unchecked. The click completes at 3665ms but the state doesn't actually change — the hidden input might not be firing its onChange handler properly when clicked through Playwright, or there's a race condition where the UI hasn't updated yet. toggle appears to change momentarily but then gets reset when the webhook list is reloaded. The `sr-only` CSS hides the input visually, so even though Playwright's click completed, the actual interaction didn't register—the visible toggle div is a sibling, not the input itself. I should either move the test ID to the label and click that, use `force: true` to bypass visibility checks, or try Playwright's `.check()` and `.uncheck()` methods which might handle this better. methods for checkboxes. Let me try that approach. Actually the issue is that `click()` on a hidden input might dispatch the click event at coordinates that don't actually reach the input. Let me try clicking the label instead.\n\nLooking at this more carefully, the data-testid is on the `<input>` which is `sr-only`. When Playwright clicks it, it tries to click the center of the element, which is a 1x1 pixel area that's been clipped. The click might land outside the element.\n\nI could fix this by moving the data-testid to the `<label>` wrapper so clicking targets the visible toggle, using `.check()` and `.uncheck()` instead of `.click()`, or adding `{ force: true }` to click through visibility. The most semantically correct approach would be using the checkbox methods, but those also check visibility. Really, the right solution is to click the label since that wraps both the hidden input and the visible toggle track.

But I'm creating new locators inside the `.toPass()` block. This should be fine since I'm not iterating over dynamic elements.\n\nActually wait - the directive says the `.toPass()` body should be free of Playwright auto-waiting calls. \n\nThe `expect(input).not.toBeChecked()` is an auto-waiting assertion, and if the DOM re-renders while the element is checked, the locator could hang waiting for the assertion to pass. Since `.toPass()` retries the entire block, fresh locators get created each time, but the auto-wait timeout could still cause issues if the element state doesn't change quickly enough.\n\nThe real problem is that there's no optimistic update—the checkbox stays checked until the PUT request completes and `loadWebhooks()` re-fetches the data. So after clicking the toggle, the element won't actually change state until the async operation finishes. the label:\n1. The click toggles the checkbox locally (browser behavior - clicking a label toggles its associated input)\n2. But the `onChange` handler fires, calling `handleToggleWebhook`\n3. The PUT request is sent\n4. After the PUT succeeds, `loadWebhooks()` is called\n5. The new data arrives and React re-renders with `enabled: false`\n\nWait, but the checkbox is `checked={webhook.enabled}` which is controlled. So when the user clicks the label, the browser will try to toggle the checkbox, but React will prevent it (since it's controlled). The visual state won't change until `setWebhooks` is called with the new data.\n\nSo the flow after clicking is:\n1. Click → onChange fires → handleToggleWebhook called\n2. PUT to API\n3. loadWebhooks() → GET from API\n4. setWebhooks(new data) → re-render with enabled=false\n\nSince the checkbox only updates after the full roundtrip, I can rely on the auto-retry behavior of `expect(input).not.toBeChecked()` without needing `.toPass()`. The locators are lazy and will re-evaluate as the DOM updates, so even if the webhook item gets a new element after React re-renders, the chain from `webhookItem` through `toggleLabel` to `input` will still work correctly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1704,"cache_read_in
