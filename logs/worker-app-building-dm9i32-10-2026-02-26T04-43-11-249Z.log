You will build and/or maintain one or more\n     4→web apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n     5→\n     6→Key directories:\n     7→\n     8→* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n     9→* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n    10→* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n    24→3.

For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically.

The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    67→\n    68→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n    69→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions.

Netlify functions should be focused\n   103→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   104→frontend components.\n   105→\n   106→## Quality Gates\n   107→\n   108→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`).

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01KKVjhqPszTk7ZEDn7dR2dD","session_id":"6a69580e-5ccb-46a0-8d79-feb513e26bdf","uuid":"32e6e852-11d1-4176-9cac-87d5e4849b53"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data.

Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips).

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01KKVjhqPszTk7ZEDn7dR2dD","session_id":"6a69580e-5ccb-46a0-8d79-feb513e26bdf","uuid":"b49ac0af-c6c5-48fe-920b-440cf508e8e6"}

I now have all the information needed. Let me compile my findings into a comprehensive report.\n\n## COMPREHENSIVE EXPLORATION REPORT\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the repository, here are my findings:\n\n### 1. IDENTIFIED APP: ProductionHub\n\nThe working app is **ProductionHub**, located at `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/`. This is the primary app being worked on in the current git branch (`reference-apps-1`).\n\n### 2. FULL CONTENTS OF REQUIRED FILES\n\n#### A. `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md` (1254 lines)\n\nThis is the complete Test Specification for ProductionHub. It contains detailed test entries organized by page and component:\n\n**Pages covered:**\n- RecipesPage (/recipes) - Components: RecipesHeader, RecipesTable, RecipeDetailsPanel\n- CalendarPage (/calendar) - Components: CalendarHeader, CalendarGrid, RunDetailsPopup  \n- RunDetailsPage (/runs/:runId) - Components: RunHeader, RunActions, RawMaterialsTable, ForecastTable, RunEquipmentTable, ExternalAppLinks\n- RecipeDetailsPage (/recipe/:recipeId) - Components: RecipeDetailHeader, DescriptionCard, ProductsOutputTable, RawMaterialsCard, EquipmentRequiredList\n- EquipmentPage (/equipment) - Components: EquipmentHeader, EquipmentTable\n- EquipmentDetailsPage (/equipment/:id) - Components: EquipmentDetailHeader, EquipmentInfo, MaintenanceNotes\n\nThe file contains over 300 test entries (BDD-formatted with Given/When/Then) covering all interactive elements, navigation, state changes, and visual styling requirements.\n\n**Full content is available at:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md` (1254 lines total)\n\n---\n\n#### B. `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md` (82 lines)\n\n**Full content:**\n```markdown\n# Skill\n\nYou are writing a complete, detailed test specification for an app based on an initial app specification\nin `AppSpec.md`. If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n```\n\n---\n\n#### C. `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md` (156 lines)\n\n**Full content:**\n```markdown\n# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide. If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n```\n\n---\n\n#### D. `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md` (165 lines)\n\n**Full content:**\n```markdown\n# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`. Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3.

IDENTIFIED APP: ProductionHub\n\nThe working app is **ProductionHub**, located at `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/`. This is the primary app being worked on in the current git branch (`reference-apps-1`).\n\n### 2. FULL CONTENTS OF REQUIRED FILES\n\n#### A. `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md` (1254 lines)\n\nThis is the complete Test Specification for ProductionHub. It contains detailed test entries organized by page and component:\n\n**Pages covered:**\n- RecipesPage (/recipes) - Components: RecipesHeader, RecipesTable, RecipeDetailsPanel\n- CalendarPage (/calendar) - Components: CalendarHeader, CalendarGrid, RunDetailsPopup  \n- RunDetailsPage (/runs/:runId) - Components: RunHeader, RunActions, RawMaterialsTable, ForecastTable, RunEquipmentTable, ExternalAppLinks\n- RecipeDetailsPage (/recipe/:recipeId) - Components: RecipeDetailHeader, DescriptionCard, ProductsOutputTable, RawMaterialsCard, EquipmentRequiredList\n- EquipmentPage (/equipment) - Components: EquipmentHeader, EquipmentTable\n- EquipmentDetailsPage (/equipment/:id) - Components: EquipmentDetailHeader, EquipmentInfo, MaintenanceNotes\n\nThe file contains over 300 test entries (BDD-formatted with Given/When/Then) covering all interactive elements, navigation, state changes, and visual styling requirements.\n\n**Full content is available at:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md` (1254 lines total)\n\n---\n\n#### B. `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md` (82 lines)\n\n**Full content:**\n```markdown\n# Skill\n\nYou are writing a complete, detailed test specification for an app based on an initial app specification\nin `AppSpec.md`. If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n```\n\n---\n\n#### C. `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md` (156 lines)\n\n**Full content:**\n```markdown\n# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide. If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n```\n\n---\n\n#### D. `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md` (165 lines)\n\n**Full content:**\n```markdown\n# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`. Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Let me systematically go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecDashboardPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in DashboardPage test entries\n\nI need to check the DashboardPage test entries in docs/tests.md against the testSpec.md directives.\n\nLet me re-read the testSpec.md directives:\n\n1. **Images consistency**: Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element**: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n\n3. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements**: I need to ensure that test entries don't swap out complex columns or filters for simpler alternatives just because they're easier to build — if the mockup shows four filters, all four must be tested, and if columns require joins or computed values, those must be included.\n\n4. **Exact navigation target or action result**: Every clickable element needs a specific navigation destination or action result documented, not vague or ambiguous outcomes.\n\n5. **Data mutation + side effects**: I need to check that test entries account for any data changes and side effects triggered by user actions.\n\n6. **Button and control appearance matters**: Specific text, icons, and styling shown in the mockup should be verified in tests.\n\n7. **Modal dialogs**: These need complete testing to ensure they function properly.\n\n8. **Attachment functionality should support file uploads**: Unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n\n9. **Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format**.\n\n10. **Backend integrations** must include complete setup instructions.\n\n11. **State-changing actions** must have tests that verify other parts of the app update appropriately.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the DashboardPage test entries, starting with the QuickActions section. The Add New Supplier Button entry correctly specifies the person-plus icon appearance.\n\nLooking at the remaining entries: the Create Purchase Order Button test covers its document icon, the Add New Supplier Button test verifies the modal opens with all fields and defaults, and the Create Supplier test checks that saving updates the dashboard. That persistence test is borderline—it confirms the data reaches the backend and displays on the dashboard, which likely satisfies the requirement even if it doesn't explicitly test a page reload. The Cancel button test appears to be cut off. Supplier** - ✅ Good.\n- **Create Supplier Dialog Validation** - ✅ Good.\n- **Create Purchase Order Button Opens Create Order Dialog** - Tests modal opens with fields, defaults. ✅ Good. Has Supplier dropdown, order date (defaults to today), expected delivery, and line item section with SKU, Item Name/Description, Qty, Unit Price. Good.\n- **Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard** - Tests the full save flow. ✅ But directive 5: \"write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur\". The test verifies it appears in the table but doesn't check persistence. However, showing up in the table after being saved to the backend is reasonable evidence of persistence.\n- **Create Order Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Order** - ✅ Good.\n- **Create Order Dialog Validation** - ✅ Good.\n\nNow moving into the UpcomingOrdersTable section, I'm checking that the heading displays, the table renders with all the right columns (Order Id, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, Total Cost), and the order data rows show all 5 orders with their values. The Order ID links navigate correctly to the detail page and are styled as blue underlined links, while status badges display with appropriate color coding. I'm also verifying the filter by status dropdown works and clears properly, and checking the filter by supplier functionality. I've verified the supplier card fields are all accounted for—name, status badge, contact details, and order summary—and the navigation to individual supplier pages works correctly. Now I should cross-reference the mockup image to make sure I haven't missed anything in the test specifications.\n\nLooking at the AppSpec, the dashboard covers quick actions, upcoming orders, and the suppliers list, but I'm noticing a potential discrepancy with the button icon placements—the \"Add New Supplier\" button should have the person-plus icon on the left, while the \"Create Purchase Order\" button has its document icon positioned on the right, which might be referring to the overall layout rather than the icon's position within the button itself.\n\nFor the Create Order dialog, there's a gap in test coverage for adding and removing multiple line items, even though the dialog supports these interactions. The directives specify that every clickable element needs a test entry with the exact action result, so I should verify whether the mockup actually displays the \"Add Item\" and \"Remove Item\" buttons or if the test spec is only covering the basic flow.\n\nNow I'm going through the modal dialog directive systematically. The Add New Supplier modal covers opening, field presence, defaults, saving, canceling, and validation, but I notice the close button via the X icon isn't explicitly tested as its own entry—though the cancel test might implicitly cover that behavior.\n\nFor the Create Purchase Order modal, I'm seeing the same coverage for basic modal operations, but there's a gap: the add and remove line item buttons inside the modal aren't being tested as interactive elements, which seems like it should be part of \"completely\" testing the modal's functionality.\n\nNow looking at the persistence directive—Create Supplier and Create Order both verify that the new data appears after saving, which demonstrates persistence. But I need to check if there are other mutations being tested that don't have this verification. the test verifies it shows up in the UpcomingOrdersTable. ✅. Now I'm checking the clickable elements against the directive that requires specifying exact navigation targets or action results. Most elements are covered — the buttons open modals, the ID links and cards navigate to their respective detail pages, filters work as expected, and modal controls are specified. But I notice the Add Item button within the Create Order modal doesn't have a corresponding test entry yet.\n\nLooking at the Remove Item button too, that's also missing from the test entries. So there's a gap here with the line item management in the modal not being fully tested. Let me systematically go through each directive in testSpec.md against the DashboardPage test entries to make sure I'm not missing anything else. is a necessary UI feature for creating multiple line items in a purchase order, so it should be tested even though the spec doesn't explicitly mention an \"Add Item\" button. The test entry needs to cover this interaction.\n\nLooking through the spec directives now: the line item add/remove functionality isn't explicitly described in the spec since it only mentions an \"initial line item section,\" so that's acceptable to leave out of the test entries. For data mutations, I'm verifying that creating a supplier shows up on the dashboard and creating an order appears in the table with proper side effects. The visual requirements like button icons (person-plus for Add New Supplier, document for Create Purchase Order), color-coded status badges, and blue underlined order ID links are all specified in the test entries. Both modals are thoroughly tested for opening, field presence, defaults, saving, canceling, and validation.\n\nAttachment uploads and import/export dialogs don't apply to the DashboardPage, so those are covered. For state-changing actions, I've verified that supplier and order creation properly update their respective UI sections. Let me reconsider directive 11 more carefully though—it's asking whether mutations trigger updates in other parts of the app, and I'm realizing the spec might be hinting at something more comprehensive that I should double-check. I should verify this against the mockup to be thorough. Looking at the Create Order modal more carefully, I notice there's no test coverage for the \"Add Item\" and remove buttons that let users modify line items—these are interactive elements that should be tested to fully validate the modal's functionality. I need to determine whether these interactions are part of the specification or just implementation details. I'm getting caught up in whether the test spec should cover implementation details like the Add/Remove buttons.

[2026-02-26T04:39:54.343Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01QeHSKs1d6zMtWH4wy73dex","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup. Let me compare it against the test entries:\n\nFrom the mockup:\n1. **Navigation bar** - Shows app logo (cube icon), \"Dashboard\" nav link with home icon. The top-right has a user profile icon with a dropdown chevron.\n2. **Quick Actions section** - \"Quick Actions\" heading, \"Add New Supplier\" button with person-plus icon, \"Create Purchase Order\" button with document icon.\n3. **Upcoming Orders section** - \"Upcoming Orders\" heading, two filter dropdowns (\"Filter\" and \"Filter Filter\"), table with columns: Order Id, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, Total Cost. 5 rows of data.\n\n\n4. **Suppliers List section** - \"Suppliers List\" heading, grid of supplier cards (4 per row), each card shows: supplier name, status badge, contact name, email, and orders summary.\n\nNow I'm checking the test spec against what's visible in the mockup. The navigation bar mentions Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders, and Inventory as nav links, but the mockup only shows Dashboard visible—the other links might be hidden off-screen or the mockup is showing a simplified view.\n\nFor the Quick Actions section, the mockup displays it as a heading but the test spec doesn't have a dedicated test entry for that heading itself. The directive emphasizes inventorying every visible element, and other sections like Upcoming Orders and Suppliers List do have heading tests, so I should check whether Quick Actions needs one too. Looking at the QuickActions component code, there's no heading rendered even though the mockup displays \"Quick Actions\" as a heading—this is a gap that needs both a code fix and a corresponding test entry to match the pattern used for other sections. The filter dropdown tests for Upcoming Orders appear comprehensive, and the supplier card tests cover the essential display elements like name, status badge, and contact information.\n\nThe Order ID column styling as blue clickable links is already covered in the tests. Now I'm reconsidering whether the missing \"Quick Actions\" heading warrants flagging—the directive explicitly requires testing every visible element including section headings, so this should be included in the test spec. Looking at the QuickActions component code, there's no heading being rendered, but the mockup clearly shows \"Quick Actions\" as a section title. This means the test spec is missing an entry to verify this heading exists—that's a testSpec directive violation—and the component itself needs to implement it, which is a writeApp violation. I'm verifying the table columns match between the mockup and test spec—Order Id, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, Total Cost all check out. Looking at the filter dropdowns and status badges in the mockup to see if there are any other gaps in the test coverage.\n\nThe only missing piece I can identify is a test entry for the \"Quick Actions\" heading, which appears in the mockup but isn't explicitly tested. Now I'm moving on to check whether the DashboardPage components themselves satisfy the test requirements outlined in the spec.\n\nLooking at the writeApp.md directives that apply here: I need to verify each component meets its test entries, that visual elements match the mockup, and that interactive elements have proper `data-testid` attributes for E2E testing. The other directives about npm processes, database handling, and backend concerns don't directly apply to the component code itself.\n\nChecking the modal and table components: the Create Order modal correctly uses SearchableSelect for the Supplier field instead of a plain text input, the UpcomingOrdersTable uses a custom FilterSelect component rather than native HTML select elements, and the AddSupplierModal has a custom dropdown for status. All the key interactive elements appear to be covered properly.\n\nNow I'm verifying the styling guidelines across the page components. DashboardPage has the correct padding classes applied to its root element, and I need to check whether any containers are using overflow hidden with absolute-positioned children, plus ensure that individual components aren't adding their own outer padding when they shouldn't be.\n\nLooking at QuickActions more closely, the component has proper test IDs on the action buttons and modals, uses custom dropdowns and searchable selects instead of native elements, but I notice it's missing a \"Quick Actions\" heading. I should also cross-reference each test specification entry against the actual component implementation to verify everything required is present—like confirming the Add New Supplier and Create Purchase Order buttons both exist with their icons and labels. and text. ✅\n- \"Add New Supplier Button Opens Create Supplier Dialog\" - Modal has title \"Add New Supplier\", all fields (name, address, contact name, phone, email, description, status), status defaults to \"Active\". ✅\n- \"Create Supplier via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" - Save handler calls createSupplier and fetchSuppliers, closes modal. ✅\n- \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\" - Cancel button calls onClose. ✅\n- \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" - Validates name is required. ✅\n- \"Create Purchase Order Button Opens Create Order Dialog\" - Modal has title \"Create Purchase Order\", fields for Supplier (SearchableSelect), Order Date (defaults today), Expected Delivery, line items. ✅\n- \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" - Save handler creates order and refreshes the list. ✅\n- \"Create Order Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Order\" - Cancel calls onClose. ✅\n- \"Create Order Dialog Validation\" - Validates supplier is required. ✅\n\nNow checking the UpcomingOrdersTable tests: the heading displays correctly, the table renders with the right columns (Order Id, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, Total Cost), order data populates the rows, and Order IDs function as navigation links to the order details page with proper styling applied. I'm verifying the SuppliersList component tests are passing—checking that the grid layout displays correctly, each card shows the supplier name, status badge, contact details, and order summary, and that clicking a card navigates to the supplier details page.\n\nNow I need to review the CSS to ensure the grid is actually rendering four columns per row as the mockup shows, and I'm also noticing that the \"Quick Actions\" section heading appears in the mockup but seems to be missing from the component implementation. Let me examine the layout structure to see if there are any other visual discrepancies between what's built and what was

The QuickActions component doesn't render this heading. ❌ VIOLATION.\n\n2. **data-testid attributes**: Let me check all interactive elements:\n   - DashboardPage: `data-testid=\"dashboard-page\"` ✅\n   - QuickActions container: `data-testid=\"quick-actions\"` ✅\n   - Add Supplier button: `data-testid=\"quick-action-add-supplier\"` ✅\n   - Create Order button: `data-testid=\"quick-action-create-order\"` ✅\n   - Add Supplier Modal: `data-testid=\"add-supplier-modal\"` ✅\n   - All form fields have data-testids ✅\n   - Create Order Modal: `data-testid=\"create-order-modal\"` ✅\n   - All line item fields have data-testids ✅\n   - UpcomingOrdersTable container: `data-testid=\"upcoming-orders\"` ✅\n   - Heading: `data-testid=\"upcoming-orders-heading\"` ✅\n   - Table rows and cells are properly labeled ✅\n   - Order links, status badges, and filter selects all have their test identifiers in place ✅\n   - Empty state variants covered with distinct test IDs ✅\n   - SuppliersList section is set up with container and heading test IDs ✅\n   - Suppliers grid, individual cards, and all their sub-elements (name, status, contact info, email, order count) have comprehensive test coverage ✅\n   - Empty suppliers state also accounted for ✅\n\nThe data-testid coverage looks complete across all components.\n\nNow checking for native HTML select elements—none found, which is good. Moving on to layout concerns: I'm noticing that QuickActions and UpcomingOrdersTable both have margin-bottom applied to their root elements, which violates the principle that components should be layout-agnostic and let parent layouts handle spacing. These need to be refactored to remove that outer margin.\n\nWait, I should double-check whether this is actually a directive or just a tip in the documentation. Let me look at what's explicitly listed under the Directives section versus what's in Tips—that distinction matters for how strictly I need to enforce it. I'm realizing I need to distinguish between Directives and Tips—the skill specifically asks me to check for violations of Directives only, not Tips. So \"layout-agnostic components\" doesn't apply here. Looking at the actual Directives, I can see that the visual mockup check is failing because the Quick Actions heading is missing, while the test entries and data-testid attributes appear to be in order. The QuickActions component is missing the \"Quick Actions\" heading that appears in the mockup, which violates the visual appearance directive. Looking at the test specifications, the button icons and layout match what's expected—the person-plus icon is on the left of the first button and the document icon is on the second button in the flex row—but I need to examine this test entry more closely.\n\nThe phrase \"on the right side\" in the spec is ambiguous: it could mean the icon position within the button or the button's position relative to the other button. Checking against the mockup clarifies that both button icons are actually on the left, and the Create Purchase Order button sits to the right of the Add New Supplier button, which matches the current code implementation. Now I'm verifying the visual styling details like button size, rounded corners, and background color against the mockup.\n\nChecking the UpcomingOrdersTable styling next—the section card layout, filter dropdowns, status badge colors, and order ID link styling all appear to align with the code, though I need to confirm that the accent color variable is rendering as the blue shown in the mockup.\n\nThe SuppliersList grid is set to 4 columns per row with all the required card elements present. Now I'm verifying the overflow constraint—specifically whether the modal-content has overflow hidden while containing the absolutely-positioned dropdown menu, which would violate the directive. Looking at the violations I've found so far, the main issues are the missing \"Quick Actions\" heading in both the component and its tests, which doesn't match the mockup. I need to verify whether this heading is actually supposed to be there by examining the mockup more carefully. Now I'm checking the writeTests.md directives for the DashboardPage tests. The key requirements are that tests must verify navigation targets precisely rather than just checking for click handlers, interact with components on each page they appear on without using page.goto() to navigate back, assert both primary and side effects for actions that produce them, and use getByTestId instead of getByText() for precise targeting to avoid matching substrings in other elements. I'm checking the auth requirements—login and email verification aren't relevant for DashboardPage tests. Now I'm moving through the parallel test design directives: tests run independently with separate databases, so I need to avoid hardcoded IDs and fixed counts, creating records in setup hooks instead. The config uses fully parallel execution with Replay Chromium and a 60-second timeout minimum. Looking at dashboard-quick-actions.spec.ts, the beforeEach navigates to the dashboard and waits for it to load without extra cleanup.\n\nThe first few tests use getByTestId to verify button visibility and text. The \"Create Supplier via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" test chains multiple user flows so it's marked as slow, uses getByTestId for form fields, and filters locators by text for the supplier card with generous timeouts. The cancel test counts existing supplier cards before the action to verify nothing was created. Dialog Validation\", I need to check if it's verifying navigation targets precisely after clicking to create a supplier.\n\nLooking at the supplier list tests, the grid layout assertion uses a \"greater than or equal to\" check rather than a fixed count, which is reasonable for seed data. The supplier card test uses `.first()` to grab the first matching card when filtering by name, which could be problematic if multiple suppliers share the same name — I should verify whether the directive about avoiding `.first()` applies here or if the test ID prefix makes it specific enough. The count assertions are checking for specific seed data values, and since these tests run in isolated workers across different spec files, there's no risk of other tests affecting the supplier counts within this particular file. But wait, the \"Multiple Supplier Cards Displayed\" test uses `toHaveCount(2)` for Apex Logistics, which is an exact count. If some other test in the same spec file (same worker) had created an additional Apex Logistics supplier, this would fail. But looking at the tests in this file, none create new suppliers. The only concern is if seed data changes. This is a somewhat fragile assertion but not strictly a violation since no tests in this file mutate data.\n\nActually, the parallel test design directive says \"Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count.\" This test doesn't create/modify/delete records - it just reads. But it asserts specific counts from seed data. The directive specifically targets tests that \"create, modify, or delete records\". Reading tests asserting on seed data is acceptable. ✅\n\nThe empty state test uses route interception to simulate no suppliers, which is clean. ✅\n\nMoving to the dashboard-upcoming-orders spec, the beforeEach doesn't have unnecessary cleanup. The order data test asserts on known seed IDs rather than hardcoded database values. ✅ Navigation is verified by checking the URL pattern after clicking an order link. ✅ For the styling test, I'm checking that the order ID has the right class and computed styles applied.\n\nThe filter tests check that applying status or supplier filters correctly shows/hides rows. When both filters are applied together, the test verifies the intersection of results.\n\nI'm also verifying the empty state scenarios—when no orders match the filters and when there are no upcoming orders at all. The currency and date formatting tests confirm those columns display values correctly.\n\nScanning through all the test files for `getByText()` calls, I don't see any—everything uses `getByTestId()`, `locator()`, or `.filter({ hasText: })` instead. And I'm not finding any `.toPass()` blocks either, so that directive is satisfied as well.\n\nThe beforeEach hooks are clean with just navigation and element waits, no unnecessary cleanup. Most assertions have the 30-second timeout for backend operations, and the multi-step dialog tests are marked with `test.slow()`.\n\nNow I'm compiling the violations found across all three test files to see what needs fixing.\n\nI've identified two related issues: the mockup shows a \"Quick Actions\" heading that's missing from both the test spec and the actual component implementation. This is a single root cause affecting both the test coverage and the visual output, so I should address it as one fix task rather than two separate ones.\n\nNow I'm double-checking whether the badge styling for supplier statuses is properly defined in the CSS, and I'm also doing a final scan of the mockup to make sure I haven't overlooked any other elements that should be tested or implemented.\n\nLooking more carefully at the Quick Actions section, it seems like it should have its own card container with a heading, similar to how Upcoming Orders is structured, but the current code just renders the buttons in a flex container without that wrapper—there's a visual inconsistency between the mockup and the implementation that I need to be careful about.\n\nNow I'm going to systematically work through my findings: first I'll review each test entry and flag violations, then check each component and file, then examine the test files themselves. The main issue I've identified is the missing Quick Actions heading, which appears to be a single root cause affecting both the test spec and the component code.
