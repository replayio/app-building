Both files have conflict markers:\n\n1. `apps/todo-app/docs/tests.md` - Has conflict markers between two versions of the test specification. The `origin/main` (theirs) version is more comprehensive with more tests (like persistence tests, count updates on add/delete). I need to merge these intelligently.\n\n2. `tasks/tasks-app-building-cps77p.json` and `tasks/tasks-app-building-bydkxh.json` - The task files have conflicts too.\n\nLet me now read the task files to understand their state.\n\nFor `tests.md`, I need to resolve by taking the best of both. \n\nLooking at the test sections, the `origin/main` version appears more complete with additional test cases. I should compare what each side covers and merge them to include all the important test scenarios without duplication. Looking at the Filters section, origin/main has additional persistence and behavior tests that HEAD is missing. Since the merge was supposed to use `--theirs` to accept origin/main, I should go with that version as the authoritative one.

Looking at what happened:\n- The HEAD version of `bydkxh.json` had the testSpec task already completed (it was at the front, and the front task was being dequeued)\n- The `origin/main` version of `bydkxh.json` still had the testSpec task with expanded subtasks\n\n\n- There was also a `cps77p.json` version with a different testSpec entry\n\nSince testSpec has already been completed and tests.md was written by the local branch, I should remove testSpec from the queue entirely and keep the remaining tasks (writeShared, writeApp, writeScript, writeTests, testing, deployment). For the tests.md file itself, I'll use the origin/main version since it's more comprehensive with additional persistence and filter tests.\n\nNow I'm realizing the origin/main task queue still has testSpec listed with completed subtasks, which means it wasn't dequeued there either. The local branch has already written the tests.md file, so the testSpec task is definitely done and should be removed from the current queue.\n\nWriting the cleaned task file...\n\nI see the conflict now—the AGENTS.md guidelines say I shouldn't directly edit task files, but resolving merge conflicts is a special case where I need to fix them. Looking at the git status, bydkxh.json is an untracked file from another worker that added the resolveConflicts task, while cps77p.json is the tracked file with the conflict markers. I need to determine which is the authoritative version based on the rename pattern in the diff.\n\nThe cps77p.json is the main task file now after the rename, so I'll clean up the conflict markers there. Since the testSpec task is already completed (tests.md exists), I should remove that entry. For tests.md itself, I need to compare the HEAD and origin/main versions to see if there's anything unique in the local version worth keeping alongside the more comprehensive origin version.\n\nLooking at the differences across the test sections, origin/main has significantly more coverage—it includes persistence tests, styling observations, and filtering behavior that HEAD doesn't have. HEAD does have a few unique tests like the empty state check and singular form count, but origin/main is more thorough overall. I'll go with the origin/main version and preserve those few unique local tests.\n\nSince the task is to accept the upstream version and only re-apply lost changes that still matter, I'll use origin/main as the base. The HEAD-only tests are nice additions, but origin/main's comprehensive coverage is what matters most for downstream test generation. Let me write out the resolved files now.","signature":"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
