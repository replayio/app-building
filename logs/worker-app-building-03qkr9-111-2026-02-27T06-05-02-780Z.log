I need to add JSX comments next to every interactive element in the three component files with the titles of the tests that exercise each element. Let me go through each file systematically.\n\nThe directive from testSpec.md says:\n> \"Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\"\n\nLet me map test titles to interactive elements for each component:\n\n### QuickActions.tsx\n\nInteractive elements and their test titles:\n\n1. **\"Add New Supplier\" button** (line 35-47):\n   - \"Display Add New Supplier Button\"\n   - \"Add New Supplier Button Opens Create Supplier Dialog\"\n\n2. **\"Create Purchase Order\" button** (line 49-61):\n   - \"Display Create Purchase Order Button\"\n   - \"Create Purchase Order Button Opens Create Order Dialog\"\n\n3. **AddSupplierModal** (shown when showSupplierModal is true):\n   - Modal overlay (line 143) - close on overlay click:\n     - \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\"\n   - Modal close button (line 147):\n     - \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\"\n   - Supplier Name input field and other form fields need to be mapped to their corresponding tests\n\n, including address, contact name, phone, email, and description fields that all validate and save the supplier when submitted.\n   - Status dropdown also needs test coverage for the dialog interaction.\n   - Cancel button should prevent creation, while the save button triggers validation and updates the dashboard.\n\nNow moving to the CreateOrderModal component, which has similar patterns with a modal overlay that closes on click, a close button, and a supplier search field that updates the dashboard when an order is created.\n\nThe remaining form fields—order date, expected delivery, and the line item details like SKU, name, quantity, and price—all tie back to the core \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" test, ensuring the modal properly captures and persists all order information.\n\nNow I'm looking at the UpcomingOrdersTable component and its filter controls for status and supplier, which have their own test coverage around filtering behavior and empty states.\n\nI also see the Order ID links that need to be tested for navigation and styling, and then moving into the SuppliersList component where the supplier cards themselves are clickable elements that navigate to details pages.\n\nI'm planning to add JSX comments next to each interactive element to mark where the tests apply, using the proper comment syntax for
