N/A ✓\n\n**Directive: Button and control appearance matters**\n- Export PDF: \"outline/secondary style\" specified ✓\n- Export CSV: \"blue/primary filled style\" specified ✓\n- View button: \"styled with a border/outline\" specified ✓\n- Expand chevron: right-pointing (▶) and downward (▼) states described ✓\n\n**Directive: Completely test modal dialogs**\nNo modals on this page.

This isn't a ReportList test per se — it's an AccountsPage NavBar test. Let me read that test quickly to check for writeTests violations.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/accounts-page.spec.ts\nThis test is in the AccountsPage spec file and tests NavBar navigation. It uses `getByTestId` (good), verifies URL after navigation (good), and uses generous timeouts (good). No writeTests directive violations here.\n\nSince there are no dedicated ReportList test files, there are no writeTests.md directive violations to report. The absence of tests is a gap, but creating tests would be a writeTests task, not a directive violation fix.\n[TodoWrite]\n## Summary\n\nAll three subtasks are complete. Here are the findings:\n\n### CheckTestSpecReportList\n**2 violations found:**\n1. **Missing NavBar active state test** — The mockup shows \"Reports\" highlighted in the NavBar, but no test verifies this (other pages like TransactionsPage have this test). Violates directive 2 (inventory every visible element).\n2. **Missing search-no-results empty state test** — No test for when search filtering produces zero results (TransactionsPage has this). \n\n→ Fix task queued: `FixViolationReportListTestSpec`\n\n### CheckComponentsReportList  \n**1 violation found:**\n1. **REPORT_TYPE_LABELS mismatch** — `ReportTable.tsx` shows types as \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", \"Budget vs Actual\" but the mockup shows \"Financial Report\" and \"Expense Detail\". Violates the directive to match visual appearance to mockup.\n\n→ Fix task queued: `FixViolationReportTypeLabelsMismatch`\n\n### CheckTestsReportList\n**No violations found** — No dedicated ReportList test files exist yet. The absence of tests is a gap (to be addressed by a writeTests task) but not a writeTests directive violation.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 399661ms | Turns: 58 | Cost: $1.9518\nCost: $1.9518 (total: $44.0898)\nTurns: 58\nTask signaled <DONE>.

Let me systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecReportList\n\nI'm checking each ReportList test entry against the testSpec.md directives.\n\n**Checking test entries against the mockup and directives:**\n\n### Directive 2: \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\"\n\n**Checking ReportListHeader entries:**\n- \"ReportListHeader displays page title\" — covers page title ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader displays breadcrumb navigation\" — covers breadcrumb ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader displays search bar with search icon\" — covers search ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader search bar filters reports by name\" — covers filter behavior ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader search bar clears and restores all reports\" — covers clear ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader displays Generate New Report button\" — covers button ✓\n- \"ReportListHeader Generate New Report button opens CreateReportDialog\" — covers button action ✓\n\n**VIOLATION FOUND**: The mockup clearly shows the NavBar with the \"Reports\" link highlighted/active. Other pages like TransactionsPage have a test \"TransactionsPageHeader NavBar Transactions link is active\". The ReportList section is **missing a NavBar active state test** for the Reports link. This ... (truncated)\n\n**Checking ReportTable entries:**\n- \"ReportTable displays correct column headers\" — lists all 6 columns matching mockup ✓\n- Sort tests (ascending/descending/toggle) — covers Report Name sorting ✓\n- \"ReportTable displays report rows with correct data\" — provides example data ✓\n- Individual column data tests (Type, Date Range, Accounts, Status) — covered ✓\n- Status badges (Complete and Pending) — covered ✓\n- Actions (refresh, download, View Details) — all three buttons covered ✓\n- Pagination tests — covered ✓\n- \"ReportTable empty state when no reports exist\" — covered ✓\n- \"ReportTable newly generated report appears in the list\" — covered ✓\n\n**POTENTIAL VIOLATION**: There's no test for search producing zero results (empty state from search), unlike TransactionsPage which has \"SearchBar no results displays empty state\". The ReportTable's empty state test only covers when no reports exist at all, not when a search query matches nothing. T...

The code's `REPORT_TYPE_LABELS` in ReportTable.tsx maps to \"Summary\", \"Detailed\", \"Budget vs Actual\" which don't match.\n- **VIOLATION**: Type labels in `ReportTable.tsx:12-16` don't match the mockup or test spec expectations.\n\n**Directive: \"data-testid on interactive elements\"** — Checking all three files:\n- ReportListPage: `data-testid=\"report-list-page\"` ✓\n- ReportListHeader: header, title, search, input, button all have testids ✓\n- ReportTable: table, header, rows, all cells, all action buttons/links, empty state have testids ✓\n- All interactive elements covered ✓\n\n**Directive: \"Match visual appearance to mockup\"** — The mockup confirms: breadcrumb, title, search, button, table columns, sort arrow, badges, action buttons match. Type labels don't match (violation noted above).\n\n**Directive: \"No native HTML `<select>` elements\"** — No `<select>` in any ReportList component ✓\n\n**Directive: \"Page root padding `p-6 max-sm:p-3`\"** — ReportListPage has `<div className=\"p-6 max-sm:p-3\">` on content wrapper ✓\n\n**Directive: \"Neon tagged template literals\"** — reports.ts backend uses tagged templates exclusively ✓\n\n**Directive: \"Empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP\"** — Backend uses `${date_range_start || null}`, `${date_range_end || null}`, `${categories_filter || null}` — uses `||` correctly ✓\n\n**Directive: \"Netlify Functions path parsing\"** — Uses regex stripping then segments[0], correct approach ✓\n\n**Directive: \"No duplicate nav links\"** — NavBar is a shared component, not specific to ReportList ✓\n\n**Directive: \"Components layout-agnostic\"** — ReportListHeader and ReportTable root elements don't have outer padding/margin ✓\n\n**Directive: \"No overflow:hidden on containers with absolutely-positioned children\"** — ReportTable wrapper uses `overflow-x: auto` (not `hidden`) ✓\n\n**Directive: \"Domain-specific colors as CSS variables\"** — Status badges use CSS vars (`badge-complete-bg`, `badge-pending-bg`) ✓\n\nThe type labels mismatch is the only writeApp directive violation found.

Locating BudgetDetailsTab component files across the repository\n6. Now I'm narrowing down to test files specifically in the Accounting app, then searching for references to BudgetDetailsTab within those tests, and looking for AccountDetail-related files to understand the component structure better.\n7. I'm checking the test directory structure and examining what budget-related components exist in the src folder.\n8. Running a typecheck and then executing the specific test file with the required environment variable set to see what's actually failing. I'm continuing to catalog the shell commands used across the repository, documenting their purposes and success rates as I work through analyzing the test files and component structure in the Accounting app and other modules. I'm now searching for AccountDetail page files and their corresponding test files, then examining the test directory structure and looking for budget-related components to understand the existing patterns before writing the new test.\n\nAfter that, I'm running the typecheck and linting to ensure the codebase is clean, then attempting to run the Playwright test for the account detail page—though it initially fails due to a missing environment variable, so I'm setting the Neon project ID and retrying the test.\n\nNow I'm going to write out the analysis files directly since I have
