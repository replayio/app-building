FixViolationTopNavBarJSXComments: Add JSX comments next to every interactive element in TopNavBar.tsx with the titles of the tests that exercise each element (testSpec.md directive). Elements: logo link, nav link items, user profile button\n\nI need to:\n1. Find the TopNavBar.tsx file\n2. Read testSpec.md to find which tests exercise each interactive element\n3. Add JSX comments next to each interactive element\n\nLet me find the relevant files first.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2761,"cache_read_input_tokens":23749,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2761,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"70e11907-384f-4bda-ab23-93f138ec6041","uuid":"4b0485f7-8e8f-4fd3-9286-45739263c752"}

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section.
