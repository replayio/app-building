Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips).

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":144,"startLine":1,"totalLines":144}}}

Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":133,"startLine":1,"totalLines":133}}}

Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't implement simpler alternatives when the mockup specifies something particular.\n4. Every clickable element needs a test entry that documents exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers.\n5. When user actions change data, I need test entries confirming the changes persist and all expected side effects occur.\n6. Button styling, text, and icons matter — if the mockup shows specific details, the test should verify them.\n7. Modal dialogs need comprehensive testing to ensure they function correctly.\n8. File uploads should be supported in attachment functionality unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs need to specify their expected behavior.\n10. Any backend integrations users can configure should have complete setup instructions visible in the UI.\n11. State-changing actions require tests verifying that other parts of the app update accordingly.\n\nNow I'm going through each test entry for TasksListPage to validate them against these requirements. Looking at TasksHeader, the entries cover the page title, button appearance, dialog opening, form validation, successful creation with persistence, cancellation, and optional deal association.\n\nFor TasksFilter, I'm checking that all the filter functionality is properly tested—the dropdown display, category options, text input, filtering by various categories like priority and assignee, empty states, and filter reset behavior.\n\nMoving through TasksList, I'm verifying that task cards display required elements and priority badges use correct color coding.\n\nTask name displays in bold, due dates show relative formatting for upcoming tasks and absolute dates for further out ones, and assignees display their avatar with abbreviated name and role. Tasks are sorted by due date with the soonest appearing first. The action menu opens with the correct options, and I'm confirming that \"View Details\" navigates to the client detail page, \"Edit\" opens the task dialog with persistent changes, and \"Mark as Complete\" updates the task while reflecting changes across related pages. The \"Delete\" action removes tasks after confirmation.\n\nThe list also shows an empty state when there are no tasks, and clicking a task card navigates to the associated client detail page. I'm now verifying that I've covered all clickable elements and their exact outcomes—the New Task button opens a dialog, filters display their options, and task names navigate to the client detail page.\n\nFor data mutations, I'm checking that creates, completions, deletions, and edits all persist and cascade through related sections like the client Tasks area and deal Linked Tasks. The modal dialogs also need full coverage: the New Task and Edit dialogs should handle opening, validation, saving, and canceling, plus the delete confirmation should test both confirming and canceling actions.\n\nI should cross-reference the AppSpec.md to see if there's anything else I'm missing from the requirements. mockups exist. Let me look for that.\n\nActually, looking more closely at all the directives, I think the test entries look quite comprehensive. Let me check for specific violations:\n\nDirective: \"State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately.\"\n- Sub-bullet: \"If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry.\"\n  - The spec doesn't mention history/timeline tracking for tasks specifically, so this may not apply.\n- Sub-bullet: \"If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships...\"\n  - Tasks are linked to clients and deals unidirectionally, so this doesn't apply.\n\nDirective: \"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g., history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\"\n- The task creation test verifies it appears in the client's Tasks section ✓\n- The deal association test verifies it appears in the deal's Linked Tasks section ✓  \n- The Mark as Complete test verifies it's reflected on the client's Tasks section and the deal ✓\n- The Delete test verifies removal from client's Tasks section and deal's Linked Tasks ✓\n\nThe test spec entries for TasksListPage look solid—I don't see any clear violations. Let me check the AppSpec more carefully to see if there's anything the tests might be missing.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the Edit test entry does test the edit flow end-to-end: opening the dialog, changing the priority field, saving, and verifying both the UI update and database persistence. That covers the directive requirement.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the TasksListPage component against the writeApp.md directives to see if the implementation satisfies the test spec requirements. , Has `data-testid=\"tasks-header\"` ✓\n- Has `data-testid=\"new-task-button\"` ✓\n- Has `data-testid=\"task-success-message\"` ✓\n- No native `<select>` elements ✓\n- Uses TaskFormModal for creating tasks ✓\n- No outer padding in component root ✓ (uses `page-header` class, which is a layout class presumably handled by the page)\n\n### TasksFilter.tsx\n- Has `data-testid` on all interactive elements ✓\n- Uses custom dropdown, no native `<select>` ✓ (directive 10)\n- No outer padding ✓\n\n### TasksList.tsx\n- Has `data-testid` on list, cards, badges, names, due dates, assignees, actions ✓\n- Has `data-testid` on action menu items ✓\n- Has `data-testid` on delete confirm modal ✓\n- Uses custom components for modals ✓\n- No native `<select>` ✓\n\n### TaskFormModal.tsx\n- Uses SearchableSelect for Client, Assignee, and Deal ✓ (directive 8)\n- Uses PriorityDropdown (custom) instead of native select ✓ (directive 10)\n- Has `data-testid` on all form fields and buttons ✓\n- No outer padding ✓\n\nNow I need to verify the backend function for tasks against directive 5.\n\nI'm noticing that `handleComplete` in TasksList.tsx dispatches `updateTask` but doesn't refetch the list afterward, while `handleUpdate` does call `fetchTasks()`. This could be a problem if the Redux slice doesn't automatically remove completed tasks from the items list. Let me check how the tasksSlice handles updates and also verify the backend behavior.\n\nNow I'm checking the layout structure — the component roots don't have outer padding, which follows the directive that components should be layout-agnostic.

Write a test entry for each one.\" This means I need to verify that the test entries cover every element in the mockup.\n\n\nLet me fetch the mockup image to see what elements are actually present.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":308,"cache_read_input_tokens":80374,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":308,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a49dc755-058a-48a7-974f-98c9aa1b4770","uuid":"237c4b7e-c2d9-45b9-a81c-4eaaaa525ad1"}

Let me inventory every visible element:\n\n1. **Header/Navigation bar**: TaskFlow logo, Dashboard, Projects, Tasks (highlighted/active), Team, user avatar with dropdown\n2. **Page title**: \"Upcoming Tasks\" (large, bold)\n3. **New Task button**: Blue button with \"New Task\" text in the top-right\n4. **Filter bar**: Filter icon with dropdown chevron, \"Filter...\" text input\n5. **Task cards** (4 cards shown):\n   - Card 1: Red \"High\" badge, \"Finalize Q3 Marketing Plan\", \"Due: Today, 5:00 PM\", avatar, \"Sarah J. \n\n(PM)\", \"...\" action menu\n   - Card 2: Yellow \"Medium\" badge, \"Review Client Proposal Draft\", \"Due: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM\", avatar, \"David L. (Sales)\", \"...\" action menu\n   - Card 3: Green \"Low\" badge, \"Update Team Documentation\", \"Due: Oct 25, 2024\", avatar, \"Emily C. (Dev)\", \"...\" action menu\n   - Card 4: Blue/teal \"Normal\" badge, \"Prepare Weekly Status Report\", \"Due: Oct 26, 2024\", avatar, \"Mark R. (Lead)\", \"...\" action menu\n\nLet me verify these match the test entries I'm working with.\n\nNow I'm checking that all the key elements are present and correctly styled—the page title, the blue New Task button, the filter controls with both dropdown and text input, the color-coded priority badges, bold task names, proper date formatting, and assignee information with avatars and roles all line up with what the tests expect.\n\nThe action menu and task ordering by due date are also accounted for. Since the navigation bar is a shared component across the app, that's handled separately and doesn't need to be part of these specific test entries.\n\nEverything in the mockup appears to be covered, so I'm ready to move forward with finalizing the analysis across all three jobs. through all testSpec.md directives against the TasksListPage test entries:\n\n1. **\"Images of different pages might not have consistent styling or navigation elements\"** - The test entries reference consistent components (sidebar navigation is tested elsewhere). ✓\n\n2. **\"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\"** - Checked against mockup:\n   - Heading \"Upcoming Tasks\" ✓\n   - \"New Task\" blue button ✓\n   - Filter dropdown with icon + chevron ✓\n   - Filter text input with \"Filter...\" placeholder ✓\n   - Task cards with: priority badge, task name (bold), due date, assignee avatar + abbreviated name + role, \"...\" action menu ✓\n   - All elements accounted for ✓\n\n3. **\"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements\"** - No substitutions detected ✓\n\n4. **\"For every clickable element, test entry must specify exact navigation target or action result\"** - Verifying that the New Task button opens a dialog with specific fields, the filter dropdown shows category options, clicking a task card navigates to the Client Detail Page, the action menu items each have defined outcomes (View Details and Edit navigate or open dialogs, Mark as Complete removes the task and updates related pages, Delete shows a confirmation then removes the task), all with proper side effects accounted for. ✓\n\n5. **\"For any user action that mutates data, verify persistence and side effects\"** - Checking that creating a task persists it and shows it in the client's Tasks section, and when linked to a deal it also appears in that deal's Linked Tasks section. Edit task → persisted to database ✓\n   - Mark Complete → reflected in client Tasks and deal Linked Tasks ✓\n   - Delete → removed from client Tasks and deal Linked Tasks ✓\n\n6. **\"Button and control appearance matters\"** - New Task button appearance tested (blue primary), priority badge colors tested ✓\n\n7. **\"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\"**:\n   - New Task dialog: open, validate, submit success, cancel ✓\n   - Edit dialog: open pre-populated, save changes, cancel ✓\n   - Delete confirmation: confirm + cancel ✓\n\n8. **\"Attachment functionality should support file uploads\"** - Not applicable to TasksListPage ✓\n\n9. **\"Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\"** - Not applicable ✓\n\n10. **\"Backend integrations... setup instructions\"** - Not applicable ✓\n\n11. **\"State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update\"** - Verified that creating, completing, and deleting tasks all propagate correctly across the client Tasks section and deal Linked Tasks ✓\n\nNo violations found for testSpec.md directives. Now I'm checking the TasksListPage components against writeApp.md requirements, starting with the page wrapper and header to ensure test entries are properly satisfied. - \"New Task\" button with blue primary styling ✓\n- Opens TaskFormModal ✓\n- Shows success message ✓\n- Has data-testid on all elements ✓\n\n### TasksFilter.tsx\n- Custom dropdown (not native select) ✓\n- Filter icon with chevron ✓\n- Options: All Fields, Priority, Assignee, Client, Due Date ✓\n- Text input with \"Filter...\" placeholder ✓\n- Clear button ✓\n- Changing filter type resets text ✓\n- Has data-testid on all elements ✓\n\n### TasksList.tsx\n- Priority badges with color classes ✓\n- Task name in bold (CSS class task-name) ✓\n- Due date formatting (Today, Tomorrow, absolute) ✓\n- Assignee with avatar (initials-based), abbreviated name, and role ✓\n- Action menu with View Details, Edit, Mark as Complete, Delete ✓\n- Delete confirmation modal ✓\n- Empty state when no tasks ✓\n- No results state when filter matches nothing ✓\n- Tasks are sorted by due date (from backend) ✓\n- Has data-testid on all elements ✓\n\n### TaskFormModal.tsx\n- Uses SearchableSelect for Client, Assignee, Deal ✓\n- PriorityDropdown is custom, not native select ✓\n- All fields: Task Name, Due Date, Priority, Assignee, Client, Deal ✓\n- Validation: Task name required ✓\n- Has data-testid on all elements ✓\n\nNow I'm checking the visual appearance against the mockup, starting with the blue color scheme.\n\nI notice the mockup shows photo avatars while the implementation uses text initials instead. Let me verify if this is intentional or if it's a discrepancy I need to flag. I think initials-based avatars are actually fine here since there's no photo data available in the task or assignee information, and this is a standard design pattern anyway. The directive about matching visual appearance doesn't require photo avatars if the data doesn't support them. Now I'm checking the data-testid attributes across the components to see if they're properly implemented. Verifying that all nullable database fields like description, client_id, deal_id, assignee, and due_date properly convert empty strings to null, and confirming the resource ID extraction from the URL path, searchable dropdowns for related entities, and that navigation doesn't have duplicate links.\n\nChecking that no native HTML selects are used anywhere, file attachments aren't relevant here, and the main page has proper padding while child components stay layout-agnostic without their own outer padding.\n\nLet me verify the JSX abstraction requirement—TasksListPage correctly delegates to TasksHeader, TasksFilter, and TasksList as separate components. The heading styling with the h1 element and page-title class matches the mockup's large bold text requirement.\n\nFor the action menu, I notice it conditionally renders \"View Details\" only when a task has a client_id, which aligns with how the tests are structured—they only verify this option for tasks associated with clients.\n\nNow I'm checking the test directives from writeTests.md against the TasksListPage test suite, starting with navigation target verification.\n\nChecking navigation assertions across the task tests: the \"New Task\" test confirms navigation to the client tasks section, while the \"View Details\" and task card click tests both verify the URL matches the expected client detail page pattern. These all look correct.\n\nFor the cross-page component interaction requirement, the tests interact with task components on the tasks page itself and verify navigation to client pages, which satisfies the directive.\n\nOn side effects, the \"Mark as Complete\" and \"Delete\" actions both verify the task is removed from the list and check the API state, plus confirm the client Tasks section updates. The \"Create\" action verifies the task appears and the client section updates. The tests don't explicitly assert side effects happen exactly once, though the removal checks with `toHaveCount(0)` and visibility assertions implicitly verify this. Since tasks don't generate history entries or other repeatable side effects, this constraint may not be relevant here.\n\nFor selector specificity, all three test files consistently use `getByTestId` rather than `getByText` with generic terms, and the data-testid values like `task-form-modal`, `task-card-`, and `task-priority-` are standardized across the header and list specs.\n\nThe remaining checks show no `.toPass()` retry blocks, strategy files aren't relevant here, and there's a mismatch in the Edit test where it changes priority from Medium to Low but the spec entry claims it should go from High to Medium. to Low\". This is a minor discrepancy in priority values but tests the same functionality. Actually wait - the test entry (docs/tests.md) says to change from \"High\" to \"Medium\", but the test implementation uses a Medium-priority task and changes to Low. This is because the test creates its own tasks with specific priorities and tests the edit flow. The key is that the edit functionality is tested correctly - changing a priority and verifying the badge updates. ✓\n\n10. **\"Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test\"** - Not specific to TasksListPage ✓\n\n11. **\"Auth flows with email-based verification must have dedicated tests\"** - Not specific to TasksListPage ✓\n\n12. **Parallel Test Design directives**: The tests create unique tasks with timestamps and filter by specific text rather than asserting on total counts, they discover IDs from the UI or API instead of hardcoding them, and both spec files use `beforeAll` hooks to set up test-specific tasks with unique identifiers. ✓\n\nNow I'm noticing a potential issue - the \"empty state\" test marks all tasks as completed then restores them, which could interfere with other tests in the same worker. Though tests within a spec file run sequentially by default, I need to verify how the `fullyParallel` setting actually affects this. Within the same spec file, tests run sequentially, so the empty state test completes its mutations and restores everything before the next test runs. The real concern is whether `fullyParallel: true` actually keeps tests in the same describe block sequential when they share `beforeAll`, or if it breaks that guarantee—and if the global task mutations could conflict with other workers running in parallel.\n\nActually, since workers for the same spec file share a database, this setup should be acceptable even with the directive's constraints. The empty state test does create a global mutation, but it restores the state afterward within the same isolated spec file.\n\nNow I'm checking the \"New Task with optional deal association\" test—it uses `page.goto()` to navigate to the client page for verification purposes, not as a workaround for missing navigation. That's different from the directive's concern, which is about using `goto()` to bypass broken UI navigation. This is legitimate cross-page verification.\n\nLet me look more carefully at the \"View Details\" action menu test to see if there's an issue there.\n\nThe test checks that navigating from the task triggers a URL change to a client page, but it only asserts a generic client URL pattern rather than verifying it's the specific Acme Corp client. Since the task was created with the correct client ID and the navigation uses that same ID, the test should land on the right page even if the assertion isn't perfectly specific. This feels like a minor precision issue rather than a clear violation of the testing directive. of the precision requirement. The regex only confirms navigation to *some* client page, not the specific one—if the code accidentally routed to the wrong client, the test would still pass. I should flag this as a violation since the test could verify the exact client ID in the URL or check the page content to confirm it's showing the right client's details. I'm now reviewing the actual test titles in the spec files to verify they match the test entry names. Looking at tasks-header.spec.ts, the tests align well with their entries. In tasks-filter.spec.ts, I can see the filter-related tests are listed, though the list appears to be cut off partway through. I'm reviewing the task list component tests, checking that assignee information displays correctly with avatars and abbreviated names, tasks are properly sorted by due date, and all the action menu operations work as expected—viewing details, editing, completing, and deleting tasks. The empty state handling and navigation to client detail pages are also verified, and I've confirmed all test titles align with their implementations.\n\nNow I'm noticing a precision issue with the navigation tests. The \"View Details\" and \"Clicking a task card\" tests only verify navigation to a generic `/clients/` URL pattern, but according to the test requirements, they should assert navigation to the specific client's page. The \"Mark as Complete\" test does this correctly by checking for the exact client ID in the URL, so I need to flag that the other two tests are missing this specificity. uses regex `/\\/clients\\//` which is imprecise.\n\nSo my findings for violations:\n\n**writeTests.md violations:**\n1. `tasks-list.spec.ts` \"Action menu 'View Details' navigates to associated client detail page\" - Uses imprecise URL check `/\\/clients\\//` instead of verifying the specific client URL or page content\n2. `tasks-list.spec.ts` \"Clicking a task card navigates to associated client detail page\" - Same issue\n\nThese are the same root cause, so they can be grouped into one fix.\n\nActually, thinking about it more... these tests could verify the URL more precisely by checking for the specific client ID. The tasks were created with known client_id values, so the test can construct the expected URL. Or it could verify the client name on the page.\n\nLet me look at the actual test implementation for \"View Details\" to see what's currently being checked...\n\nThe test clicks the action menu and then the \"View Details\" option, then just asserts the page navigated to `/clients/` something. But it doesn't verify which client. The comment says \"for Acme Corp\" but the assertion doesn't check that.\n\nFor the \"Clicking card\" test, it's cut off but seems to be doing something similar - clicking a task card and checking navigation, but the assertion is incomplete in what I can see.\n\nBoth tests need to be more specific about which client page they're navigating to. The test only verifies the High priority badge but skips checking the due date and assignee details that the spec explicitly requires, which violates the directive that tests must exercise every field mentioned in the spec with corresponding assertions.\n\nLooking at the \"Action menu 'Edit'\" test, it does open the dialog and verify the name gets pre-populated, changes the priority (though using different values than specified), and confirms the badge updates and persists—but it's missing verification that all the other pre-populated fields like due date, assignee, client, and deal actually appear in the dialog as the spec describes. The edit dialog spec explicitly lists multiple fields that should be pre-populated, but the test only verifies the name field, which violates the requirement to exercise all mentioned fields. I should focus on the clearest violations: the imprecise URL assertions in the navigation tests, the incomplete pre-population verification in the edit test, and I'm starting to identify similar issues in the header spec file.\n\nLooking at the root causes, I can see these violations fall into two distinct patterns. The navigation tests have imprecise URL matching that doesn't verify the specific client ID, while the field verification issues stem from tests not checking all the fields the spec explicitly mentions should be present. I'll group these into separate fix jobs since they have different underlying causes. Looking at the Edit spec entry more carefully, the test only validates the task name field is pre-populated but skips checking due date, priority, assignee, client, and deal—that's another violation of the directive requiring all mentioned fields to be exercised. The priority change itself is acceptable since it uses the same mechanism even with different values, and the badge update verification works regardless.\n\nFor the database persistence, the refetch implicitly confirms the change was saved, so that's fine. I'm going to consolidate these test issues into a single FixViolation about incomplete assertions across the TasksListPage tests since they all stem from insufficient field coverage. My findings are: no violations in the spec check, no violations in the components check, and one violation in the tests check.\n\nNow I'm identifying the specific issues—imprecise URL assertions in the navigation tests and incomplete field assertions when creating and editing tasks.
