Let me analyze:\n\n1. **Fix ambiguous navigation (line 838-841)**: The current test says \"The dialog closes (or a new tab/window opens)\" - this violates the directive \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\"\n\nLooking at the actual code in ReportPreview.tsx line 236-238:\n```tsx\nconst handleAccountClick = (accountId: string) => {\n    navigate(`/accounts/${accountId}`);\n};\n```\n\nAnd in the CreateReportDialog, the `onClose` is called only via explicit button clicks and overlay click. \n\nThe `handleAccountClick` function uses React Router's client-side navigation to route to `/accounts/{accountId}`, which changes the page entirely and causes the dialog to disappear as a side effect rather than through an explicit close action.\n\nNow I'm looking at the CreateReportDialog component to understand how the overlay and backdrop interact - there's an `onClick` handler on the overlay that should trigger `onClose`, while the modal content itself stops event propagation to prevent accidental dismissals.\n\nI notice that NewTransactionModal has a test for this backdrop-click behavior, but CreateReportDialog doesn't have an equivalent test yet. I need to find where the other CreateReportDialog tests are located so I can add this missing test case in the appropriate spot.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5376,"cache_read_input_tokens":33249,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5376,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"05cd3a4a-b9c8-46f1-abfa-a4583114ba79","uuid":"b970cf59-452f-4bdb-949b-5bb52c02fc5c"}
