Create a strategy for generating test failure reports from logs\n2. Queue jobs using `add-group.ts` - batching the 107 logs into reasonable groups\n\nLet me think about the batching. Each job should analyze a batch of logs and extract test failures. Given 107 logs, I should batch them into groups of maybe 10 logs per job. That's about 11 jobs. But all jobs in a group share the same strategy, and jobs within a group are processed together in a single prompt. So I should make multiple groups, each with a reasonable number of logs.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully - the worker processes job groups sequentially. \n\nFor each group, it passes ALL jobs to Claude as a single prompt. So if I put too many jobs in a single group, the context will be too large. I'll batch by about 10 logs per job, with each job specifying which log files to analyze, and then add a final \"compile report\" job at the end. The strategy will guide the worker on what to do, and since the worker sends all jobs in a group as a single prompt, I need to keep groups manageable. With 107 logs, I should create batches of roughly 10 logs per group, each with its own strategy.\n\nActually, I'm reconsidering the scale here. Having 10 logs per group would create around 11 groups with 10 jobs each, but processing that many logs in a single worker iteration could be heavy since each log requires reading and produces substantial output. Maybe I should reduce it to 5 logs per job with 3-4 jobs per group, which would give me 7-8 groups total. Let me simplify this approach—each group will contain jobs that batch multiple logs together, with the strategy instructing how to handle them. I'm settling on batches of 5 logs per group to keep the worker's context manageable, which gives me around 22 groups total. Now I'll document this strategy and start queuing up the jobs with the trailing flag to add them to the existing queue.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3910,"cache_read_input_tokens":31304,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3910,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"fa801593-d2c7-43ac-bc85-eb89c1908ac2","uuid":"9dc5141a-c20c-45af-a961-219d7b59f9ca"}
