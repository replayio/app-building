See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2.

Let me systematically go through each directive.\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n1. Consistent styling/navigation over exact mockup adherence\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element — write test entry for each\n3. Do not substitute easier elements for what mockup shows\n4. Every clickable element must specify exact navigation target or action result\n5. Data mutations must verify persistence and exact side effects (no duplicates)\n6. Button/control appearance (text, icons, styling) must be tested\n7. Completely test modal dialogs\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must test that other parts of the app update (history, reciprocal relationships)\n\nNow let me go through each OrderDetailsPage section and test entry systematically.\n\n### OrderSummary section (lines 456-499)\n\n- **Display Order ID in Header** — Tests heading display. OK.\n- **Display Supplier Name as Link** — Specifies navigation target `/suppliers/<supplierId>`. OK per directive 4.\n- **Display Order Date** — Tests date display. OK.\n- **Display Expected Delivery Date** — Tests date display. OK.\n- **Display Status Badge** — Tests badge appearance with color-coded statuses. OK per directive 6.\n- **Display Overall Cost** — Tests currency formatting. OK.\n- **Edit Button Opens Edit Dialog** — Tests modal dialog, specifies fields (expected delivery, status), persistence, and history entry side effect. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n- **Print Button Triggers Print** — Tests browser print dialog. OK per directive 4.\n\n### LineItemsTable section (lines 501-546)\n\n- **Display Line Items Table with Correct Columns** — Tests column headers. OK.\n- **Display Line Item Row Data** — Tests row data with currency formatting. OK.\n- **Display Multiple Line Items** — Tests all line items. OK.\n- **Add Line Item** — Tests modal, persistence, CostBreakdown update, and history entry. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n- **Edit Line Item** — Tests modal pre-fill, persistence, CostBreakdown update, and history entry. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n- **Delete Line Item** — Tests confirmation dialog, CostBreakdown update, and history entry. OK per directives 5, 7, 11.\n\n### CostBreakdown section (lines 548-575)\n\n- **Display Subtotal** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Display Tax with Percentage** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Display Discount with Label** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Display Total Cost with Currency** — Tests value. OK.\n- **Cost Breakdown Updates When Line Items Change** — Tests recalculation. OK per directive 11.\n\n### OrderDocuments section (lines 577-614)\n\n- **Display Document List** — Tests document entries. OK.\n- **Display Document Details** — Tests specific document. OK.\n- **Display Multiple Documents** — Tests all documents. OK.\n- **View Button Opens Document** — Tests \"View\" button action (new tab). OK per directive 4.\n- **Download Button Downloads Document** — Tests download action. OK per directive 4.\n- **Upload Document** — Tests file upload dialog, document type entry, persistence, and history entry. OK per directives 7, 8, 11.\n\n### OrderHistory section (lines 616-650)\n\n- **Display Timeline of Events** — Tests vertical timeline. OK.\n- **Display Event Timestamp and Description** — Tests specific entry. OK.\n- **Display All History Entries** — Tests all entries in reverse chronological order. OK.\n- **Timeline Entry Icons** — Tests icon appearance per event type. OK per directive 6.\n- **History Entry Created on Status Change** — Tests \"exactly one\" entry. OK per directive 5.\n- **History Entry Created on Line Item Modification** — Tests \"exactly one\" entry. OK per directive 5.\n\nLet me check a few things more carefully. Let me review if there are any missing test entries by looking at the app spec and components.\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/docs/AppSpec.md\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/docs/AppRevisions.md\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/pages/OrderDetailsPage*\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/order*/**\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/**/*rder*\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/**/*Order*\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/*ine*\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/*Cost*\nGood. The OrderDetailsPage has these components: OrderSummary, LineItemsTable, CostBreakdown, OrderDocuments, OrderHistory. The test spec covers all of them. Let me also check if there's an AppSpec to verify completeness.\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/docs/*\n[read] /repo/apps/SupplierTracker/docs/mockup-order-details.png\nNow let me carefully compare the mockup to the test entries and check all testSpec.md directives against the OrderDetailsPage entries (lines 450-650 of docs/tests.md).\n\n### Findings for CheckTestSpecOrderDetailsPage\n\nI'll check each directive systematically:\n\n**Directive 1 (Consistent styling/navigation):** The breadcrumb description at line 452 is consistent with other pages. OK.\n\n**Directive 2 (Inventory every visible element):** The breadcrumb links (\"Dashboard\", \"Orders\") are visible clickable elements in the mockup but have NO dedicated test entries — they're only described in the section header text at line 452. This is a violation.\n\n**Directive 3 (Don't substitute easier elements):** All columns, fields, and sections from the mockup appear to be tested as shown. OK.\n\n**Directive 4 (Every clickable element specifies navigation target):** The breadcrumb links specify targets in the section description but lack actual test entries. Violation (same as directive 2).\n\n**Directive 5 (Mutations verify persistence and side effects):** Edit, Add/Edit/Delete line items, and Upload Document all mention history entry side effects. The \"exactly one\" constraint is enforced in the dedicated OrderHistory test entries (lines 642, 647). OK.\n\n**Directive 6 (Button/control appearance):** Edit button (pencil icon + \"Edit\"), Print button (printer icon + \"Print\"), status badge colors, timeline icons — all tested. OK.\n\n**Directive 7 (Completely test modal dialogs):** This is a **violation**. The DashboardPage has separate cancel and validation test entries for every dialog (lines 40-49, 62-71), but OrderDetailsPage dialogs are missing these:\n- **Edit Order dialog**: No cancel test, no validation test\n- **Add Line Item dialog**: No cancel test, no validation test\n- **Edit Line Item dialog**: No cancel test\n- **Delete Line Item confirmation**: No cancel test\n- **Upload Document dialog**: No cancel test\n\n**Directive 8 (File uploads):** Upload Document entry specifies file upload. OK.\n\n**Directive 9 (Import format docs):** Not applicable — no data import dialogs on this page.\n\n**Directive 10 (Backend integrations):** Not applicable to this page.\n\n**Directive 11 (State-changing updates across app):** Edit, Add/Edit/Delete line items all specify CostBreakdown and OrderHistory updates. OK.\n\n### Violations Summary (TestSpec)\n\n1. **Missing breadcrumb navigation test entries** — Clickable breadcrumb links lack dedicated test entries (directives 2, 4)\n2. **Missing modal cancel/validation test entries** — OrderDetailsPage dialogs lack cancel and validation tests that DashboardPage dialogs have (directive 7)\n\nLet me add fix tasks for these.\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\" --app \"SupplierTracker\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixViolation: Add missing breadcrumb navigation test entries for OrderDetailsPage in docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixViolation: Add missing modal cancel/validation test entrie...

Now let me start **Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage**. I need to systematically check each test entry in the SupplierDetailsPage section of `docs/tests.md` against the testSpec.md directives. The SupplierDetailsPage test entries span lines 226-447 of docs/tests.md. Let me re-read th... (truncated)\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage\n\nThe SupplierDetailsPage section in docs/tests.md (lines 226-447) has these sections:\n- **SupplierOverview** (lines 232-279)\n- **DocumentsTab** (lines 281-323)\n- **CommentsSection** (lines 325-364)\n- **OrdersSection** (lines 366-446)\n\nLet me now systematically check each test entry against testSpec.md directives.\n\n### Checking testSpec.md directives against SupplierDetailsPage entries:\n\n**Directive 1: Systematically inventory every visible element — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n\nLet me check each section:\n\n**SupplierOverview section** (lines 232-279):\n- Display Supplier Name ✓\n- Display Supplier Address ✓ \n- Display Contact Information ✓\n- Display Supplier Description ✓\n- Display Status Badge ✓\n- Back to Dashboard Button Navigates to Dashboard ✓\n- Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog ✓\n- Delete Supplier with Confirmation ✓\n\n**Breadcrumb navigation** (line 228): Specified: \"Home > Suppliers > \\<Supplier Name\\> > Supplier Details\". Clicking \"Home\" → /. Clicking \"Suppliers\" → /.\n\nLet me check: is there a test entry for the breadcrumb navigation itself? Let me re-read the section carefully.\n\nLooking at lines 226-228:\n```\n## SupplierDetailsPage (/suppliers/:supplierId)\n\nBreadcrumb navigation shows \"Home > Suppliers > <Supplier Name> > Supplier Details\". Clicking \"Home\" navigates to /. Clicking \"Suppliers\" navigates to /.\n```\n\nThis specifies breadcrumb behavior but there's no dedicated test entry for it. Let me check if there's a test entry for breadcrumb.\n\nLooking at the SupplierDetailsPage section... I see there's no test entry titled for the breadcrumb navigation. The breadcrumb is described in the page header but not as a testable entry with a Given/When/Then.\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.**\n\nThe breadcrumb has clickable elements (\"Home\" → /, \"Suppliers\" → /) but no dedicated test entry. However, the behavior IS specified at line 228 — it just doesn't follow Given/When/Then format as a test entry.\n\nLet me also check the tab links described at line 230: \"Below the SupplierOverview section, three tab links appear: 'Documents', 'Comments', 'Orders'. Clicking a tab scrolls to or reveals that section's content.\"\n\nThere's no test entry for the tab navigation itself.\n\n**DocumentsTab section** (lines 281-323):\n- Display Document Cards with Details ✓\n- Display Multiple Document Cards ✓\n- Search Documents by Name ✓\n- Search Documents Clears Results ✓\n- Upload Document Button Opens Upload Dialog ✓\n- View Document Action ✓\n- Download Document Action ✓\n\n**Directive 8: Attachment functionality should support file uploads**\nThe Upload Document test entry (lines 307-313) does specify file upload. ✓\n\n**CommentsSection** (lines 325-364):\n- Display Comments Header with Count ✓\n- Display Comment List with Timestamps and Authors ✓\n- Add Comment via Input Field ✓\n- Add Comment Persists After Reload ✓\n- Collapse and Expand Comments Section ✓\n- Empty Comment Validation ✓\n\n**Directive 5: For any user action that mutates data, verify change is persisted and side effects occur**\n- \"Add Comment via Input Field\" verifies the comment appears and count increments ✓\n- \"Add Comment Persists After Reload\" verifies persistence ✓\n\n**OrdersSection** (lines 366-446):\n- Display Upcoming and Historical Order Tabs ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Data ✓\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Data ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Search Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Search Historical Orders ✓\n- Filter Upcoming Orders by Status ✓\n- Status Badges in Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Status Badges in Historical Orders ✓\n- Switch Between Tabs ✓\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target**\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78901\" ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78801\" ✓\n\n**Directive 7: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**\n- Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog: Tests opening, pre-filled values, save, and persistence ✓\n- Delete Supplier with Confirmation: Tests confirmation dialog ✓\n- Upload Document: Tests file upload dialog ✓\n\nNow let me check if there's a test entry for the **Edit Supplier Dialog Validation** — the directive says to completely test modal dialogs. The edit dialog has a save action but no validation test. Let me also check if there's a cancel test for edit. Looking at the entry on line 266-270:\n\n```\n**Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog**\nGiven the user is viewing the SupplierDetailsPage,\nWhen the user clicks the \"Edit\" button in SupplierOverview,\nThen a modal dialog opens pre-filled with the supplier's current values (name, address, contact name, phone, email, description, status),\nAnd when the user changes the contact phone number and clicks \"Save\",\nThen the updated phone number is persisted and reflected in SupplierOverview.\n```\n\nThere's no cancel test and no validation test for the Edit Supplier dialog. For the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard, there ARE cancel and validation entries. This is inconsistent.\n\nSimilarly, for the Delete Supplier, there's no test for what happens if the user cancels the confirmation dialog.\n\nLet me also check if there are missing entries per **Directive 6: Button and control appearance matters**. I see status badge entries cover color coding. Let me check if there are entries for the Edit/Delete button appearance (icons, styling).\n\nThe Edit button mention at line 267 says \"Edit\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\nThe Delete button mention at line 273 says \"Delete\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\n\nHowever, this level of detail may not be required since the spec doesn't show a mockup for this page.\n\nLet me now also check: the breadcrumb navigation is specified in the header but not tested with entries. I see the Dashboard page also specifies breadcrumb for detail pages at line 10: \"Breadcrumb navigation appears on detail pages (SupplierDetailsPage, OrderDetailsPage).\"\n\nLet me check if there are test entries for breadcrumb navigation in the OrderDetailsPage section for comparison.\n\nLooking at line 452: \"Breadcrumb navigation shows 'Dashboard > Orders > Order #\\<orderId\\>'. Clicking 'Dashboard' navigates to /. Clicking 'Orders' navigates to /.\"\n\nSame pattern — breadcrumb specified in header but no dedicated test entries. This is consistent across pages, so while it could be a violation, it's a pattern across the whole app.\n\nLet me now summarize the potential violations I've found:\n\n1. **Missing breadcrumb navigation test entries** — The breadcrumb is described in the page header but lacks dedicated Given/When/Then test entries. Per directive \"systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"for every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation targe... (truncated)\n\n2. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog cancel test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a cancel test (similar to how the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard has \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\").\n\n3. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog validation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a validation test (similar to \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" on the Dashboard).\n\n4. **Missing Delete Supplier cancel confirmation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Delete Supplier confirmation should have a test for canceling/dismissing the confirmation.\n\nWait — let me re-check if the breadcrumb issue was already found and fixed. Let me check the recent commits.\n$ git log --oneline -20\n88bd202 CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage: Check testSpec.md direc...

However, the behavior IS specified at line 228 — it just doesn't follow Given/When/Then format as a test entry.\n\nLet me also check the tab links described at line 230: \"Below the SupplierOverview section, three tab links appear: 'Documents', 'Comments', 'Orders'. Clicking a tab scrolls to or reveals that section's content.\"\n\nThere's no test entry for the tab navigation itself.\n\n**DocumentsTab section** (lines 281-323):\n- Display Document Cards with Details ✓\n- Display Multiple Document Cards ✓\n- Search Documents by Name ✓\n- Search Documents Clears Results ✓\n- Upload Document Button Opens Upload Dialog ✓\n- View Document Action ✓\n- Download Document Action ✓\n\n**Directive 8: Attachment functionality should support file uploads**\nThe Upload Document test entry (lines 307-313) does specify file upload. ✓\n\n**CommentsSection** (lines 325-364):\n- Display Comments Header with Count ✓\n- Display Comment List with Timestamps and Authors ✓\n- Add Comment via Input Field ✓\n- Add Comment Persists After Reload ✓\n- Collapse and Expand Comments Section ✓\n- Empty Comment Validation ✓\n\n**Directive 5: For any user action that mutates data, verify change is persisted and side effects occur**\n- \"Add Comment via Input Field\" verifies the comment appears and count increments ✓\n- \"Add Comment Persists After Reload\" verifies persistence ✓\n\n**OrdersSection** (lines 366-446):\n- Display Upcoming and Historical Order Tabs ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Data ✓\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Data ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Search Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Search Historical Orders ✓\n- Filter Upcoming Orders by Status ✓\n- Status Badges in Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Status Badges in Historical Orders ✓\n- Switch Between Tabs ✓\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target**\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78901\" ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78801\" ✓\n\n**Directive 7: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**\n- Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog: Tests opening, pre-filled values, save, and persistence ✓\n- Delete Supplier with Confirmation: Tests confirmation dialog ✓\n- Upload Document: Tests file upload dialog ✓\n\nNow let me check if there's a test entry for the **Edit Supplier Dialog Validation** — the directive says to completely test modal dialogs. The edit dialog has a save action but no validation test. Let me also check if there's a cancel test for edit. Looking at the entry on line 266-270:\n\n```\n**Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog**\nGiven the user is viewing the SupplierDetailsPage,\nWhen the user clicks the \"Edit\" button in SupplierOverview,\nThen a modal dialog opens pre-filled with the supplier's current values (name, address, contact name, phone, email, description, status),\nAnd when the user changes the contact phone number and clicks \"Save\",\nThen the updated phone number is persisted and reflected in SupplierOverview.\n```\n\nThere's no cancel test and no validation test for the Edit Supplier dialog. For the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard, there ARE cancel and validation entries. This is inconsistent.\n\nSimilarly, for the Delete Supplier, there's no test for what happens if the user cancels the confirmation dialog.\n\nLet me also check if there are missing entries per **Directive 6: Button and control appearance matters**. I see status badge entries cover color coding. Let me check if there are entries for the Edit/Delete button appearance (icons, styling).\n\nThe Edit button mention at line 267 says \"Edit\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\nThe Delete button mention at line 273 says \"Delete\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\n\nHowever, this level of detail may not be required since the spec doesn't show a mockup for this page.\n\nLet me now also check: the breadcrumb navigation is specified in the header but not tested with entries. I see the Dashboard page also specifies breadcrumb for detail pages at line 10: \"Breadcrumb navigation appears on detail pages (SupplierDetailsPage, OrderDetailsPage).\"\n\nLet me check if there are test entries for breadcrumb navigation in the OrderDetailsPage section for comparison.\n\nLooking at line 452: \"Breadcrumb navigation shows 'Dashboard > Orders > Order #\\<orderId\\>'. Clicking 'Dashboard' navigates to /. Clicking 'Orders' navigates to /.\"\n\nSame pattern — breadcrumb specified in header but no dedicated test entries. This is consistent across pages, so while it could be a violation, it's a pattern across the whole app.\n\nLet me now summarize the potential violations I've found:\n\n1. **Missing breadcrumb navigation test entries** — The breadcrumb is described in the page header but lacks dedicated Given/When/Then test entries. Per directive \"systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"for every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation targe... (truncated)\n\n2. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog cancel test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a cancel test (similar to how the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard has \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\").\n\n3. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog validation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a validation test (similar to \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" on the Dashboard).\n\n4. **Missing Delete Supplier cancel confirmation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Delete Supplier confirmation should have a test for canceling/dismissing the confirmation.\n\nWait — let me re-check if the breadcrumb issue was already found and fixed. Let me check the recent commits.\n$ git log --oneline -20\n88bd202 CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage: Check testSpec.md direc...
