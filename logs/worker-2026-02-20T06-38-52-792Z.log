This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    80→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    81→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01TWxyXunumWPeWY5RxZePeE","session_id":"fa64baa6-b44d-4d53-ad81-d38784970556","uuid":"cb369879-df9a-43a3-af53-be64f37b8847"}

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    30→\n    31→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    32→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    33→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    34→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    35→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    36→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    37→\n    38→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent.

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    45→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    46→\n    47→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    48→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    49→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    50→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    51→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    52→\n    53→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    54→  ```ts\n    55→  await expect(async () => {\n    56→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    57→    const count = await cards.count();\n    58→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    59→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    60→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    61→    }\n    62→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    63→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    64→  ```\n    65→\n    66→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    67→  ```ts\n    68→  await expect(\n    69→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    70→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    71→  ```\n    72→\n    73→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    74→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    79→\n    80→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    81→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    82→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    83→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    84→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    85→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    86→\n    87→## Parallel Test Design\n    88→\n    89→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n    90→Write tests with this in mind:\n    91→\n    92→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n    93→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n    94→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n    95→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n    96→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n    97→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n    98→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n    99→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   100→  being unmodified.\n   101→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   102→  you need to interact with.\n   103→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   108→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   109→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   110→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   111→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   112→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   113→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   114→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   115→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   116→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01TWxyXunumWPeWY5RxZePeE","session_id":"fa64baa6-b44d-4d53-ad81-d38784970556","uuid":"a0f61d37-dbfb-40d4-aaef-814204425869"}

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

CDP-HDR-02 should have a corresponding entry that tests saving the name change persists.\n\n2. **CDP-QA-04**: The stage dropdown lists 'Proposal' but the actual code uses 'Proposal Sent' for the stage label in `AddDealModal.tsx`. The test spec entry should say 'Proposal Sent' not 'Proposal'.\n   \nLet me check what CDP-HDR-02 actually tests in the test file to see if there's already a persistence test I'm missing.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2999,"cache_read_input_tokens":30653,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2999,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"fa64baa6-b44d-4d53-ad81-d38784970556","uuid":"1402db30-1fe3-42e2-bf6b-3f38ea9e7e75"}

Let me also look at the tests.md entries more carefully for the numbering in the CDR-HDR section - I need to understand if adding a new entry means I need to renumber subsequent ones.\n\nLooking at the test spec:\n- CDP-HDR-01: Header displays info (observation only)\n- CDP-HDR-02: Clicking edit allows editing client name (no persistence)\n- CDP-HDR-03: Editing client status persists the change\n- CDP-HDR-04: Editing tags persists the change  \n- CDP-HDR-05: Editing client type persists the change\n\n\nBut the actual test file has completely different tests at those same numbers - the spec says CDP-HDR-03 is about persisting status changes, but the code has it as canceling edit mode. Since the task only asks me to fix CDP-HDR-02 and CDP-QA-04, I'll focus on those specific tests and not worry about the broader mismatch.\n\nFor CDP-HDR-02, the job wants me to add a name save persistence test. Looking at the pattern in the spec where each test verifies persistence, I should add a separate entry that tests saving the name change rather than just making it editable.\n\nBut I'm noticing the test IDs in the actual test code don't match the spec—they seem to have diverged. Since the directive emphasizes testing persistence for any data mutation, I think adding a new test entry is cleaner than modifying the existing one, though I need to be careful about how I handle the numbering to avoid breaking any references. I'm debating whether to modify CDP-HDR-02 directly to include the full persistence flow, or add a separate test entry following the pattern established by the other persistence tests. The job description suggests updating CDP-HDR-02 itself to verify that the name change actually persists.\n\nNow I'm moving on to CDP-QA-04, which needs the stage dropdown option changed from 'Proposal' to 'Proposal Sent' to match what the actual code uses. I should also scan the rest of the test spec to see if 'Proposal' appears elsewhere and needs updating.\n\nLooking at lines 633 and 672, those references are in the deals page context, but since the job specifically calls out CDP-QA-04, I'll focus my changes there. Now I'm ready to make the updates to both test entries.","signature":"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

In the test spec:\n- CDP-QA-01: Quick action buttons are all displayed\n- CDP-QA-02: Add Task opens task creation modal\n- CDP-QA-03: Creating a task via quick action persists\n- CDP-QA-04: Add Deal opens deal creation modal\n- CDP-QA-05: Creating a deal via quick action persists\n\nBut in the test code:\n- CDP-QA-01: Quick action buttons visible\n- CDP-QA-02: Add Task button opens modal\n\n\n- CDP-QA-03: Add Deal button opens modal\n- CDP-QA-04: Add Attachment button opens modal\n- CDP-QA-05: Add Person button opens modal\n\nThe numbering is completely misaligned. Since the job is to fix the testSpec, I need to focus on the two specific fixes: updating CDP-HDR-02 to include the name save persistence test, and changing the stage label in CDP-QA-04 from 'Proposal' to 'Proposal Sent'. I need to check the Playwright test code to see what CDP-QA-04 actually tests, since there seems to be a mismatch between the test spec and the code. The strategy says I should update the app code and tests too, not just the spec, so I need to figure out what changes are actually needed across all three places. to check if the Playwright tests also need updating. For CDP-QA-04, the test spec change is just a label change in the expected text, so the test code doesn't necessarily need to change (unless it asserts on the stage dropdown labels).\n\nLet me check the actual deal creation modal test more carefully for stage option assertions.\n\nActually, I realize the test code tests something different for CDP-QA-04 than the test spec. The test spec CDP-QA-04 is about adding a deal, but the code CDP-QA-04 is about adding an attachment. These are out of sync but that's a separate issue.\n\nLet me just focus on the two specific fixes requested: adding a persistence test for CDP-HDR-02 and updating the stage dropdown label from 'Proposal' to 'Proposal Sent' for CDP-QA-04.

now.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3102,"cache_read_input_tokens":35762,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3102,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   185→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   186→\n   187→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   188→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   189→\n   190→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   191→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   192→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   193→\n   194→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   195→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   196→\n   197→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   198→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   199→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first.

CDP-QA-04 stage dropdown label corrected from 'Proposal' to 'Proposal Sent' to match the actual application UI labels used in AddDealModal and other components.","+"," 2/18/2026: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) and User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId). Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. Added /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members. Sidebar now has \"Team\" nav item. Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal now show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input."]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}
