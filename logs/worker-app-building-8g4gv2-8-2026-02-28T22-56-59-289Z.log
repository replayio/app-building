[2026-02-28T22:51:06.210Z] Pushed to loop-builder
[2026-02-28T22:51:06.211Z] Running task: 3 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md)
[2026-02-28T22:51:06.211Z]   - WriteStatusBackend: Create netlify/functions/status.ts backend function. GET returns: (1) all containers NOT in 'stopped' state with their last_event_at timestamp, (2) the last 50 webhook events received ordered by received_at DESC, (3) the current default_prompt from settings. This powers the status page.
[2026-02-28T22:51:06.211Z]   - WriteStatusPage: Create src/pages/StatusPage.tsx with Redux slice (statusSlice) and route at /status. The page shows: (1) a list/table of all active containers (not stopped) with container name, status, prompt, and last event time, (2) a feed of the last 50 webhook events with timestamp, container_id, event_type, and payload summary, (3) the current default prompt. Poll for updates every 10 seconds. Add data-testid attributes.
[2026-02-28T22:51:06.211Z]   - AddStatusLink: Add a subtle/small link to the status page on MainPage. It should not be a prominent CTA - just a small text link in the header or footer area, e.g. 'System Status' link. Add the /status route to App.tsx.

Based on this assessment, the wizard either (a) rejects the request, displaying a clear rejection message and a reason for rejection, or (b) accepts the request, queues the app for autonomous building, and then shows a confirmation screen with a link to the new app’s AppPage where the user can monitor its progress. The layout should guide the user step-by-step, indicate progress through the wizard, handle validation errors, and clearly communicate the outcome of the assessment.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kds5EP7hTtGH82bSwipudoBvMJrNqh1kgO3jVR\n    17→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01Kckn6RGSH4KWuqjQsxJfBH","session_id":"41911133-1ad1-443e-833e-9fa5f54d1229","uuid":"66fb01d8-f4f0-41ed-bd39-68444edd19e7"}

App Directory and Identity\n\n**App name:** LoopBuilder  \n**App directory:** `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/`  \n**Branch:** `loop-builder`  \n**Netlify config base:** `apps/LoopBuilder` (see `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/netlify.toml`)\n\nThere is **no** `apps/shared/` directory -- no shared reusable components exist.  \nThere is **no** `apps/LoopBuilder/AppStyle.md` or `apps/AppStyle.md` -- these files do not exist.\n\n---\n\n## 2. AppSpec Summary (`/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/AppSpec.md`)\n\nThe app is an **autonomous app builder UI** with three pages:\n\n- **MainPage (`/`)** -- Top status filter (Building/Finished/Queued), \"Request an app\" CTA, grid of app cards\n- **AppPage (`/apps/:id`)** -- Single app detail with title, description, status badge, live/historical activity feed, action buttons\n- **RequestPage (`/request`)** -- Multi-step wizard: Describe -> Assessment -> Confirmation (acceptance or rejection)\n\n---\n\n## 3. AppRevisions (`/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/AppRevisions.md`)\n\nKey backend requirements:\n- Use `@replayio/app-building` npm package for container lifecycle (start/stop/monitor)\n- `ContainerRegistry` tracks container state (alive, stopped, finished)\n- Maps to UI filters: \"Currently being built\" = alive containers, \"Recently finished\" = stopped/completed, \"Queued\" = DB entries without containers\n- Real-time feed on AppPage polls container status/output endpoint\n- Database stores app requests + assessment results; container state joined at query time\n\n---\n\n## 4. Test Specification (`/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/docs/tests.md`)\n\nExtremely detailed BDD-style test specs covering all components across all three pages. Key sections:\n\n- **MainPage:** StatusFilter (5 tests), RequestAppCTA (3 tests), AppCard (7 tests), AppCardGrid (5 tests)\n- **AppPage:** AppHeader (6 tests), AppActions (8 tests), ActivityLog (8 tests), ActivityLogEntry (11 tests)\n- **RequestPage:** WizardStepper (5 tests), DescribeAppForm (8 tests), AssessmentScreen (5 tests), RejectionResult (5 tests), AcceptanceResult (7 tests)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Database Schema (`/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/scripts/schema.ts`)\n\nSix tables:\n\n```sql\n-- Core app data\napps (id TEXT PK, name, description, status DEFAULT 'queued', progress DEFAULT 0,\n      created_at, model, deployment_url, source_url)\n\n-- Request tracking\napp_requests (id SERIAL PK, name, description, requirements, status DEFAULT 'pending',\n              rejection_reason, app_id FK->apps, created_at)\n\n-- Activity feed\nactivity_log (id SERIAL PK, app_id FK->apps, timestamp, log_type, message,\n              detail, expandable BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)\n\n-- Container management\ncontainers (container_id TEXT PK, name, status DEFAULT 'starting', prompt,\n            created_at, last_event_at)\n\n-- Webhook event storage\nwebhook_events (id SERIAL PK, container_id FK->containers, event_type,\n                payload JSONB DEFAULT '{}', received_at)\n\n-- Key-value settings\nsettings (key TEXT PK, value TEXT)\n```\n\nIndexes exist on `apps(status)`, `activity_log(app_id)`, `activity_log(app_id, timestamp DESC)`, `app_requests(app_id)`, `containers(status)`, `webhook_events(container_id)`, `webhook_events(received_at DESC)`, `webhook_events(event_type)`.\n\nMigrations are in `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/scripts/migrate.ts` (three migrations for containers, webhook_events, settings).\n\n---\n\n## 6.

An existing Redux slice for pattern reference\n\nLet me read these files now.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4595,"cache_read_input_tokens":29231,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4595,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"41911133-1ad1-443e-833e-9fa5f54d1229","uuid":"9929e61f-466f-412f-9934-fa79d8ef7c57"}
