NAVIGATION FROM DEAL TO CLIENT\n\n### Navigation Pattern\nFrom a deal detail page, you **cannot directly click the client name** to navigate to the client detail page. The client name is displayed as plain text with `data-testid=\"deal-header-client\"`, but it's not a clickable link.\n\n**To navigate from a deal to its client:**\n1. Get the `client_id` from the deal using the API: `/.netlify/functions/deals/{dealId}`\n2. Navigate manually with: `navigate(`/clients/${clientId}`)`\n\n**Example from test:**\n```typescript\n// Get client_id from the deal\nconst dealRes = await page.request.get(`/.netlify/functions/deals/${dealId}`);\nconst dealData = await dealRes.json();\nconst clientId = dealData.client_id;\n// Then navigate\nawait page.goto(`/clients/${clientId}`);\n```\n\n**Navigation helper function:**\n```typescript\nasync function navigateToFirstClientDetail(page: import('@playwright/test').Page): Promise<string> {\n  await page.goto('/clients');\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n  \n  const rows = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"client-row-\"]');\n  await rows.first().waitFor({ state: 'visible', timeout: 15000 });\n  const testId = await rows.first().getAttribute('data-testid');\n  const clientId = testId!.replace('client-row-', '');\n  \n  await page.goto(`/clients/${clientId}`);\n  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');\n  return clientId;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. CLIENT TIMELINE/ACTIVITY SECTION\n\n### Section Container Test ID\n- **Section test ID:** `timeline-section`\n- **Empty state test ID:** `timeline-empty-state`\n\n### Timeline Structure Test IDs\n| Element | Test ID Pattern | Notes |\n|---------|-----------------|-------|\n| Date group container | `timeline-date-group` | Groups events by relative date |\n| Date label | `timeline-date-label` | Shows \"Today\", \"Yesterday\", \"Last Week\", etc. |\n| Timeline entry | `timeline-entry-{eventId}` | Wrapper for each event |\n| Event description | `timeline-event-description-{eventId}` | Main text describing the event |\n| User name (if present) | `timeline-event-user-{eventId}` | Shows \"by {user_name}\" |\n\n### Supported Event Types (from TimelineSection.tsx)\n```typescript\n'task_created'\n'task_completed'\n'deal_created'\n'deal_stage_changed'\n'note_added'\n'email_sent'\n'contact_added'\n'attachment_added'\n'status_changed'      // Client status change\n'name_changed'        // Client name change\n'tags_changed'        // Client tags change\n'type_changed'        // Client type (Organization/Individual) change\n```\n\n### Timeline Entry Pattern\n- Each entry has a relative date label (grouped by \"Today\", \"Yesterday\", etc.)\n- Each event shows an icon (bullet point), description text, and optional user name\n- Test pattern: `page.locator('[data-testid^=\"timeline-event-description-\"]').filter({ hasText: 'Task Created' })`\n\n### Example Usage\n```typescript\n// Count existing timeline entries\nconst taskCreatedEntries = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"timeline-event-description-\"]').filter({ hasText: 'Task Created' });\nconst initialTimelineCount = await taskCreatedEntries.count();\n\n// After performing an action...\n// Verify exactly one new timeline entry was added (atomic)\nawait expect(taskCreatedEntries).toHaveCount(initialTimelineCount + 1, { timeout: 15000 });\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. CLIENT ATTACHMENTS SECTION\n\n### Section Container Test ID\n- **Section test ID:** `attachments-section`\n- **Empty state test ID:** `attachments-empty-state`\n\n### Attachment Item Test IDs\n| Element | Test ID Pattern | Notes |\n|---------|-----------------|-------|\n| Attachment row | `attachment-item-{attachmentId}` | Wrapper for each attachment |\n| Filename | `attachment-filename-{attachmentId}` | Name/link text |\n| Type badge | `attachment-type-{attachmentId}` | File type label |\n| Created date | `attachment-date-{attachmentId}` | \"Created: MM/DD/YYYY\" |\n| Linked deal | `attachment-deal-{attachmentId}` | \"Linked Deal: {dealName}\" or \"None\" |\n| Download button | `attachment-download-{attachmentId}` | Download link (documents only) |\n| View button | `attachment-view-{attachmentId}` | External link (links/images) |\n| Delete button | `attachment-delete-{attachmentId}` | Delete action |\n| Preview | `attachment-preview` | Visual preview thumbnail |\n\n### File Type Labels\nPossible values for `attachment-type-{id}`:\n```\n'Document', 'Image', 'Video', 'Audio', 'Spreadsheet', 'Presentation', 'Code', 'Archive', 'Link', 'File'\n```\n\n### Attachment Structure\nEach attachment row displays:\n```\n[Preview Icon] [Filename] [Type] [Created Date] [Linked Deal] [Download/View] [Delete]\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n```typescript\n// Check attachments section exists\nconst section = page.getByTestId('attachments-section');\nawait expect(section).toBeVisible();\n\n// Get all attachment items\nconst items = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"attachment-item-\"]');\nconst itemCount = await items.count();\n\n// Find specific attachment by filename\nawait expect(\n  page.locator('[data-testid^=\"attachment-filename-\"]').filter({ hasText: 'Report.pdf' })\n).not.toHaveCount(0);\n\n// Download a document\nconst downloadBtn = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"attachment-download-\"]').first();\nconst [download] = await Promise.all([\n  page.waitForEvent('download'),\n  downloadBtn.click(),\n]);\n\n// Delete attachment (with confirmation)\nawait page.locator('[data-testid^=\"attachment-delete-\"]').first().click();\nconst dialog = page.getByTestId('confirm-dialog');\nawait expect(dialog).toBeVisible();\nawait page.getByTestId('confirm-cancel').click();\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. QUICK ACTION MODALS (Related to Timeline/Attachments)\n\n### Add Attachment Modal Test IDs\n| Element | Test ID |\n|---------|---------|\n| Modal container | `add-attachment-modal` |\n| File upload toggle | `attachment-file-upload-toggle` |\n| Link URL toggle | `attachment-link-url-toggle` |\n| File input | `attachment-file-input` |\n| Link name input | `attachment-link-name-input` |\n| URL input | `attachment-url-input` |\n| Associated deal select | `attachment-associated-deal-select` |\n| Save button | `attachment-save-button` |\n| Cancel button | Cancel button (role: \"button\", name: \"Cancel\") |\n\n---\n\n## 5. ADDITIONAL SECTIONS WITH TEST ID PATTERNS\n\n### Tasks Section\n| Element | Test ID Pattern |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| Section | `tasks-section` |\n| Empty state | `tasks-empty-state` |\n| Task item | `task-item-{taskId}` |\n| Task title | `task-title-{taskId}` |\n| Task checkbox | `task-checkbox-{taskId}` |\n| Deal link (if exists) | `task-deal-link-{dealId}` |\n\n### Deals Section\n| Element | Test ID Pattern |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| Section | `deals-section` |\n| Empty state | `deals-empty-state` |\n| Deal item | `deal-item-{dealId}` |\n| Deal name | `deal-name-{dealId}` |\n| Deal info (stage/value) | `deal-info-{dealId}` |\n\n### People Section\n| Element | Test ID Pattern |\n|---------|-----------------|\n| Section | `people-section` |\n| Empty state | `people-empty-state` |\n| Person item | `person-item-{personId}` |\n| Person name | `person-name-{personId}` |\n\n---\n\n## 6. CLIENT HEADER SECTION\n\n### Header Test IDs\n| Element | Test ID |\n|---------|---------|\n| Header container | `client-header` |\n| Title | `client-header-title` |\n| Type badge | `client-header-type-badge` |\n| Status badge | `client-header-status-badge` |\n| Status dropdown | `client-header-status-dropdown` |\n| Tags container | `client-header-tags` |\n| Edit button | `client-header-edit-button` |\n\n### Edit Mode Test IDs\n| Element | Test ID |\n|---------|---------|\n| Name input | `client-header-name-input` |\n| Type select | `client-header-type-select` |\n| Type select trigger | `client-header-type-select-trigger` |\n| Type option | `client-header-type-select-option-{type}` |\n| Status select | `client-header-status-select` |\n| Tags input | `client-header-tags-input` |\n| Save button | `client-header-save-button` |\n| Cancel button | `client-header-cancel-button` |\n\n### Status Dropdown Test IDs\n| Element | Test ID |\n|---------|---------|\n| Dropdown button | `status-dropdown-button` |\n| Status option | `status-dropdown-option-{status}` |\n\n---\n\n## 7. KEY NAVIGATION PATTERNS\n\n### From Deal Detail to Client Detail\n1. Parse the deal data to get `client_id`\n2. Use `navigate(`/clients/${clientId}`)` or direct URL navigation\n3. Wait for network idle: `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')`\n\n### From Client Detail Back to Deals List\n1. Click on a deal item: `deal-item-{dealId}`\n2. Or navigate directly: `navigate(`/deals/${dealId}`)`\n\n### Timeline Entry Assertions (Atomic Pattern)\n```typescript\n// Count before action\nconst entries = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"timeline-event-description-\"]').filter({ hasText: 'Event Type' });\nconst countBefore = await entries.count();\n\n// Perform action...\n\n// Verify exactly one new entry (prevents flakiness from re-renders)\nawait expect(entries).toHaveCount(countBefore + 1, { timeout: 15000 });\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. QUICK REFERENCE - All Test IDs Summary\n\n**Navigation:**\n- `/clients` → Click `client-row-{clientId}` → `/clients/{clientId}`\n- Deal header shows client name but NOT clickable\n- Must use API to get `client_id`, then navigate\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Container: `timeline-section`\n- Event description: `timeline-event-description-{id}`\n- Date group: `timeline-date-group`\n\n**Attachments:**\n- Container: `attachments-section`\n- Item: `attachment-item-{id}`\n- Filename: `attachment-filename-{id}`\n- Download: `attachment-download-{id}`\n- Delete: `attachment-delete-{id}`\n\n**Related Sections:**\n- Tasks: `task-item-{id}`, `task-title-{id}`, `task-checkbox-{id}`\n- Deals: `deal-item-{id}`, `deal-name-{id}`\n- People: `person-item-{id}`, `person-name-{id}`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a83a78d (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 71511\ntool_uses: 15\nduration_ms: 38994</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d8894957-6e05-4b60-84ce-876a2852255a","uuid":"ad49a363-78ef-474d-97dd-b032bd1362e8","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand how the client detail page works in this SalesCRM app, specifically:\n1.

Or navigate directly: `navigate(`/deals/${dealId}`)`\n\n### Timeline Entry Assertions (Atomic Pattern)\n```typescript\n// Count before action\nconst entries = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"timeline-event-description-\"]').filter({ hasText: 'Event Type' });\nconst countBefore = await entries.count();\n\n// Perform action...\n\n// Verify exactly one new entry (prevents flakiness from re-renders)\nawait expect(entries).toHaveCount(countBefore + 1, { timeout: 15000 });\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. QUICK REFERENCE - All Test IDs Summary\n\n**Navigation:**\n- `/clients` → Click `client-row-{clientId}` → `/clients/{clientId}`\n- Deal header shows client name but NOT clickable\n- Must use API to get `client_id`, then navigate\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Container: `timeline-section`\n- Event description: `timeline-event-description-{id}`\n- Date group: `timeline-date-group`\n\n**Attachments:**\n- Container: `attachments-section`\n- Item: `attachment-item-{id}`\n- Filename: `attachment-filename-{id}`\n- Download: `attachment-download-{id}`\n- Delete: `attachment-delete-{id}`\n\n**Related Sections:**\n- Tasks: `task-item-{id}`, `task-title-{id}`, `task-checkbox-{id}`\n- Deals: `deal-item-{id}`, `deal-name-{id}`\n- People: `person-item-{id}`, `person-name-{id}`"}],"totalDurationMs":38994,"totalTokens":71511,"totalToolUseCount":15,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1832,"cache_read_input_tokens":66759,"output_tokens":2920,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1832},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

So when we add an attachment to a deal, it is stored with the client_id, meaning it should also appear in the client's attachments list (since the client-attachments endpoint queries by `client_id`).\n\nNow let me understand the full picture:\n\n1. **DDP-HDR-04** - When changing a deal's stage, the backend creates a timeline event with `event_type: 'deal_stage_changed'`. The test needs to verify this timeline entry exists in the client's timeline. I can follow the same pattern as DDP-LTK-03: use the API to get client_id, then query the client-timeline endpoint.\n\n\n2. **DDP-ATT-03** - When uploading a link attachment on a deal, it's stored in the `attachments` table with `client_id`. The test needs to verify the attachment appears in the client's attachments list by querying the `client-attachments` endpoint.\n\nFor DDP-HDR-04, I'll extract the dealId from `navigateToFirstDealDetail`, fetch the client_id via API, then after changing the stage, query the client-timeline endpoint to confirm a `deal_stage_changed` entry exists. For DDP-ATT-03, I'll follow a similar approach...\n\nNow I need to check what text format the deals backend uses for stage change descriptions so I can properly validate the timeline event.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":945,"cache_read_input_tokens":47389,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":945,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d8894957-6e05-4b60-84ce-876a2852255a","uuid":"aa6d8413-1319-4b3b-b17e-edd71e373120"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   193→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   194→```\n   195→\n   196→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   197→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   198→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   199→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   200→\n   201→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   202→\n   203→## Directives\n   204→\n   205→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   211→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   212→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   213→\n   214→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   215→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   216→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   217→\n   218→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   219→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   220→\n   221→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   222→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   223→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   224→\n   225→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   226→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   227→\n   228→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   229→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   230→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   231→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   232→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   233→\n   234→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   235→  `npx playwright test` directly.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite.

[2026-02-20T23:44:08.793Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01DHUiEC4ASkbGzWS4JqMqML","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"I can see the steps. The test navigated to a deal with stage \"Lead\" (not \"discovery\" or \"proposal\"). Let me check:\n- Step 11: currentStage from data-value was read\n- Step 16: it clicked on 'deal-header-stage-select-option-discovery', which means the newStage was 'discovery'\n- Step 21: The assertion expected text \"Changed Stage from Lead to Discovery\" \n\nWait, but the `stageDisplayNames` map has: `'lead': 'Lead'`, so `expectedFrom = 'Lead'` and `'discovery': 'Discovery'`, so `expectedTo = 'Discovery'`.\n\n\nThe deal history stores raw stage values in the database, but the DealHistorySection component formats them using display names when rendering. Looking at step 21, it's checking for the text \"Changed Stage from Lead to Discovery\" with an expected count of 1, but the test failed at the count assertion in step 22.\n\nSince the test reached step 22, step 21 must have passed, meaning the history entry was actually rendered. The issue is that step 22 expected `countBefore + 1` entries total, which would be 1 if `countBefore` was 0. But if the deal's initial stage was \"lead\" and we changed it to \"discovery\", there should have been history entries already. Let me trace through what `countBefore` actually was when it was captured in step 12.\n\nThe real problem might be that DDP-HIS-02 is running in parallel and also modifying a deal's stage, potentially adding extra history entries. I need to check if both tests are navigating to the same deal — if DDP-HDR-04 and DDP-HIS-02 are in different test blocks but share the same worker and database, they could be interfering with each other's history counts. The tests ran concurrently—DDP-HIS-02 started at 23:40:31 while DDP-HDR-04 was still executing, so it modified the same deal and inserted history entries that interfered with the count assertion. This looks like a test isolation problem, but I need to check if this failure existed before my changes or if I introduced it.\n\nLooking at the Playwright step details, step 22 expects a count of 1, meaning there should be exactly one history entry after the stage change.

Let me take a different approach. The core issue is the `countBefore + 1` assertion failing because parallel tests on the same deal add extra history entries. This is a pre-existing issue not caused by my changes. \n\nLet me look at this from a different angle. The DDP-HIS-02 test comment at line 387 even acknowledges this: `// (DDP-HDR-04 and DDP-PIP-02 toggle between discovery/proposal on the same deal)`. That's why DDP-HIS-02 uses a different stage (negotiation) to avoid conflicts.\n\n\nBut the real problem is that DDP-HDR-04's assertion checks `countBefore + 1`, which fails when DDP-HIS-02 or DDP-PIP-02 run in parallel and add their own history entries to the same deal. Looking back at the Playwright steps, the deal started in \"lead\" stage, and the test logic toggles between \"discovery\" and \"proposal\" — so it should have moved to \"discovery\" at that point.\n\nAt step 21, the test searched for \"Changed Stage from Lead to Discovery\" and expected exactly 1 history entry. But if DDP-HIS-02 also modified the same deal's stage simultaneously (changing it to negotiation or qualification), there would already be an extra entry in the history by the time DDP-HDR-04 counted, making the assertion fail. stage change would add another entry, making it 2. countBefore + 1 = 2 should match.\n\nThe problem is if DDP-HIS-02 changed the stage BETWEEN DDP-HDR-04's count (step 12) and DDP-HDR-04's final count (step 22). In that case:\n- countBefore at step 12 = 0 (no entries yet)\n- DDP-HIS-02 adds an entry (count becomes 1)\n- DDP-HDR-04 adds an entry (count becomes 2)\n- DDP-HDR-04 expects countBefore + 1 = 1, but actual is 2\n\nLooking at the timings, DDP-HIS-02 started around 23:40:31, which falls right between DDP-HDR-04's initial count check at 23:40:29 and its final count check at 23:40:33. This is a pre-existing race condition where DDP-HIS-02 could have added a history entry in that window, not something my changes introduced. Let me re-run the tests to confirm this failure is intermittent and that the DDP-ATT-03 test passing validates my changes.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":300,"cache_read_input_tokens":82490,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":300,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d8894957-6e05-4b60-84ce-876a2852255a","uuid":"01c3eede-0413-453e-bfb9-52b53436e245"}
