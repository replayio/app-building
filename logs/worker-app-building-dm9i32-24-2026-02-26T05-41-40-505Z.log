A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records.

Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

[2026-02-26T05:38:32.754Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01CihPBrEdejhzsCTjfB3ynd","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have the full CreateReportDialog section from tests.md (lines 559-882). Let me also read the references to CreateReportDialog from other pages (around lines 61-64, 314, 324, 1150-1258).\n\nLet me now systematically check each test entry against the testSpec.md directives.\n\nLet me summarize the **testSpec.md directives**:\n\n1. Images of different pages might not have consistent styling/navigation. Prioritize consistency.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, section. Write test entries for each.\n\n\n3. Don't implement shortcuts—if a table needs computed columns or joined data, test all of them.\n4. Every clickable element needs a clear navigation target or action result specified.\n5. Data mutations require test entries confirming persistence and side effects.\n6. Button and control styling must match the mockup exactly, including text, icons, and appearance.\n7. Modal dialogs need comprehensive testing to ensure they function correctly.\n8. File uploads should be supported unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format.\n10. Backend requirements and API contracts need to be defined.\n11. State changes should propagate throughout the app—timelines, histories, and related entities all need to update.\n\nNow I'm going through the CreateReportDialog test entries to verify they follow these guidelines. The dialog-level tests cover the title, subtitle, close button, layout structure, and cancel functionality, all with clear action results specified. The Generate Report button test confirms the report creation and dialog closure, though I need to check if it fully specifies what happens next.\n\nThe ReportTypeSelector tests look comprehensive—they cover tab display, icons, selection behavior, and preview updates for each type. The DateRangeSelector tests handle date inputs, preset buttons, and manual entry thoroughly. For the AccountCategoryFilter, I'm checking the category tree behavior, expand/collapse functionality, and checkbox interactions including parent-child relationships.\n\nThe ReportPreview tests cover the preview panel, refresh button, table headers, data rows, expand/collapse, links, variances, empty states, and updates when settings change. Now I'm reviewing these against the directives more carefully. The account name link test specifies navigation to AccountDetailPage, which is good, but the ambiguity around whether the dialog closes or opens in a new tab violates the requirement for exact action results. I need to ensure every clickable element specifies precisely what happens, and any data mutations are verified with explicit change assertions. Looking at the rest of the inventory, I'm seeing coverage of the preview panel elements like account names, variance displays, and expandable rows, plus the empty state handling. But I'm noticing a gap: the test for account name links in the preview has vague navigation behavior (\"dialog closes or a new tab opens\"), which violates the requirement for unambiguous navigation targets. I should also check whether the Refresh Preview button has specific behavior tests beyond just appearing in the UI.\n\nNow examining the data consistency across tests more closely—the Rent Expense row shows a variance of -$1,200 with -3.4%, but the math doesn't align. If Rent Expense is $45,000 budgeted versus $47,000 actual, that's a -$2,000 variance, which would be -4.44%, not -3.4%. There's a calculation error in the test data that needs fixing. %, not -3.4%. But this might be test data and not necessarily a directive violation - it's about the spec, not mathematical accuracy. Though it does say the test should verify the data. Actually, wait - this is about realistic test data. The directive says to test for computed values. Having wrong math in the example data doesn't violate a specific directive per se, but having incorrect test values could indicate the test isn't properly specifying what should be verified.\n\nActually, let me re-read the directive: \"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns.\" This is about testing for the presence of columns, not about the accuracy of example data.\n\nLet me look at this from a different angle. What about the \"state-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately\" directive? When a report is generated, does it appear in the ReportList? Yes, the test \"Generate Report button creates report\" verifies this. Are there other places that should update? The spec mentions AccountDetailPage has reporting links, but generating a report probably doesn't need to update those - those are for creating reports, not viewing them.\n\nThe main issue I'm seeing is the ambiguous navigation for account name links - the test says \"The dialog closes (or a new tab/window opens)\" which doesn't specify exactly what happens. I'm also noticing similar \"or\" statements throughout the spec at lines 314 and 324 that leave the navigation targets unclear, which violates the directive about specifying exact behavior. I'm identifying the key violation: the \"ReportPreview account name links\" test is ambiguous about whether the dialog closes or opens in a new tab, which contradicts the directive requiring exact navigation targets. I should also verify whether error handling and backdrop-click tests are actually required by the directives before flagging them as missing.\n\nNow I need to systematically check the component and

Let me systematically work through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecCreateReportDialog\n\nLet me check the testSpec.md directives against the CreateReportDialog test entries:\n\n### Directives to check:\n\n1. **Consistent styling/navigation over exact mockup adherence** - N/A for test entries, this is about prioritizing consistency.\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element** - Let me check if all elements are tested:\n   - Title (\"Create New Report\") ✓\n   - Subtitle ✓\n   - X close button ✓\n   - Two-panel layout ✓\n   - Report Settings title ✓\n   - Report Type selector with 3 tabs ✓\n   - Date Range heading and both date pickers with calendar icons ✓\n   - 3 preset date buttons ✓\n   - Filter Accounts & Categories section with 5 category checkboxes, expand/collapse arrows, and sub-categories ✓\n   - Include Zero Balance toggle ✓\n   - Report Preview title, Refresh button, table with Budget/Actual/Variance/Variance % columns, summary rows, and expandable account rows ✓\n   - Cancel and Generate Report buttons ✓\n\nNow I'm mapping out the exact navigation targets for each interactive element: the X button and Cancel both close the dialog, Generate Report closes it after creating the report, the report type tabs switch between options, preset buttons update the date range, category checkboxes toggle filters, and expand arrows reveal sub-categories.\n\nFor data persistence, I need to verify that Generate Report actually saves the report and displays it in the ReportList page, not just that the dialog closes. I'm also checking that button styles match the specs—primary blue for Generate Report, secondary/outline for Cancel.\n\nLooking at the modal behavior, I see the component handles closing via the X button, Cancel button, and backdrop click, but I should verify there's a test covering the backdrop interaction since the code shows it calls `onClose`.\n\nLet me now identify all the violations I've found so far.\n\nThe first issue is that the account name link test is ambiguous—it says the dialog closes \"or a new tab/window opens,\" but the actual code uses in-page navigation to the AccountDetailPage, so the test should be more specific about what happens.\n\nThe second violation is that there's no test for the overlay backdrop click to close the dialog, which counts as an interactive element that needs testing per the directive.\n\nLooking deeper, I notice the component code is missing JSX comments next to interactive elements that list which tests exercise them—this appears to be a broader issue across all components, not just this one.\n\nLet me refocus on the actual CreateReportDialog test entries in the spec. I'm checking lines 559-882 for violations against the testSpec.md directives. The overlay being clickable to close the dialog needs a test entry, and I should verify whether all interactive elements have proper test coverage documented. Now I'm checking the CreateReportDialog component against the App.md directives, specifically verifying that all interactive elements have proper `data-testid` attributes—the dialog overlay, close button, cancel button, and submit button all have them, but I need to identify what's missing.\n\nLooking at the other components, ReportTypeSelector has good coverage with testids on the container and each tab button, and DateRangeSelector similarly covers the container, date inputs, and preset buttons well.\n\nAccountCategoryFilter is comprehensive with testids for the container, expand buttons, parent and subcategory checkboxes, and the zero-balance toggle. ReportPreview has basic coverage on the container and title, though it could use more testids for the actual preview content.\n\nNow I'm checking the remaining items—the monorepo netlify configuration and database query syntax aren't directly relevant to these component tests, and the last point appears incomplete. strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID** - These components don't do DB operations.\n\n7. **Netlify Functions path index** - Not relevant to these components.\n\n8. **Use searchable select/dropdown for entity references, not plain text** - Not applicable here.\n\n9. **No duplicate navigation links** - Not applicable here.\n\n10. **Never use native `<select>` for filter controls** - The AccountCategoryFilter uses custom checkboxes, and DateRangeSelector uses native `<input type=\"date\">` for date picking rather than filter dropdowns, while ReportTypeSelector uses custom buttons. ✓\n\n11. **Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons** - Not applicable.\n\n12. **Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads** - Not applicable.\n\n13. **Every page component must include consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)** - CreateReportDialog is technically listed as a page in the spec, but it's a modal dialog that handles its own layout differently from actual page components, so this probably doesn't apply.\n\n14. **When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements**\n\nNow I'm checking the test requirements against the actual implementation. The dialog includes the expected subtitle about configuring parameters for financial reports, the \"Report Settings\" title in the left panel, and the two-panel layout with the preview on the right. All the key test expectations are met.\n\n15. **When using neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax** - Not applicable since these components don't query the database.\n\n16. **Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding in component root elements** - The CreateReportDialog's root element uses modal styling as expected, which is appropriate for a modal overlay.\n\nI'm verifying that the other components follow this pattern too - ReportTypeSelector, DateRangeSelector, AccountCategoryFilter, and ReportPreview all have clean root elements without unnecessary padding. That looks good.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the pre-selection from AccountDetailPage works correctly. The test expects that when CreateReportDialog opens from the reporting link, it pre-selects the report type, and the code does this by accepting a `defaultType` prop and initializing state with it. ReportingLinks passes both `defaultType` and `defaultAccountName` to the dialog, which then uses these values to set the initial state.\n\nI notice the account category filter doesn't actually pre-configure based on the account name though - `defaultAccountName` is only used for generating the report name, not for filtering. The test qualifies this with \"may be\" so it's not a hard requirement.\n\nOne more thing I'm checking: when you click an account in the preview, it navigates using React Router, which closes the dialog since they're on different pages. The test entry acknowledges this behavior by saying the dialog closes or opens in a new tab, so that's consistent.\n\nI should verify the visual styling matches the mockup - button variants, icons, badges, and layouts - but without seeing the actual mockup I can't fully validate this. The code structure aligns with what the test describes though.\n\nI'm also looking at the CSS directives, particularly the one about avoiding `overflow: hidden` on containers with absolutely-positioned children, and I notice the code uses inline margin styles in a few places that might need review against the writeApp.md guidelines. I should focus on the substantive violations rather than minor style preferences. Looking at the components more carefully, the `handleAccountClick` function in ReportPreview.tsx navigates away from the page, which effectively closes the dialog by unmounting it—this aligns with the test spec even if it's not an explicit close action. I'm noticing some potential issues with the test specifications themselves that might be worth flagging. The components are properly abstracted into separate files following the pattern, so that directive checks out. Now I'm moving to subtask 3 to review the test coverage for CreateReportDialog—I found one test in accounts-page.spec.ts that verifies the Generate Reports button opens the dialog, but I need to check if the tests align with the writeTests.md directives. Looking at this test, it's verifying that the Generate Reports button in the AccountsOverviewHeader properly triggers the CreateReportDialog to appear, using appropriate test IDs and visibility assertions. The test follows the directive requirements, though it's testing the dialog's visibility from a parent component rather than the dialog's internal behavior.\n\nReconsidering the scope here—the task is to check for directive violations in existing CreateReportDialog tests, but there aren't actually any dedicated tests for the dialog itself. That's not a violation of the test-writing directives; it's just a gap in test coverage that could be addressed separately.\n\nSo my findings are: the testSpec has two issues (ambiguous navigation
