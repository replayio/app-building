[2026-02-20T11:34:19.095Z]   - FixViolationPersonDetailTests: Fix 8 writeTests.md violations in person-detail-page.spec.ts — rename mismatched test titles (PDP-HDR-04, PDP-REL-05, PDP-REL-06, PDP-CH-04, PDP-CH-06, PDP-CH-07) to match spec entries, add missing tests (PDP-REL-08, PDP-CH-08), and implement actual persistence/mutation/filtering assertions instead of UI-only checks
[2026-02-20T11:34:19.095Z]   - RunTests: Verify tests pass after fix

[2026-02-20T11:34:59.659Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_011VkigBkgga6EJmcLosD5pf","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I need to understand the 8 violations. The job description says:\n\n1. **Rename mismatched test titles**: PDP-HDR-04, PDP-REL-05, PDP-REL-06, PDP-CH-04, PDP-CH-06, PDP-CH-07 — these test titles in the spec file don't match the test entries in tests.md\n2. **Add missing tests**: PDP-REL-08, PDP-CH-08\n3. **Implement actual persistence/mutation/filtering assertions** instead of UI-only checks\n\nLet me compare the test titles:\n\n**PDP-HDR-04:**\n\n\nThe spec says \"Cancel edit restores original values\" but tests.md expects \"Saving edited person info persists the change\" — completely opposite behaviors. The spec is testing cancellation while tests.md wants persistence validation.\n\n**PDP-REL-05:**\ntests.md calls for \"Adding a relationship persists and shows in list\" but the spec only checks \"Save is disabled when person ID is empty in Add Relationship modal\" — that's just a validation check, not the persistence test that's actually needed.\n\n**PDP-REL-06:**\nComparing the titles and expected behaviors across both documents to identify the mismatch.\n\n**PDP-CH-04:**\ntests.md wants \"Adding a contact history entry persists and shows in log\" but the spec tests \"Save is disabled when required fields are empty in Add Contact History modal\" — again, validation instead of persistence.\n\n**PDP-CH-06:**\ntests.md expects \"Editing a contact history entry persists the change\" but the spec only verifies \"Cancel button closes the edit modal\" — testing the wrong action entirely.\n\n**PDP-CH-07:**\nBoth documents align on filtering contact history by type.\n\n**PDP-REL-08:**\ntests.md has \"Delete button removes a relationship\" but there's no corresponding spec test — this one's completely missing.\n\n**PDP-CH-08:**\ntests.md has \"Delete button removes a contact history entry\" but again, no spec test exists for it.\n\nLooking at PDP-CH-07 more closely, the titles match but the spec implementation is shallow — it only checks that the dropdown opens and shows an \"All\" option, not that actually selecting \"Email\" filters the entries to show only email-type items.\n\nSo I'm seeing eight distinct violations across these test cases, ranging from mismatched implementations to completely missing tests.\n\nNow I need to look at the actual app components and backend structure to understand what assertions would properly validate these features.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":32453,"cache_read_input_tokens":29024,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":32453,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly.

PDP-REL-05 has a recording ID, but PDP-CH-04 seems to have multiple recording entries with different durations, so I need to figure out which one is valid.\n\nLet me examine the Replay recording for PDP-REL-05 to see what errors occurred during the test.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3690,"cache_read_input_tokens":85867,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3690,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3d8e6a70-d168-4b3d-bffb-cd6361c1acbc","uuid":"62b6098d-3c5b-4d2e-a101-50af6900638d"}
