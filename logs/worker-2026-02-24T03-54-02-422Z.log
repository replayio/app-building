[2026-02-24T03:51:43.700Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01UGEFhLkPDBwC2YZxuLPxPH","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear picture of what the ClientDetailPage looks like. Let me analyze the mockup:\n\n1. **ClientHeader**: Shows \"Acme Corp\" as the name, \"Organization\" badge, \"Active\" status badge, tags (\"Enterprise\", \"Software\", \"High Priority\"), and \"Referral\" with an edit pencil icon. The breadcrumb shows \"ClientDetailPage / /clients/acme-corp-451\".\n\n2. **QuickActions**: Four buttons in the top-right area - \"Add Task\" (list icon), \"Add Deal\" (clock icon), \"Add Attachment\" (paperclip icon), \"Add Person\" (person icon).\n\n\n3. **SourceInfoSection**: Displays source acquisition details including the referral source (John Smith), sales channel (Direct Sales), and acquisition date, with an edit option. **TasksSection**: Lists unresolved tasks with due dates and associated deals, including a completed follow-up task and upcoming items like scheduling an onboarding call and preparing a Q3 review.\n\n4. **DealsSection**: Shows two active deals—the Acme Software License at proposal stage valued at $50,000 and Additional Services in qualification valued at $10,000. **AttachmentsSection**: Contains three attachments with metadata—two documents linked to the Acme deal and a website link—each with download/view and delete options. **PeopleSection**: Beginning to display associated contacts.\n\nNow I'm showing the people involved with this account—Sarah Johnson as CEO, Michael Chen as CTO, and Emily Davis as the project manager, each with their avatar. **TimelineSection**: Displaying a reverse-chronological feed of activities including a task created today, a note from yesterday about client interest, a deal stage change from two days ago, an email sent last week, and contact additions from last month.\n\nLooking at the test format from other pages, I see they follow a BDD pattern with Given/When/Then structure. I'm also reviewing the components section to ensure consistency—there's ClientHeader with name and badges, QuickActions with buttons for adding tasks and deals, SourceInfoSection with acquisition details, TasksSection with unresolved tasks and checkboxes, DealsSection showing deal entries, AttachmentsSection with file management actions, and PeopleSection for team members.\n\nNow I need to write comprehensive test entries for each of these 8 components following the testSpec.md requirements: inventory every visible element, create a test for each one, specify exact navigation targets for clickable items, verify data persistence and side effects, test modals completely, support file uploads for attachments, and ensure state changes propagate across the app. I'll replace the placeholder comment with actual test entries following the established pattern.\n\nLooking at the component structure, I can see ClientHeader displays the client name with type and status badges plus editable tags, QuickActions provides four buttons that each open different forms or dialogs, and SourceInfoSection shows acquisition metadata like source, campaign, channel, and date acquired.\n\nThe remaining sections follow a similar pattern: TasksSection lists unresolved tasks with checkboxes and due dates, DealsSection shows deal entries with stage and value information, AttachmentsSection displays files with download/delete options, PeopleSection lists team members with avatars and roles, and TimelineSection tracks chronological activity entries.\n\nNow I'm setting up the test data for these sections, starting with timeline events that capture various actions like task creation, notes, deal stage changes, and emails with timestamps and user
