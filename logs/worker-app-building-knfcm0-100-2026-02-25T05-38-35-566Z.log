You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports. Budget information is visible or accessible for each account, including an overall budget for the account and budgets for specific items (for example, big or notable expenses), potentially displayed as inline indicators or links to more detailed budget views.\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdjq4Pw1UektSnylW57BEZobPcKpDY4LHifIMz\n     9→\n    10→2.

Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3.

This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

There should be budgets on each account both overall and for specific items (e.g. big expenses) and reports that show actual vs budgeted\n\nPages:\n\n1. AccountsPage (N/A)\n   Description: A main page that lists all accounts grouped under the primary categories: assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses. The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports. Budget information is visible or accessible for each account, including an overall budget for the account and budgets for specific items (for example, big or notable expenses), potentially displayed as inline indicators or links to more detailed budget views.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdjq4Pw1UektSnylW57BEZobPcKpDY4LHifIMz\n\n2. AccountDetailPage (N/A)\n   Description: A detailed view page for a single account that shows all transactions that have affected that account. The layout consists of the account name and category (asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense) at the top, followed by a transaction list or ledger. Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n\n3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n\n4.

Let me analyze what I see:\n\n**ReportDetails page mockup elements:**\n\n1. **Navigation:** Left sidebar with Dashboard, All Reports (highlighted), Budget Planning, Audit Logs. Top nav with \"Acme Finance\" logo, Reports, Budgeting, Settings tabs. Notification bell and user avatar icons.\n\n2. **Breadcrumb:** \"Reports > Q3 2024 Budget Variance Report\"\n\n3. **ReportHeader:** \n   - Title: \"Q3 2024 Budget Variance Report (ID: REP-2024-Q3-001)\"\n   - Export buttons for PDF (outline style) and CSV (primary blue style)\n\n4. **VarianceSummary:** A card displaying the total variance of -$12,500 (9.4%) in red with a down arrow, alongside actual spend of $145,000 and budgeted spend of $132,500, with a mini trend chart on the right.\n\n5. **VarianceChart:** A \"Top Account Variances\" section showing actual versus budgeted comparisons.\n\nNow I'm building a bar chart with paired columns for each account—Marketing, Operations, R&D, Sales, and G&A—where red bars indicate overspending and green bars show underspending relative to budget. The y-axis displays dollar amounts scaled appropriately.\n\n6. **DetailedReportTable:** A comprehensive table with columns for Account/Item, Actual ($), Budget ($), Variance ($), Variance (%), Trend, and Actions, starting with Marketing showing $42,000 actual against $38,000 budgeted.\n\nGenerating the detailed report table... I'm noticing the mockup shows a left sidebar navigation, but since NavBar is already tested in AccountsPage and the skill directives say to prioritize consistent styling over exact image adherence, I'll stick with the established NavBar and focus on the four core components: ReportHeader, VarianceSummary, VarianceChart, and DetailedReportTable. Now I'll work through each subtask to add the test entries systematically.\n\nFor ReportHeader, I need to test the report title with ID display, breadcrumb navigation back to ReportList, and both the PDF and CSV export buttons with their respective download triggers. VarianceSummary should display the total variance with amount and percentage, showing negative variance in red with a down arrow, and I'll continue mapping out the remaining test cases for the other components. The detailed table shows individual line items under each account with variance displayed as negative values in red with parentheses or positive in green, plus sparkline charts in the trend column and view buttons for navigation. I'm now double-checking the math on the variance summary—the actual spend of $145,000 against a budget of $132,500 should show a positive variance, not the negative $12,500 I'm seeing in the mockup.\n\nActually, I realize the variance is calculated as budgeted minus actual (the traditional accounting approach), so $132,500 - $145,000 = -$12,500, which represents overspending. The percentage checks out too: $12,500 / $132,500 ≈ 9.4%. Looking at the bar chart, Marketing and Operations show red bars above the zero line indicating they're over budget, while Sales and G&A have green bars below zero showing they're under budget.\n\nNow examining the detailed breakdown, I see the individual line items under each account. The numbers in the Operations section seem a bit off—Cloud Infrastructure shows $8,500 actual against a $5,000 budget with a -$3,500 variance, and Office Lease is right on budget at $6,000. Some of the percentages look like placeholder data that doesn't quite add up mathematically, but I can work with the structure to understand how the accounts are being itemized.\n\nLet me start writing out the test cases systematically to cover all the scenarios this budget dashboard needs to handle. a PDF file, and the CSV button downloads a CSV file. The report title should reflect the specific report's name and ID from the database.\n\nFor VarianceSummary, I'm checking that the total variance displays with dollar amount and percentage, with red styling and a down arrow for negative variance and green with an up arrow for positive variance. The actual and budgeted spend amounts should both be visible, along with a mini trend chart on the right side of the summary card.\n\nFor VarianceChart, I need to verify the \"Top Account Variances\" heading and \"Actual vs. Budgeted\" subtitle appear, and that the bar chart renders paired bars comparing actual versus budgeted amounts for each account.\n\nNow I'm looking at the DetailedReportTable to ensure it displays the proper column headers, account rows with expand/collapse functionality to reveal sub-items, and that variance amounts are color-coded with red for negative values and appropriate styling for percentages.
