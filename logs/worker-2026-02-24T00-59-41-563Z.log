There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other.

Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links.

The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0d639e17-4d33-4bca-895c-be33327e6d59","uuid":"a697afb1-7115-4ae6-968b-e05f2dcbc853","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

I need to write comprehensive test entries for it. Let me review the key requirements from AppRevisions.md: Email Notifications has 7 toggleable preferences (client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added) that default to enabled and are only visible when authenticated, stored in the notification_preferences table. Import & Export provides buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, plus export clients.\n\nNow I'm looking at the Webhooks section, which requires full CRUD operations with an add/edit modal containing name, URL, and event checkboxes, plus enable/disable toggles and delete confirmations. The Webhook Setup Guides need platform-specific instructions for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints with step-by-step guidance, URL format hints, and toggleable payload sections that update based on the selected platform.\n\nI'll structure the test entries using BDD format grouped by component, testing every interactive element with exact navigation targets for buttons, complete modal dialog flows, and backend integrations that include the full setup instructions visible in the config UI.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":17104,"cache_read_input_tokens":26497,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":17104,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0d639e17-4d33-4bca-895c-be33327e6d59","uuid":"56b89529-64ca-4703-a931-baa08b600f6c"}

See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    12→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    13→  the work currently being done.\n    14→\n    15→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    16→external services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n    17→\n    18→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    19→\n    20→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n    21→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    22→2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n    23→3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    24→   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    25→\n    26→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    27→matching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    28→\n    29→## Worker Execution\n    30→\n    31→The worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\n    32→it passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    33→\n    34→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    36→\n    37→The worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\n    38→jobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    39→\n    40→When you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    41→\n    42→## Job System\n    43→\n    44→Work is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\n    45→with a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\n    46→and a `timestamp`:\n    47→\n    48→```json\n    49→{\n    50→  \"groups\": [\n    51→    {\n    52→      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    53→      \"jobs\": [\n    54→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    55→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    57→      ],\n    58→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    59→    }\n    60→  ]\n    61→}\n    62→```\n    63→\n    64→The agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n    65→\n    66→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n    67→  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n    68→  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n    69→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    70→\n    71→All jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\n    72→all checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\n    73→sub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    74→\n    75→**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n    76→\n    77→- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    78→  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    79→- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n    80→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    81→- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n    82→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    83→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n    84→- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n    85→\n    86→## Tech Stack\n    87→\n    88→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    89→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    90→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    91→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    92→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    93→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    94→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    95→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    96→\n    97→## Database\n    98→\n    99→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   100→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   101→frontend components.\n   102→\n   103→## Quality Gates\n   104→\n   105→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   106→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   107→\n   108→## Commits\n   109→\n   110→The worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\n   111→explicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n   112→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01RwbxGShDEbaCi2t4eRACyJ","session_id":"0d639e17-4d33-4bca-895c-be33327e6d59","uuid":"c8859767-3a30-4749-8e4b-9f44e66cc71b"}
