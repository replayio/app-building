Now let me analyze them for shell commands:\n\n**Log 1** (worker-app-building-7732cy-1): This was the initial setup log - it queued report tasks. Shell commands used:\n- `ls /repo/skills/messages/` - listing skill files\n- `echo \"BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)\" && echo \"TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)\"` - getting branch/timestamp\n- `npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts` (multiple times) - adding tasks to queue\n\n\n- Logs 10 and 11 both ran AnalyzeGroup operations for test failures, creating the same report directory and repeatedly executing the log reading command across multiple iterations.\n\nContinuing through logs 12 and 13, which follow the same pattern—setting up the reports directory and running the log reader ten times each. I'm working through the remaining logs to see what comes next.","signature":"EoQMCkYICxgCKkAULPxiT26vM54y573XEJH9IeVOZsbd2TGZQcEtuawj/UHrWPgAbe/iA5HQzdDsItxHUUrCv+3DzQJ0DSb8GcfNEgyHwpDXAHotrhUFI+MaDD35ylTzADU2ikJ3nSIw0lxImBmQhoe8wVnNeqV75vor4dG39AiSEFE4s9qaHv+Rfnt5MIf9/Xabr0YHqAHSKusKPGhM+hJqEWYUmlOoysC97U89knLBSwBOs+fJdHeJQU8kp4WAx4Za10TayQ7Jp3QGiDqRdSkmU7i9KeHU+jfq4GYJ2twv0ap9RUWsUpNr7TQzrXslNjnBIpMgiJctucUjYtKEwrdd1prF9/nO7rWzhoRcU1e4esVltgA/MsAQ7FTmEclGv/h4YsI7zeoLjEud075Cx2bEykPQZxG0IVTwlcVooUHY3B2KVH63aLC0kn5aAACy6RkYqnuzVf6qT10ZTRrrsbkjsxBSNf9rWtK4H+BvYkWDcJun9ypkWQBOJduwTiyPCuhxO8T/YbZUhveNrVLrBXxt+0s93bMKjQdrpsrf/WPY5dx0fyyYDuC2vvejqoJOU9PeLhAzHcoli4Ytpv8QTlyohjq16hwDgmA+BUA3/Z0FfXd3IqvsWTaWwbwgXOFBU9SOxVnsnFhcFeEbEqnMitgLrZBsp2rPS11oFj8MfDVIH0omMk74ef9es2sFCIBcqfLeZJhH7JQWmcRbD9C0UDkmb/Yk5NT/gj4CHa6cOw0ON3Uuw3vyWK/HB8TnRv/TAQ8DTp3mxyzCO44Zu+84sdaIKq6Jjo2MpWNGPuxv7rpMUf5JXNwE745yQiCgl+TcOGL4M0Oqeirdl6tv0shlqnw07clNCRsZ7HVKHoqUOkj5wRYNRuhUyN5uZbDojOLmU9hB64UpQ34tzHkopW2QPBr3rk66/5gN11F+hel7UFSlRvShPbpZsATI/Dh4kUI1BBtcsRqAEZDxAVOezn6/TZaXPSO7VjlCcmNnkssKePlPGFTt95E/D9I4XOQVEgDePLeJZN2aYCUN0DRrUTSRGaGzd5vWEgoRHfIesFHa90yvNiqlyGKsHw8tZTt8HpSzrL6mfr2F6tq+jS26TYgd0/J599gL96p5rzjgwqwUTd0VFs2PAAamuCwP32NTsiAQRYeB8wIqJn0Tbbe+5GHtlnj6OtwzfWsK+oG4MOJNldt3UbHSBrqvqJSN5vCjbCxOBbp8HRzF51BBZGUvFNCpb1nNzCisLOv8Qnf+NDzK1UzZPwwoOhsS4Fxkn1ENpxv557A2of1wLG05RPK3jnHGyx7lj7SjbD06TZ4gBpSw7rGMevpd6MUWGbghzbHehMONssNfAGpiEIRYbaLVotMnWwSRxBdtmX9ea3klWInZE4Kby4hZQRDUuZkm+wE6OutVJybknrYxekRIxhKv9scu4cBmfUiSRJadfYk/Q1dDwUfIJ8zBeqxwR4uSYypXtSbZMbGqDUpQSjR4fJutB3+F9qEGFrAj/0JIEKnqqS41wJAVU9xJEe6sPmF37xblMTSY9W4bJImGNclIyaavNecolmngnnNI4e8BX3qB1xhl9driNaf+sQXjs7D2y2iRskgUC0hfWw4Olb8eU9Q/Bt1o/diL9IIkICGmqcmtPCmY5SXbD8xdnVijkClBU6cekc43ZRESxwl+Di12oAk0qmtGuED7oN5+PmKqey7/stK2SJtfVgQkuG8pkysfD1khiukyE2sQbIiW9cdm8QIYezCZynwQuLszyQQCCmb1dMk6/1zc4Kl+7yq+riVkuZvxWBdO96u2Wlq6DsjhtekZJn1kGezxPHtYfwossE6Qq+ueQfJq4KrzQ+XCrCF8JTpXNtZ2t7HRIt5oNKHCWSo12CUzeEnkYkN/a+CYtJ/JiO0dsdtupj2uuH2qvWu4YZLUxs3Ja3jRFAyoHKe9oCGEE8gnmjy/mZm1WCTHhQMLwexWt5tls7cBLwDCu5L0+U8OzJcfcu54kHyMCRzsfWFYuHAmF18bs91yRv35rQpzWQqscq1L51TUCFqGkrWqjuAf/f9CLU7qusnvPhgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":23398,"cache_read_input_tokens":29093,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":23398,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"10343fb0-8026-416b-84d1-2865985531a5","uuid":"ad6608e0-dbc2-455f-a989-1ca2a89fdd18"}
