You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me inventory every visible element:\n\n**Header (BatchHeader)**:\n- \"Batch: BATCH-12345\" as large heading\n- Material: \"Organic Arabica Coffee Beans\"\n- Account: \"Global Imports Inc.\"\n- Status: \"Active\" with green dot\n- \"Created: 2023-10-27 at 10:30 AM\" badge\n- \"Originating Transaction: TX-PROD-987\" badge\n- \"+ Create New Transaction\" button (filled blue, primary)\n\n**Batch Overview (BatchOverview)**:\n\n\nThe overview section displays the current quantity and properties—1500 kg stored in Warehouse A, Zone 4, with lot number LOT-2023-OCB and an expiration date of 2024-10-27. Additional details include the Premium quality grade and Climate Controlled storage condition, each with their own icon indicators.\n\n**Lineage (LineageDiagram)**:\nNow I'm looking at the lineage section, which traces back to the source transaction.\n\nThe source transaction TX-PROD-987 shows the inputs that went into creating this batch—raw coffee cherries from a farm co-op (1800 kg) and washing water from facility supplies (5000 L)—flowing through a washing and processing step dated 2023-10-27 to produce the current batch of organic Arabica coffee beans for Global Imports Inc.\n\n**Usage History**\n\nNow I'm looking at the transaction history for this batch, which tracks all the movements and transformations it's undergone since production. The table shows several outbound transactions including a packaging operation that split it into two new batches, a roasting process that consumed 800 kg, and an inventory adjustment.\n\nI can see the sidebar navigation is consistent with what I expected, and I've already got the component list defined in my tests. So I need to structure out the test file with sections for each component and then fill in the actual test cases for BatchHeader, CreateNewTransactionButton, BatchOverview, LineageDiagram, and UsageHistoryTable.\n\nLooking at the mockup, I'm mapping out what each component should test - the BatchHeader needs to verify the batch ID display, material name, account info, status badge, dates, and the originating transaction link. BatchOverview should cover the properties section with all its fields like quantity, unit, location, lot number, expiration date, quality grade, and storage condition. Then I'll need to define tests for the LineageDiagram and the other components.\n\nFor the LineageDiagram, I'm checking that the lineage section heading appears, the source transaction displays with its ID as a clickable link, the inputs section shows all input batches with their details and clickable links, the visual flow diagram renders correctly with arrows, the output section shows this batch's information, and navigation works when clicking batch IDs. I also need to test the edge case where a batch has no source transaction.\n\nFor UsageHistoryTable, I'm verifying the section heading, all table columns render correctly with Date & Time, Transaction ID, Type, Movement direction, Amount with unit, and Created Batches, plus the data populates accurately in each row.\n\nFor the remaining table tests, I need to check that Transaction IDs and Created Batches are clickable with proper navigation, the Movement column displays In/Out correctly, empty cells show \"-\" when there are no created batches, rows appear in reverse chronological order, and
