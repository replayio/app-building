See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `strategy`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `tasks.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same strategy. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

Let me analyze it:\n\n**AccountsPage mockup shows:**\n- Page title \"Accounts\" at the top\n- Breadcrumb: \"Home / Accounts\"\n- Sidebar navigation: Dashboard, Inventory (expandable), Orders, Accounts (highlighted), Reports (expandable), Settings\n\n**Three sections:**\n\n1. **Stock Accounts** section with \"+ Create Stock Account\" button\n   - Table columns: Account Name, Account Type, Description, Actions\n   - Rows:\n     - Main Inventory | Stock (Default) | Primary storage for all physical goods. | Eye, Edit (pencil), Archive (trash) icons\n     - Raw Materials | Stock | Components for manufacturing. | Eye, Edit, Archive icons\n     - Finished Goods | Stock | Completed products ready for sale. | Eye, Edit, Archive icons\n     - Safety Stock | Stock | Buffer inventory for emergencies. | Eye, Edit, Archive icons\n\n2. **Input Accounts** section with \"+ Create Input Account\" button\n   - Same table structure with columns for Account Name, Account Type, Description, and Actions\n   - Rows include Purchases (General account for acquiring stock), Vendor Credits (Credits received from suppliers), and Shipping Costs (Inbound) for freight expenses\n\n3. **Output Accounts** section with \"+ Create Output Account\" button\n   - Same columns as above\n   - Rows include Sales Revenue (Income from product sales), Service Income (Revenue from non-product services), Customer Discounts (Reductions given to customers), and a partially visible Returns/Damages entry\n   - Each row has Eye, Edit, and Archive action icons\n\nNow I'm planning out the component structure and thinking through what test data I'll need to populate these account sections.\n\nI've identified the key components I need to work with: the three account list components for Stock, Input, and Output accounts, plus the create button and row action handlers. For testing, I should create entries that cover the main account types visible in the mockup, test the create functionality for each section, verify the row actions work properly with View/Edit/Archive flows, and also include tests for the breadcrumb navigation and page heading since those are part of the interface. The spec clarifies that each category (stock, input, output) comes with one default account, though users can create custom ones—and the mockup shows this by labeling defaults with \"(Default)\" in the Account Type column. I need to write comprehensive tests starting with the page structure, then move through each component, though I'm realizing the breadcrumb and heading might need their own test coverage depending on how the component list is organized. Looking at the existing components for AccountsPage—StockAccountsList, InputAccountsList, OutputAccountsList, CreateAccountButton, and AccountRowActions—I need to decide if I should add a header component for the breadcrumb and heading. Since AccountDetailPage uses an AccountHeader component, I should follow that pattern and add an AccountsPageHeader for consistency, then document these sections in the test spec. I'm realizing I need to include AccountsPageHeader in the components list and add its tests directly in PlanPageAccounts since there's no separate subtask for it, then let the remaining subtasks handle the component-specific test entries for the lists, buttons, and row actions. there's no separate subtask for it. Or I could include the section headings as part of the individual list components.\n\nI think the cleanest approach is:\n- Add breadcrumb/heading tests as part of PlanPageAccounts (under an AccountsPageHeader subsection)\n- StockAccountsList, InputAccountsList, OutputAccountsList get their table tests\n- CreateAccountButton gets its button tests\n- AccountRowActions gets its action tests\n\nLet me now write this all out. First, the PlanPageAccounts part (structure + header tests), then I'll do each component subtask.\n\nActually, let me re-read the instructions. The subtask says:\n1. PlanPageAccounts: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md for AccountsPage (/accounts)\n2. PlanComponentAccountCategoryLists: Add test entries for StockAccountsList, InputAccountsList, OutputAccountsList\n3. PlanComponentCreateAccountButton: Add test entries for Create Stock/Input/Output Account buttons\n4. PlanComponentAccountRowActions: Add test entries for account row click navigation, View/Edit/Archive action icons, and edit/archive confirmation flows\n\nSo for subtask 1, I need to decide on the final component list and add section headings to tests.md, plus any page-level tests like breadcrumb and heading since no component subtask covers those. For subtask 2, I'll add the actual test entries for the three list components. Now I'm going through the mockup to inventory every element I need to test, starting with the sidebar navigation, page heading, breadcrumb, and account creation buttons. I'm finishing up the Output Accounts section with Sales Revenue, Service Income, Customer Discounts, and a fourth partially visible row, each with their action icons. Clicking any row should navigate to that account's detail page. Now I'm planning out the test cases for the page structure—starting with the header that shows the breadcrumb navigation and page title, then moving through the Stock Accounts list with its table layout and default account indicator, followed by the Input Accounts section. - \"Input Accounts\" section heading is displayed\n- Table displays column headers: Account Name, Account Type, Description, Actions\n- Table shows input accounts with correct data (Purchases as default, Vendor Credits, Shipping Costs Inbound)\n- Default account is indicated with \"(Default)\" in Account Type column\n- Empty state when no input accounts exist\n\n### OutputAccountsList\n- \"Output Accounts\" section heading is displayed\n- Table displays column headers: Account Name, Account Type, Description, Actions\n- Table shows output accounts with correct data (Sales Revenue as default, Service Income, Customer Discounts)\n- Default account is indicated with \"(Default)\" in Account Type column\n- Empty state when no output accounts exist\n\n### CreateAccountButton\nEach section has a create button with a plus icon that opens a form with Account Name and Description fields. Submitting saves the new account while canceling dismisses the form without creating anything.\n\n### AccountRowActions\nClicking an account row or the view icon navigates to its detail page, the edit icon opens a pre-filled form to modify the account, and the archive icon triggers a confirmation dialog before marking it as archived—though default accounts can't be
