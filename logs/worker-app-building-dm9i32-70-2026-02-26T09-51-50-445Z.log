There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01PaLFpc1fSBxkDbNYuT3oLB","session_id":"73f13db2-13a8-4432-8aeb-768588c5e4a3","uuid":"da846df4-f9d4-417b-8eab-60ec88532493"}

Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   153→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   154→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   155→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   156→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01PaLFpc1fSBxkDbNYuT3oLB","session_id":"73f13db2-13a8-4432-8aeb-768588c5e4a3","uuid":"e8a0c019-48fe-41d8-ad40-4d5a4bff0eb4"}

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01PaLFpc1fSBxkDbNYuT3oLB","session_id":"73f13db2-13a8-4432-8aeb-768588c5e4a3","uuid":"de6c62d9-4552-4dae-adc7-5d304d77428c"}

Key sections:\n\n**Unpack Subtasks:** Create setup task, then write component/page tasks\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Write clean, working code with no TODOs or placeholders\n- Abstract all JSX into React components\n- Check AppStyle.md files (shared and app-specific) for styling\n- Use reusable code from `apps/shared`\n- Set up app build to use shared code\n\n**Database Schema Requirements:**\n- Must have reusable `initSchema` function from shared module\n- Function accepts database URL and returns Promise\n- Must NOT read DATABASE_URL from environment\n- Use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency\n- Add all tables, indices, and constraints\n- Separate migration logic for ALTER TABLE changes\n\n**Directives:**\n- Run `npm run check` from app directory\n- Identify test entries relevant to components\n- Match visual appearance to mockups\n- Include `data-testid` on interactive elements\n- Set `base = \"apps/AppName\"` in netlify.toml\n- Use tagged template syntax for neon serverless queries\n- Convert empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns\n- Use searchable select for entity relationships\n- Remove duplicate navigation links\n- Use custom dropdown components instead of native HTML select\n- File-type-specific icons for attachments\n- Working file upload mechanisms for attachments\n- Consistent padding on page root elements\n- Source maps and readable React names in production\n- Plan complete data flow before writing\n- Use Write for >50% file modifications instead of multiple Edits\n- Add useEffect for useState prop sync\n- Only show loading indicators on initial load\n- Await async operations before closing edit mode\n- Include delete buttons for DELETE operations\n- Define domain colors as CSS variables\n- Layout-agnostic components (no outer padding/margin)\n\n---\n\n### 4. `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md` (Complete Skill File)\n\nInstructions for writing Playwright tests. Key sections:\n\n**Unpack Subtasks:** Add one task per page for test entries\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Write Playwright tests matching test entry requirements\n- Don't run tests but ensure they should pass\n- Test title must match test entry title\n- Finish any incomplete app implementations\n- Use data-testid for element identification\n\n**Directives:**\n- Verify navigation targets precisely (assert URL or content)\n- Interact with components on each page they appear\n- Verify side effects happen exactly once\n- Avoid getByText() with common words (use getByTestId or getByRole)\n- Keep data-testid values consistent across files\n- Exercise actual file upload mechanics\n- Never put Playwright locator calls inside toPass() retry blocks\n- No unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach\n- Use generous timeouts (30000ms for backend operations)\n- Use test.slow() for multi-step flows\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/`\n- For deployment tests: match testid values, handle empty states, use generous timeouts\n- Each field mentioned in spec entry must be tested\n- Full auth e2e tests required\n- Auth flow email verification tests need real production code path\n\n**Parallel Test Design:**\n- Tests in same spec file share database branch\n- Don't rely on fixed record counts\n- Create own test data in beforeAll/beforeEach\n- Never hardcode database IDs\n- Use fullyParallel: true\n- Use replayDevices['Replay Chromium'] not standard Chrome\n- Set timeout to at least 60000ms (Replay has overhead)\n\n**Tips:**\n- Read shared component source to verify testid values\n- Plan all testid additions upfront\n- Read Netlify function, page component, 2-3 section components\n- Handle Playwright browser install permission errors\n- Use generous timeouts for cold database connections\n\n---\n\nThis completes the full retrieval of all requested files from the SalesCRM application directory and the skill files for building, testing, and specification."}],"totalDurationMs":46390,"totalTokens":80008,"totalToolUseCount":19,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2344,"cache_read_input_tokens":75814,"output_tokens":1848,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2344},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

You will build and/or maintain one or more\n     4→web apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n     5→\n     6→Key directories:\n     7→\n     8→* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n     9→* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n    10→* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n    24→3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    25→   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    26→\n    27→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    28→matching skill.

For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    39→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    40→\n    41→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    42→\n    43→## Task System\n    44→\n    45→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    67→\n    68→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n    69→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    98→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    99→\n   100→## Database\n   101→\n   102→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   103→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   104→frontend components.\n   105→\n   106→## Quality Gates\n   107→\n   108→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`).

I've found and read the complete DealDetailPage section from the tests.md file. Here is the complete DealDetailPage section with all test entries:\n\n## Complete DealDetailPage Section\n\n**File:** /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md\n**Lines:** 1220-1511\n\n### DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)\n\n#### Components: DealHeader, DealStagePipeline, DealHistorySection, DealMetricsSection, WriteupsSection, LinkedTasksSection, DealAttachmentsSection, ContactsIndividualsSection\n\n#### DealHeader\n\n1. **Deal title displays deal name with client name and value** - Given the user navigates to /deals/:dealId for a deal named \"Expansion Deal\" associated with client \"Acme Corp\" valued at $250k, the page displays a heading \"DEAL DETAILS: Acme Corp - $250k Expansion Deal\" at the top of the content area showing the client name, formatted value, and deal name.\n\n2. **Client field displays associated client name** - Given the user is viewing a deal associated with client \"Acme Corporation\", the header displays a \"Client:\" label followed by the client name \"Acme Corporation\" in an editable text field.\n\n3. **Client field is clickable and navigates to client detail page** - Given the user is viewing a deal associated with \"Acme Corporation\", when they click on the client name field, the app navigates to /clients/:clientId for that client and the ClientDetailPage is displayed.\n\n4. **Value field displays deal monetary value** - Given the user is viewing a deal with value $250,000, the header displays a \"Value:\" label followed by \"$250,000\" in an editable text field.\n\n5. **Value field can be edited inline** - Given the user is viewing a deal with value \"$250,000\", when they click the Value field and change it to \"$300,000\" and confirm, the value is updated in the database and the header reflects \"$300,000\". The deal title also updates to reflect the new value.\n\n6. **Owner field displays deal owner as user dropdown** - Given the user is viewing a deal owned by \"Sarah Lee\", the header displays an \"Owner:\" label followed by a FilterSelect dropdown showing \"Sarah Lee\", populated with team members from the users API.\n\n7. **Owner field can be changed via dropdown** - Given the user is viewing a deal owned by \"Sarah Lee\", when they open the Owner dropdown and select \"Mike R.\", the deal owner is updated to \"Mike R.\" in the database and the header reflects the new owner.\n\n8. **Changing owner creates a timeline entry on the client** - Given the user changes the deal owner from \"Sarah Lee\" to \"Mike R.\" and saves, a timeline entry is created on the associated client recording the owner change, attributed to the current user (or \"System\" if unauthenticated).

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"73f13db2-13a8-4432-8aeb-768588c5e4a3","uuid":"cfe9a16f-95c5-4715-97fa-73edd2372416","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing a complete, detailed test specification for an app based on an initial app specification\nin `AppSpec.md`.

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. **Don't substitute easier elements**: If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four.\n4. **Exact navigation targets**: For every clickable element, specify the exact navigation target or action result. Don't leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\n5. **User actions that mutate data**: Write test entries verifying persistence and side effects (history/timeline entries, exactly one per action).\n6. **Button and control appearance**: If a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, test entry should verify that appearance.\n7. **Completely test modal dialogs**: Modal dialogs must work properly.\n8. **Attachment functionality**: Should support file uploads.\n9. **Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format**: Test entries should verify format documentation is visible.\n10. **Backend integrations**: Must include complete setup instructions.\n11. **State-changing actions**: Must test that other app parts update. History/timeline entries for mutations. Reciprocal relationships must be in sync.\n\nNow I'm going through each test entry for DealHeader to verify it aligns with these requirements, checking that navigation targets are explicit, mutations create history entries, and all visual elements match the mockup specifications. Moving on to DealStagePipeline, I'm verifying all six stages display in order with the current stage marked, completed stages showing filled checkmarks, and future stages showing empty ones. The progress bar segments update correctly when stages change, and the pipeline properly recognizes Lead as the starting point and Closed Won as the final stage. Now checking DealHistorySection...\n\nthe stage change entries follow the exact format specified, appear in reverse chronological order, and correctly attribute changes to the user who made them, with an empty state when there's no history. For DealMetricsSection, both the probability percentage and expected close date are editable fields that persist changes, and the system handles N/A values appropriately when metrics aren't set.\n\nNow I'm checking the WriteupsSection, which includes a new entry button with a plus icon, individual writeup cards displaying the title in bold along with date and author information, and content text. Each writeup has an edit button with a pencil icon that opens edit mode, and saving changes creates a version history entry. There's also a version history button to review past edits.\n\nFor the new entry form, it validates required fields, allows submission to create an entry that persists and generates exactly one timeline entry while triggering follower notifications, and includes a cancel option that closes without saving. The empty state is also accounted for.\n\nMoving into the LinkedTasksSection now, checking the section title, add task button, and how both uncompleted and completed tasks are formatted. Now checking the DealAttachmentsSection test cases - all the attachment handling looks solid, from upload modals and file displays through to deletion confirmations and cross-entity verification.\n\nI'm reconsidering directive 9 about import/upload dialogs specifying expected data formats. The attachment upload here is just a general file upload that accepts any file type, not a structured data import like CSV, so that directive probably doesn't apply. The test entries don't specify file type restrictions, but that seems appropriate for a generic attachment feature.\n\nMoving on to the ContactsIndividualsSection tests now.\n\nI'm noticing a potential gap: the writeup section has Edit and Version History buttons, but no Delete button. The writeApp.md directive requires delete buttons when the backend supports DELETE operations, though I need to verify if that applies to this particular test specification.\n\nI'm also catching an inconsistency with entry 54 - it only documents title validation in the test spec, but the actual component code validates both title and content fields. The directive mentions testing modal dialogs comprehensively, so this discrepancy might be worth flagging during the component review. Looking at the edit form validation, the component code doesn't actually validate anything—it just saves directly. So that's probably not an issue. But I'm noticing something else: the test entries describe \"Edit\" and \"Version History\" buttons with text labels, yet the actual component only renders icons with title attributes, no visible text. That's a potential mismatch between what the tests claim and what's actually displayed.\n\nI also see that the writeup creation form requires both title and content, but the validation test only covers the title field. And thinking about the testSpec.md directive to completely test modal dialogs—if the modal has required fields, shouldn't all of them be validated in the tests?\n\nLet me step back and focus on actual directive violations rather than getting caught up in minor inconsistencies. Going through the checklist: styling and navigation look consistent, I've inventoried the visible elements, navigation targets are precise, mutation constraints are specified, button appearances are detailed. The main potential gap is that modal testing directive—the writeup form requires content validation but the test entry doesn't mention it.\n\nNow I'm checking what the DealHeader actually covers. The test entry describes the heading with deal details, and looking at the code, I can see the title, client field, value field, and owner field are all tested.\n\nFor the stage field and Change Stage button, those are covered in entries 9-14. Moving through the other sections—DealStagePipeline, DealHistorySection, DealMetricsSection, WriteupsSection, LinkedTasksSection, DealAttachmentsSection, and ContactsIndividualsSection—they all appear to have their key elements tested: buttons, modals, interactive elements, and display components.\n\nThe test spec seems pretty comprehensive overall. Let me think about what might be missing...\n\nI notice the edit form validation isn't explicitly tested, but looking at the actual component code, the edit form doesn't have validation logic anyway, so there's nothing to test there. Entry 54 covers create form validation, which aligns with the directive about thoroughly testing modal dialogs.\n\nActually, I'm noticing a potential discrepancy in entry 44—it describes an \"Edit\" button with a pencil icon and text, but the component only renders an SVG icon without any text label. That's worth flagging as an inconsistency between what the test entry claims and what's actually in the code. I'm noticing the writeup form spec only tests title validation, but the code requires both title and content to be filled in. The directive about completely testing modal dialogs suggests content validation should be verified too, though this feels like a minor gap rather than a clear violation. The content field validation gap is the only testSpec.md directive violation I can identify. Now let me check the timeline and reciprocal relationships directive more carefully—looking through the test entries, I can see owner changes, stage changes, value edits, metrics edits, writeup creation, and task completion all have corresponding timeline entries documented, so that directive appears to be covered. Looking at the directive more carefully, the import/upload requirement seems aimed at data imports with specific schemas rather than general file attachments, so the attachment upload not listing accepted types should be fine. I'm now checking whether all visible elements in the component are actually tested—the code shows file-type-specific icons for different attachment formats, which the writeApp.md directive mentions but testSpec.md doesn't explicitly require testing, though it does call for systematically inventorying visible elements.\n\nSince I can't verify against the actual mockup, I'll note this as a potential gap but not flag it as a definitive violation. Overall, the test entries are solid and align well with the directives, though I notice the form validation testing only covers the title field and doesn't extend to other inputs.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the form validation more carefully. The writeup form requires both title and content, but entry 54 only tests what happens when title is missing. That's incomplete coverage of the validation requirements, which violates the directive about thoroughly testing modal dialogs. That's a real issue I should flag.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the component code against the writeApp.md directives. Now I'm going through each component to verify they follow the directives—DealDetailPage has the correct padding and test IDs, while DealHeader properly uses custom FilterSelect dropdowns for owner and stage filtering instead of native HTML selects.\n\nDealStagePipeline and DealHistorySection both have appropriate test IDs on their containers and child elements. I'm checking DealMetricsSection next to ensure it has the same coverage.\n\nLooking at the async operations in the metrics and header sections, they're all properly awaiting the dispatch calls before closing edit mode. WriteupsSection has test IDs throughout, proper modal structure, form validation, and version history tracking.\n\nNow checking the remaining sections—LinkedTasksSection uses FilterSelect for dropdowns with searchable assignee options and proper form validation, DealAttachmentsSection handles file uploads with type-specific icons and delete confirmation, and ContactsIndividualsSection navigates correctly to individual detail pages.\n\nFor the React patterns, DealHeader properly syncs both selectedStage and selectedOwner with useEffect when props change, and DealMetricsSection handles probability and close date inputs correctly since they're set on user interaction rather than initialized from props.\n\nNow I'm checking the layout directives—verifying that components don't have outer padding or margin classes. DealHeader and DealStagePipeline are clean, but I need to verify the CSS for DealHistorySection and the other detail-section components to ensure they follow the layout-agnostic pattern.\n\nFor the delete button requirement, I'm checking which resources support DELETE operations in the backend. Attachments have delete functionality, but writeups don't have a delete button yet—I need to verify if the backend supports that operation.\n\nI'm also reviewing how date values are handled across components, particularly checking whether empty strings are being converted to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID fields as required. `var(--text-disabled)` and other CSS variables are being used correctly throughout the components. Now I need to check the backend to see if there are any DELETE operations the UI doesn't expose, and verify that empty strings are being converted to null before database operations. I need to verify the data-testid attributes across the DealDetailPage components to ensure they meet the writeApp.md requirements. Looking at DealHeader, I can see it has the necessary test IDs for the container, title, interactive elements like buttons and inputs, and the FilterSelect components for owner and stage selection.\n\nNow I'm checking the remaining components—DealStagePipeline has test IDs for the container, individual stages, and progress bar segments, while DealHistorySection covers the container, empty state, list, and individual history entries. For DealMetricsSection, I'm verifying the test IDs for the metrics containers and their input fields. Finishing up the writeup section elements, but I'm noticing the cancel buttons in the modals are missing data-testid attributes—I need to check the create modal, edit modal, and versions modal to see which ones need to be added. button (line 269): no data-testid\n- Add task modal cancel button (line 192): no data-testid\n- Attachment upload modal cancel button (line 200): no data-testid\n\nThe directive requires data-testid on all interactive elements, and cancel buttons definitely qualify. While tests could work around this using role or text queries, the requirement is explicit. I'm also noticing the modal close buttons lack testids—checking the WriteupsSection, those X buttons at lines 194 and 241 don't have them either. Beyond the cancel buttons, the writeup edit save button at line 139 and its corresponding cancel button at line 136 are also missing testids. So there's a pattern here across multiple modals where both the action buttons and close mechanisms need these attributes. Looking at the save buttons more carefully, the one in WriteupsSection at line 139 is definitely a primary action that tests would need to target, so that's worth adding a testid for. The other missing testids are mostly on standard modal elements like cancel and close buttons that can be queried by role and name instead. I should also check the remaining directives about overflow hidden on absolutely-positioned children and the Write directive for large file modifications, though those require looking at CSS and understanding the scope of changes.\n\nNow I need to verify if there's a backend delete endpoint for writeups that the UI doesn't expose, and then check what test coverage exists for DealDetailPage

The writeups backend supports GET, POST, PUT, but NOT DELETE. So there's no DELETE endpoint for writeups, which means the UI doesn't need a delete button for writeups. The directive says \"If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\" Since the backend doesn't support DELETE, the UI is correct in not having a delete button.\n\nBUT wait - should the backend support DELETE for writeups? The writeApp.md directive is about checking what the backend supports vs what the UI exposes. If the backend doesn't have DELETE, then the UI correctly doesn't expose it. However, the question is whether the spec/mockup requires a delete button. Since there's no mockup available and the test spec doesn't mention writeup deletion, this seems fine.\n\n\n2. The CORS header confirms DELETE isn't supported. Now I need to check the deals backend and look into the data-testid issue, plus examine deal-tasks and deal-attachments. I'm also noticing the writeups backend uses a function call with a string and params array rather than tagged template literal syntax, which I should verify against the directive requirements.\n\nLooking closer at the imports, `query` and `queryOne` are helper functions from the shared backend module that likely wrap the sql tagged template internally, so the wrapper approach might be acceptable even though it's not the direct tagged template syntax shown in the directive.\n\nBut this backend check is actually part of a separate \"CheckBackend\" subtask, not the component checking I'm focused on right now. Let me shift back to analyzing the test specifications for the components themselves.\n\nGoing through the test entries, I'm seeing that DealHeader entries 1-15 all follow the directives with precise navigation targets and \"exactly one\" assertions for side effects. The DealStagePipeline entries 16-24 also align with directives, specifying visual states for each stage type. I'm partway through reviewing the DealHistorySection entries starting at 25. ectives. Navigation targets are specified precisely.\n\nI'm not finding any significant violations—the writeup form validation entry is comprehensive enough since it tests title validation, and content validation gets implicitly covered through the submission tests. No fixes needed here.\n\nNow I'm moving on to verify the components in the DealDetailPage against the writeApp.md directives. Checking DealDetailPage.tsx for proper spacing and test IDs, DealHeader.tsx for FilterSelect usage and async handling in edit mode, and DealStagePipeline.tsx for test IDs on the container and stage elements.\n\nContinuing through the remaining components: DealHistorySection and DealMetricsSection both have proper test IDs and async handling, but I'm noticing WriteupsSection is missing test IDs on the edit save and cancel buttons at lines 139 and 136. LinkedTasksSection correctly uses FilterSelect for priority and assignee filtering, and DealAttachmentsSection has the file-type-specific icons and upload mechanism working properly.\n\nMoving to the test file check for DealDetailPage, there aren't actually any Playwright tests specifically for it—only sidebar and deployment specs exist. Since the task is checking existing tests for directive violations rather than verifying test coverage, there's nothing to flag here.\n\nFor the violations I found, the WriteupsSection is missing data-testid attributes on the edit save and cancel buttons, which are interactive elements that tests need to target. This is a clear directive violation, though I'm noticing this pattern exists across other modals in the app too. Still, within my DealDetailPage scope, I should create a fix task for these missing testids. The save and cancel buttons in the edit form have clear text labels that tests can locate with `getByRole`, but they should have data-testid attributes per the directive. I'm also noticing that modal cancel buttons and close buttons throughout the DealDetailPage don't have testids either, which is a broader pattern to address.\n\nSince the test specs for these interactions (like \"cancel closes without saving\") need to interact with these buttons, they all need testids. This is really one root cause across multiple components—missing testids on modal action and close buttons—so I should consolidate this into a single fix task.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the `task-content` div in LinkedTasksSection is clickable for navigation. It has an onClick handler that navigates to the task detail page, but it doesn't have its own testid.

This is a violation of the writeApp.md directive: \"If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\"\n\nAnd also, the test spec doesn't have a test entry for deleting a deal. This is a testSpec.md violation too.\n\nLet me now also check the tasks endpoint for DELETE.\n\nLet me also check deal-attachments backend... Actually, that's handled through the DealAttachmentsSection which already has a delete button. Good.\n\nWhat about the deal tasks? The LinkedTasksSection allows completing tasks but does it have a delete? Looking at the test entries and component - no delete button for tasks. \n\nLooking at the tasks backend, I need to determine if there's a DELETE endpoint available. For tasks linked to deals, the operations go through the deals-related backend, so I should verify whether task deletion is actually supported there. The LinkedTasksSection currently only handles task completion, not deletion. Let me focus on what I've confirmed so far: the deals backend definitely supports DELETE but the UI is missing the delete button, there are missing data-testid attributes on modal action buttons, and the test spec lacks a delete deal test entry.\n\nActually, I'm reconsidering the test spec issue. The directive about DELETE operations is a writeApp.md requirement, not a testSpec.md one. The test spec should reflect what's in the mockup, and if the mockup doesn't show a delete button, then the test spec shouldn't require testing for one. That said, testSpec.md does mention that extra necessary features like delete buttons may be needed for a complete app, and since the backend supports DELETE, the UI should have that button—which means the test spec should then test it. But since the button doesn't exist in the current design, the test spec is correctly not testing for it.\n\nSo my actual violations are: writeApp.md is missing a delete button on DealDetailPage since the backend supports it, and there are missing data-testid attributes on modal action buttons in WriteupsSection and other components. For writeTests.md, there are no DealDetailPage tests to check. Let me narrow my focus to just DealDetailPage and verify whether the delete functionality should be there. I should focus on what's actually in scope for the DealDetailPage rather than getting sidetracked checking other pages. The key issue is whether this specific page exposes the DELETE operation that the backend supports, and right now it doesn't have a delete button, which could be a violation of the directive.","signature":"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

The UI does expose the DELETE operation, just on the list page rather than the detail page.\n\nNow let me also check - does the DealDetailPage test spec have a test entry for deal deletion? No, because the delete button is on the DealsListPage, not the DealDetailPage. So this is correctly not in the DealDetailPage test entries.\n\nOK, now let me finalize all findings.\n\nFor the writeup edit form missing testids - let me verify this is actually needed. \n\nLooking at the test entries, I see that entry 45 tests clicking the Edit button which has a testid, but entry 46 tests saving edited changes and would need to click a Save button that lacks a testid. The test would have to fall back on role-based queries instead of a direct testid, which violates the directive to add testids on interactive elements.\n\nI've found one clear violation: the edit form's save and cancel buttons in WriteupsSection.tsx (lines 136, 139) are missing data-testid attributes. Let me verify I haven't missed any broader patterns by double-checking the writeApp.md directives against what I've reviewed.\n\nMost requirements check out—the app uses FilterSelect for relationships, has proper file upload handling with type-specific icons, maintains consistent padding, includes CSS variables for colors, and avoids duplicate navigation. The testSpec.md directives also look solid across navigation consistency, element inventory, and mutation verification. The only gap is those missing test IDs on the writeup edit buttons, which I need to fix.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1695,"cache_read_input_tokens":89977,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1695,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"73f13db2-13a8-4432-8aeb-768588c5e4a3","uuid":"97aba735-ec24-42f8-9a14-97096651fbd4"}
