Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n**Changes made:**\n\n1. **`AccountsDistributionTable.tsx`** — Added responsive column hiding (`max-md:hidden`) to the nested batches table's \"Unit\" and \"Created Date\" columns (both `<th>` and `<td>` elements). Replaced inline padding style with a CSS class for responsive control.\n\n2. **`index.css`** — Added `.nested-batches-cell` class with base padding of `8px 12px 8px 48px`, which reduces to `8px 12px 8px 16px` at 640px breakpoint for better readability on narrow viewports.\n\n**Already responsive (no changes needed):**\n- Page wrapper padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n- MaterialHeader button labels (`max-sm:hidden`), page-header/actions wrapping\n- All three main tables (AccountsDistribution, AllBatches, TransactionsHistory) had column hiding\n- Filter bars already had `flex-wrap: wrap`\n- Modals already handled at 640px\n- 480px card mode for data tables\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 226517ms | Turns: 29 | Cost: $0.7973\nCost: $0.7973 (total: $64.5991)\nTurns: 29\nTask signaled <DONE>.

Filter bar needs `flex-wrap: wrap` so controls wrap on narrow viewports\n2. Nested batches table inside AccountsDistributionTable needs responsive column hiding\n3. Nested table cell left padding (48px) is too large on small screens\n\nLet me implement these fixes.\n[read] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/index.css\nGood, filter-bar already has `flex-wrap: wrap`.

Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n**Changes made:**\n\n1. **`AccountsDistributionTable.tsx`** — Added responsive column hiding (`max-md:hidden`) to the nested batches table's \"Unit\" and \"Created Date\" columns (both `<th>` and `<td>` elements). Replaced inline padding style with a CSS class for responsive control.\n\n2. **`index.css`** — Added `.nested-batches-cell` class with base padding of `8px 12px 8px 48px`, which reduces to `8px 12px 8px 16px` at 640px breakpoint for better readability on narrow viewports.\n\n**Already responsive (no changes needed):**\n- Page wrapper padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n- MaterialHeader button labels (`max-sm:hidden`), page-header/actions wrapping\n- All three main tables (AccountsDistribution, AllBatches, TransactionsHistory) had column hiding\n- Filter bars already had `flex-wrap: wrap`\n- Modals already handled at 640px\n- 480px card mode for data tables\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 226517ms | Turns: 29 | Cost: $0.7973\nCost: $0.7973 (total: $64.5991)\nTurns: 29\nTask signaled <DONE>.

Here's a summary of the responsive changes made to the TransactionDetailPage:\n\n1. **TransactionDetailPage** - Replaced inline `style={{ marginTop: 24 }}` with Tailwind `mt-6` classes for consistent spacing.\n\n2. **TransactionHeader** - Added `minWidth: 0` to prevent overflow, `wordBreak: \"break-all\"` on the transaction ID heading for long IDs, reduced metadata gap from 24px to 16px, and added `wordBreak: \"break-word\"` on the description.\n\n3. **BasicInfoSection** - Converted inline `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(180px, 1fr))` grid to explicit Tailwind responsive classes: `grid grid-cols-4 max-md:grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`.\n\n4. **QuantityTransfersTable** - Already had column hiding (`max-lg:hidden` on Source Batch ID, `max-md:hidden` on Source/Dest Amount). Added `flexWrap: \"wrap\"` to the totals row for graceful wrapping on narrow viewports.\n\n5. **BatchesCreatedTable** - Already responsive with only 3 essential columns. The global 480px card-mode CSS handles table-to-card conversion.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 239076ms | Turns: 30 | Cost: $1.1872\nCost: $1.1872 (total: $67.8112)\nTurns: 30\nTask signaled <DONE>.

Now let me also check the shared styles for common layout classes to make sure the flex/flex-col classes don't conflict:\n[grep] \\.flex\\b|\\.flex-col|\\.hidden\\b\nGood, no conflicts. Now let me also check if there are any other inline styles in the page or components that need responsive improvements. Let me look at the amount input with fixed width:\n[read] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/components/QuantityTransfersSection.tsx\nThe amount input width of 100px is reasonable for a numeric field even on mobile. The grid will collapse to single column at `max-sm:`, and the 100px input with the unit dropdown beside it will fit fine.\n\nNow let me run the type check to make sure everything compiles:\n$ cd /repo/apps/InventoryTracker && npm run check 2>&1 | tail -30\n> inventory-tracker@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\n\n--- Typecheck ---\n\n--- Lint ---\n\nAll checks passed.\nAll checks pass. Now let me update the plan.md and mark this task complete.\n[edit] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/docs/plan.md\nSince all pages are now done, mark the section heading with `✓`:\n[edit] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/docs/plan.md\n[TodoWrite]\nLet me verify the final state of the plan:\n[read] /repo/apps/InventoryTracker/docs/plan.md\nAll pages are checked off and the section is marked complete. Here's a summary of the changes made:\n\n**NewTransactionPage.tsx**: Converted inline `style={{ display: \"flex\", flexDirection: \"column\", gap: 24 }}` to Tailwind-style utility classes `flex flex-col gap-6`.\n\n**QuantityTransfersSection.tsx**: Made the \"Add Quantity Transfer\" button text responsive — full text shown on desktop, shortened to \"Add\" at `max-sm:` (640px).\n\n**BatchAllocationSection.tsx**: Made the \"Create New Batch\" button text responsive — full text shown on desktop, shortened to \"Add\" at `max-sm:` (640px).\n\n**index.css**: Added utility classes (`hidden`, `flex`, `flex-col`, `inline`) and the `max-sm:inline` responsive variant to support the button text toggling.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 252664ms | Turns: 40 | Cost: $1.3843\nCost: $1.3843 (total: $69.1955)\nTurns: 40\nTask signaled <DONE>.
