You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me analyze what I see:\n\n**Dialog Title:** \"Create New Report\" with subtitle \"Configure parameters to generate a financial report based on accounts and transactions.\"\n**X close button** in top right corner.\n\n**Left Panel - Report Settings:**\n\n1. **Report Type** - Three tab/button options:\n   - \"Summary Overview\" (with an icon)\n   - \"Detailed Transactions\" (with an icon)\n   - \"Budget vs. Actual (Comparison)\" (with an icon, currently selected/highlighted in blue)\n\n2. **Date Range** section:\n   - Start and end date pickers defaulting to October 1-31, 2023, plus quick-select buttons for \"This Month\", \"Last Quarter\", and \"YTD\"\n\n3. **Filter Accounts & Categories** section:\n   - A collapsible tree structure with checkboxes for Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, and Expenses categories, all currently selected\n   - The Expenses category is expanded to show subcategories like Operating Expenses and Cost of Goods Sold (both checked) and Non-Operating Expenses (unchecked)\n   - A toggle for including zero balance accounts, which is currently disabled\n\n**Right Panel - Report Preview:**\nThe preview displays a \"Budget vs. Actual - Oct 2023\" report with a refresh button, showing a table comparing budgeted versus actual figures across revenue, expenses, and net income with variance calculations and percentages.\n\nNow I'm working through the test structure systematically. For the main dialog component, I need to replace the placeholder with actual test cases covering the dialog-level functionality, then add specific test entries for each of the four subcomponents: the report type selector, date range picker, account category filter, and the preview panel. all the tests now. I'll organize by component as seen in the existing patterns.\n\nLet me write the complete section for the CreateReportDialog page.\n\n**Dialog-level tests:**\n- Dialog displays title \"Create New Report\" and subtitle\n- X button closes dialog\n- Cancel button closes dialog\n- Generate Report button generates the report\n- Generate Report button is disabled when required fields are missing\n- Dialog has two-panel layout (settings on left, preview on right)\n\n**ReportTypeSelector:**\n- Three report type tabs displayed: Summary Overview, Detailed Transactions, Budget vs. Actual (Comparison)\n- Each tab has an icon\n- Budget vs. Actual is selectable and highlights when selected\n- Summary Overview is selectable\n- Detailed Transactions is selectable\n- Default selection state\n- Selecting report type updates the preview panel\n\n**DateRangeSelector:**\n- Displays \"Date Range\" heading\n- Start and End Date pickers with calendar icons that allow selecting dates\n- Three preset buttons (\"This Month\", \"Last Quarter\", \"YTD\") that set the date range to the current month, last quarter, or January 1 to today respectively\n\n**AccountCategoryFilter:**\n- Displays \"Filter Accounts & Categories\" heading with a tree structure showing five top-level categories (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Expenses), each with a checkbox and \"(All)\" label, all checked by default\n- Categories expand to reveal sub-categories like Operating Expenses, Cost of Goods Sold, and Non-Operating Expenses, each with individual checkboxes\n- Unchecking a category or sub-category updates the filter\n\n, with parent categories unchecking all children when toggled off\n- \"Include Zero Balance Accounts\" toggle switch is available and off by default\n\n**ReportPreview:**\n- Displays a dynamic title based on selections, a refresh button, and a table with columns for Category/Account, Budget, Actual, Variance, and Variance %, including summary rows for Total Revenue, Total Expenses, and Net Income\n- Account rows like Sales Revenue and Rent Expense are expandable to show sub-accounts\n- Cancel and Generate Report buttons appear at
