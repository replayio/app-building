Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"faac78c4-d729-46c6-8bec-16115e64484d","uuid":"331a747e-9327-4c74-8c42-da039b884d94","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Looking at the subsequent tasks, I see tasks for ProductionHub, then SalesCRM, then SupplierTracker, then Accounting-related tasks (with AccountHeader, BudgetOverview, etc.), and then InventoryTracker-related tasks (with accounts, materials, batches, transactions).\n\nI need to figure out which app the SetupApp task is for. The task queue shows the task at the top doesn't specify an app name. Let me check which apps already have code and which don't. The fact that the next tasks are about ProductionHub writeScript, and then SalesCRM testSpec/writeShared/writeApp...\n\n\nActually, looking at the full queue structure, I can see SetupApp is its own initial task, followed by ProductionHub tasks, then SalesCRM, SupplierTracker, Accounting, and InventoryTracker tasks in sequence. This suggests SetupApp might be a foundational setup before the named apps, or it could be for one of these apps. Let me check which apps already have code implemented.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8051,"cache_read_input_tokens":28494,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8051,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"faac78c4-d729-46c6-8bec-16115e64484d","uuid":"acb6a0d6-1c6d-40bb-af9f-353c25e7de66"}

The SetupApp task is first in the queue, so I need to figure out which app it's actually for.

Since ProductionHub already has code and structure in place, I should check the git log to understand what was recently done and whether this SetupApp task is actually meant for ProductionHub or a different app.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":917,"cache_read_input_tokens":36545,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":917,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"faac78c4-d729-46c6-8bec-16115e64484d","uuid":"fb9582c0-a007-4854-90f9-69d9dcae63d8"}
