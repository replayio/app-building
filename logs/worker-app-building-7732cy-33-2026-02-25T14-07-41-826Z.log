Let me update the todo list to mark everything as completed.\n[TodoWrite]\nAll 7 subtasks are complete. Here's a summary of what was built:\n\n**Backend:**\n- `netlify/functions/runs.ts` — Full CRUD API for production runs with GET (single/list), POST, PUT, DELETE. The GET single endpoint returns the run joined with recipe name/product, recipe materials, run forecasts, and run equipment.\n\n**Redux:**\n- `src/slices/runsSlice.ts` — Redux slice with `fetchRuns`, `fetchRunById`, `updateRun` thunks and `clearCurrentRun` action\n- `src/store.ts` — Updated to include the `runs` reducer\n\n**Types:**\n- `src/types/index.ts` — Added `RunForecast`, `RunEquipmentItem`, and `RunDetail` interfaces\n\n**Components:**\n1. **RunHeader** — Breadcrumb (Home > Runs > ID), page title, and High-Level Information card showing Run ID, Date/Time, Product, Associated Recipe, Planned Quantity, and Status badge (blue/green/red per status)\n2. **RunActions** — Adjust Quantities, Confirm Run, Cancel Run buttons with visibility logic based on status (hidden for Cancelled, only Cancel visible for Confirmed). Includes quantity edit modal and cancel confirmation dialog.\n3. **RawMaterialsTable** — Recipe and Raw Materials section with Material, Amount Needed (calculated: per-batch × planned quantity), Units columns\n4. **ForecastTable** — Forecast/Availability section with Material, Required Amount, Forecast Available, Shortage/Excess (green/red indicators), Pending Deliveries columns\n5. **RunEquipmentTable** — Equipment and Availability section with Equipment, Status, Notes columns\n6. **ExternalAppLinks** — \"View in Inventory App\" and \"View in Delivery App\" links separated by a divider, opening in new tabs\n\n**Page:**\n- `src/pages/RunDetailsPage.tsx` — Assembles all components with the layout: header+actions side-by-side at top, then materials, forecasts, equipment, and external links below\n\n**Styling:**\n- Added CSS for run details layout, run status badges, forecast surplus/shortage indicators, run actions, and external links\n\nAll typecheck passes cleanly.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 283335ms | Turns: 49 | Cost: $2.1915\nCost: $2.1915 (total: $72.6062)\nTurns: 49\nTask signaled <DONE>.

The issue is actually that `useState` is not typed properly for the callback and the `recipes` from useAppSelector nee... (truncated)\n\nThe real issue is that the recipes state is using generic types. Let me fix the type annotations properly.\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx\nWait, the issue might be something else. Let me check the RootState type more carefully.\n[read] /repo/apps/shared/store/store.ts\nThe `Record<string, Reducer>` in the shared store loses specific types. I need explicit type annotations. Let me fix all the type errors.\n[read] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx\nNow fix the `useState` callback to `useEffect` for loading recipes:\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx\nNow fix the recipe dropdown map:\n[read] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarHeader.tsx\nNow fix the RunDetailsPopup implicit any types:\n[read] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/RunDetailsPopup.tsx\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/RunDetailsPopup.tsx\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/RunDetailsPopup.tsx\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/RunDetailsPopup.tsx\nNow fix CalendarGrid unused variable and CalendarPage:\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/CalendarGrid.tsx\nNow fix CalendarPage:\n[read] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/pages/CalendarPage.tsx\n[edit] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/pages/CalendarPage.tsx\nNow run the check again.\n$ npm run check 2>&1 | head -40\n> production-hub@1.0.0 check\n> tsx scripts/check.ts\n\nRunning typecheck...\nTypecheck passed.\nNo eslint config found, skipping lint.\nAll checks passed.\nAll checks pass.
