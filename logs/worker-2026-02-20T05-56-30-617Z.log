Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly.

Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"cf328632-a7dd-4877-b149-4180e2956ad9","uuid":"10f76e28-1143-4ba5-b865-de66df0c724e","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

[2026-02-20T05:52:30.449Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Dnk7gXyftGHE5uwTU7v9eh","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup. Let me compare it against the test entries systematically.\n\nLooking at the mockup:\n1. **Sidebar**: Dashboard, Clients (highlighted), Deals, Tasks, Reports, Settings (at top), Settings (at bottom)\n2. **Header**: \"Clients\" title, Import button, Export button, \"+ Add New Client\" button\n3. **Search bar**: \"Search clients by name, tag, or contact...\"\n4. **Filters**: Status: All, Tags: All, Source: All, Sort: Recently Updated\n5. **Table columns**: Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, Open Deals, Next Task, action button (\"...\")\n\n\n6. **Rows**: Acme Corp, Globex Solutions, Jane Doe, Stark Industries, Wayne Enterprises, Liam Smith\n7. **Pagination**: \"Showing 1-50 of 324 clients\", Previous, 1, 2, 3, ..., Next\n\nNow I'm checking this against the testSpec.md directives. The sidebar shows Dashboard, Clients, Deals, Tasks, Reports, and Settings, but the test entries reference \"Clients, Deals, Tasks, Team, Settings\" in CLP-NAV-01. There's a discrepancy here—the mockup has Dashboard and Reports instead of Team, which I need to flag. Tasks, Reports, Settings are the navigation items, with the test specifying routes for Deals, Tasks, Team (/users), Settings, and Clients—the mockup shows Reports instead of Team, but since we're maintaining consistency across the implementation, that's acceptable. The table columns match perfectly between the mockup and test requirements: Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, Open Deals, and Next Task.\n\nNow I'm verifying that every clickable element has its navigation target or action result specified—the sidebar items route correctly, clicking a client name goes to the detail page, row actions handle viewing and deleting clients with proper confirmation, and the header buttons open the create modal, import dialog, and export function as expected. I should also confirm that data mutations like creating a new client persist correctly and show up in the list immediately.\n\nLooking at the timeline question—the ClientDetailPage does have a timeline component, but based on the existing CDP-TL docs, it tracks task creation, notes, deal changes, and similar events rather than the initial client creation itself, so that's probably not needed here. For the button styling, the Import and Export buttons have their respective icons and the Add New Client button is properly styled as a primary action, which all checks out.\n\nNow examining the modal dialog coverage—I've got tests for the create client modal, import dialog, import contacts dialog, and delete confirmation, but I'm noticing a gap: CLP-ACT-02 lists \"Edit\" as a row action option, yet there's no test verifying what happens when you click it. That's potentially a missing test case.\n\nFor the import/upload directive, both CLP-HDR-04 and CLP-HDR-07 properly specify their data formats, so that's covered. On the state-changing actions front, I'm checking whether CLP-HDR-03 adequately tests the persistence of a newly created client—it mentions persistence but doesn't explicitly verify that navigating to the client detail page reflects the change, though CLP-ACT-04's deletion is already covered by the cross-cutting DATA-04 test.\n\nLooking at the actual violations in testSpec.md, the Edit row action stands out as a gap—CLP-ACT-02 acknowledges Edit exists but there's no corresponding test entry specifying what happens when you click it, which breaks the rule that every clickable element needs a documented action result. The Dashboard sidebar item is missing from the test entries, though that might be acceptable if the app doesn't implement it. And the Wayne Enterprises entry CLP-TBL-08 appears to have incomplete data about what the Deals and Next Task fields should display.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking each element in the mockup against the test entries to identify what's actually being tested and what's not. The navigation items are mostly covered, but there are a few sidebar links like Reports that don't appear in the test specs at all, similar to the Dashboard situation.\n\nMoving through the header and filtering section, I can see the Import, Export, and Add New Client buttons are all accounted for, along with the search functionality and various filter options including status, tags, source, and sort capabilities. The table columns are starting to be referenced but the list appears to cut off.\n\nNow looking at the table itself, the row data and action buttons are covered, though I'm noticing there's a gap—the Edit action test is missing from the action menu options. I'm also spotting a discrepancy between what the mockup shows and what the test entries reference: the mockup only displays Import and Export buttons, but the test entries mention Import Contacts with separate test IDs, which doesn't align with what's actually visible in the design. There's a discrepancy in the test spec itself—CLP-HDR-01 lists three buttons but the component description includes four, yet CLP-HDR-07 does test the Import Contacts button, so it's being validated elsewhere. This seems like a minor documentation inconsistency rather than an actual problem with the implementation.\n\nLooking at the violations I've identified so far, the more significant issue is that CLP-ACT-02 mentions \"Edit\" as an available action but there's no dedicated test verifying what happens when you click it—whether it opens a dialog, what fields appear, or if changes actually persist.\n\nFor the header buttons, CLP-HDR-01 lists three buttons while the component spec shows four, with Import Contacts being tested separately in CLP-HDR-07 but not inventoried in the main

The main page and header components are set up with testids for the page container, header section, and all action buttons like import, export, and add client.\n\nThe search bar, filter controls, and table all have testids on their containers and individual interactive elements—search input, filter dropdowns, table rows with client data, and action menus. I'm checking the pagination component to ensure it has testids on its controls as well. Finishing up the test IDs for ImportDialog and FilterSelect, then checking the Sidebar component. Everything looks solid so far. Now I'm verifying that all filter controls use the custom FilterSelect component instead of native HTML selects—both ClientsFilterControls and AddClientModal are following this pattern correctly.\n\nMoving on to the database layer, I'm confirming that all queries in clients.ts use the tagged template literal syntax with the neon driver, which they do. Finally, I'm checking the handling of empty strings for date and UUID columns—the code properly converts them to null using the `||` operator rather than nullish coalescing, which ensures empty strings don't slip through. I'm verifying that `date_acquired` correctly uses `||` for null conversion since it's a DATE column. Now checking the path parsing logic for Netlify Functions — the resource ID should be at index 3 after splitting and filtering, which checks out for the `/clients/123` pattern. Moving on to validate the navigation sidebar requirements.\n\nThe sidebar has five distinct routes with no duplicates, so that's good. The AddClientModal doesn't need a searchable dropdown since it's not referencing other entities. Attachment-related directives don't apply here since this page only handles file imports. Now I need to check the monorepo configuration for Netlify.\n\nLooking at the visual elements against the mockup, the filter components match up correctly—the sort dropdown shows \"Recently Updated,\" and the status, tags, and source filters all display their default \"All\" states as expected. The sort options include recently updated, alphabetical ascending, and alphabetical descending.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing a discrepancy with test spec CLP-FLT-07, which requires the dropdown to include \"Most Deals\" as an option. Checking the ClientsFilterControls component, the sort options array appears to be incomplete—it's missing the \"Most Deals\" option that the spec calls for.\n\nLooking at the backend sortMap in clients.ts, there's no corresponding \"most_deals\" entry either, so this is a gap in both the frontend and backend implementation that violates the requirement to ensure test spec entries are satisfied by the app code.\n\nI should also verify the onEdit handler in ClientsTable to check if there are other potential issues... the Edit button exists in the UI but just duplicates the View functionality, which is misleading but doesn't technically violate the writeApp directive since there's no test spec requirement defining what Edit should do. The main violation I've identified is the missing \"Most Deals\" sort option in the ClientsListPage—the test spec explicitly requires it, but it's absent from both the filter controls and the backend

Also assert the side effect happens exactly once.\"**\n\n- CLP-HDR-03: Creates a client and checks it appears in the table, but the test doesn't actually reload the page to verify persistence even though the spec mentions that requirement.\n\nCLP-ACT-04 does include the reload check, so there's an inconsistency. The directive about side effects is relevant here—creating a client has persistence as a side effect, and the test should verify both that the client shows up in the table and that it persists across a page reload. CLP-HDR-03 only checks the primary effect.\n\nNow I'm looking at the getByText() usage more carefully against the directive about avoiding common words. The sidebar's \"Clients\" text could match other elements on the page, and there's a more specific test ID available that I should be using instead. Checking the Settings locator in the sidebar—the component only has the nav link, no duplicate text, so that should resolve correctly. Moving through the modal locators now, verifying that each one like \"Client Name *\", \"Tags (comma-separated)\", and \"Acquisition Source\" are properly scoped and specific to the modal context.\n\nFor the page-level queries, \"Test Corp\" with exact matching and \"Import Test Corp\" are both distinctive enough to avoid conflicts. The table header queries are also safe since they're scoped to just the header section where duplicates shouldn't exist.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test file's data-testid values actually match what's defined in the components—so far the sidebar and sidebar-nav-clients identifiers are checking out.\n\nVerifying the rest of the testids across the components... Continuing through the table components—I've verified the clients table structure with its headers and row elements, plus the status badges and row action menu with view, edit, and delete options. Now I need to confirm the confirm dialog component exists and has the right test IDs.\n\nLooking at the file upload directives, both test cases are properly using `setInputFiles` with buffers. I'm also checking that no Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics are nested inside `.toPass()` retry blocks.\n\nFor the sort test, `allTextContents()` returns immediately without waiting, so that's safe. Now checking the combined filters test...\n\n`count()` actually doesn't auto-wait either — it just returns the current count from the DOM. The directive is specifically about calls like `click()`, `fill()`, and `textContent()` that do wait for elements to be attached, so this test should be fine too. The better approach would be using `toHaveCount(0)` with the negation instead, which properly handles the waiting semantics. Looking at lines 489-493, there's the same `count()` issue inside `toPass()`, and checking if count is greater than or equal to 0 doesn't really make sense since count is always non-negative.\n\nLines 702-709 have multiple `count()` calls within `toPass()` that violate the directive's guidance, and while `count()` doesn't technically auto-wait, the pattern still needs refactoring.\n\nLooking back at the directive more carefully, it explicitly lists `count()` as an auto-wait semantic call that shouldn't be used inside `.toPass()` retry blocks when dealing with dynamic elements. Even though `count()` doesn't technically auto-wait in Playwright, the rule is clear and I need to follow it. Let me review the other `.toPass()` blocks to identify all violations. I'm seeing that some test cases already follow the preferred pattern with `toHaveCount()` assertions, like the ones at lines 298-303 and 401-406, which use atomic Playwright assertions with proper timeout configurations.\n\nLooking at the directive about not relying on fixed database record counts, most tests seem compliant—CLP-PGN-01 uses relative comparisons, CLP-ACT-04 captures initial state and compares relatively, and CLP-TBL-02 avoids count checks entirely. However, CLP-TBL-08 at line 708 is asserting that all visible rows match a specific condition, which is valid since it's checking a property rather than hardcoding an absolute count.\n\nNow I'm spotting some weak assertions in the search tests. CLP-SRCH-03 and CLP-SRCH-04 both check if the table is visible and then verify row counts, but the assertions like `expect(rowCount).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)` are always true and don't actually confirm the results are filtered by the intended criteria—they're missing verification of the primary filtering effect.\n\nI'm also seeing this same pattern in the filter tests. CLP-FLT-04 has the same weak assertion issue, and CLP-FLT-06 compounds the problem by combining `.toPass()` with a count check that's always true. CLP-FLT-07 is checking that certain filter option texts exist in the list, which is a stronger assertion approach. The helper function opens a dropdown menu, waits for it to be visible, collects all the button text contents, closes the menu, and returns the texts—using `allTextContents()` which doesn't require auto-waiting.

The test uses `confirm-dialog` (line 785) and `confirm-ok` (line 789). These match. ✓\n\nNow let me summarize the writeTests.md violations I found:\n\n1. **`.toPass()` blocks with `count()` calls**: \n   - Lines 538-542 (CLP-FLT-09): `count()` inside `.toPass()`  \n   - Lines 489-493 (CLP-FLT-06): `count()` inside `.toPass()`\n   - Lines 702-709 (CLP-TBL-08): multiple `count()` calls inside `.toPass()`\n\nThese all violate the directive against putting Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics inside a `.toPass()` retry block.\n\n2. **Weak/no-op assertions**: \n   - CLP-SRCH-03 (line 324): `expect(rowCount).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)` is always true\n   - CLP-SRCH-04 (line 341): `expect(rowCount).toBeGreaterThan(0)` needs verification\n   - CLP-FLT-04 (line 446): `expect(count).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)` is always true\n   - CLP-FLT-06 (line 492): `expect(count).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)` inside `.toPass()` is always true\n\nThese assertions don't meaningfully verify the expected behavior—they're essentially checking nothing. The tests should be verifying both the primary effect and any side effects with actual precision.\n\n3. **CLP-FLT-07 missing \"Most Deals\" check**: The test spec indicates this sort option should exist, but the test never validates it. This points to a component implementation gap rather than a test problem.\n\nLooking at the violations more broadly, I'm seeing that the `.toPass()` blocks using `count()` calls and the weak `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)` assertions are somewhat interconnected—fixing one approach could address both issues by using more atomic, meaningful assertions instead.\n\nI'm also noticing CLP-TBL-03 iterates through badges using `count()` and `nth()` to validate each one, which might have similar concerns. I'm checking CLP-TBL-08 which also uses count and nth iteration outside a `.toPass()` block, so it's technically compliant with the directive even though it has the same potential DOM-change vulnerability.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the `getByText()` usage throughout the file. The sidebar navigation items like `getByText('Clients')` are scoped to the sidebar container, so they're acceptable even though they're common words. The modal and table header uses of `getByText()` are more specific—things like \"Client Name *\" and \"Client Name\" in their respective contexts—so those look fine too.\n\nFor the page-level queries, `getByText('Test Corp', { exact: true })` uses exact matching which is good, and `getByText('Import Test Corp')` is unique enough that substring matching won't cause issues.\n\nThe main violation I'm finding is the `.toPass()` blocks that use `count()`, which directly contradicts the directive against auto-retrying with count
