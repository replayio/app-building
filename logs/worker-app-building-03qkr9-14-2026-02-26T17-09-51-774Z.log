If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result\n4. For data-mutating actions, verify persistence and side effects\n5. Button/control appearance matters - test entry should verify appearance\n6. Completely test modal dialogs\n7. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n8. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n9. Backend integrations must include setup instructions\n10. State-changing actions must test that other parts update (timeline, relationships)\n11.

Clicking the breadcrumb navigates back to the AccountsPage.`\n\nSo the breadcrumb test spec and code are consistent with each other. However, the breadcrumb text \"Page / AccountDetailPage\" is quite unusual. Most apps would say \"Accounts / Main Checking\" or similar. But this is not a directive violation per se - the test spec describes what's there and the code matches.\n\n\nI need to refocus on what I'm actually checking: whether the test entries in tests.md follow the testSpec.md directives about how tests should be written, not whether the code itself is well-designed. The spec entry matches the implementation, so there's no violation here.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the actual directives to see what aspects of the AccountDetailPage should be tested - things like whether all visible elements are covered, if clickable elements specify their exact navigation targets, whether data mutations are tested for persistence, and if state changes propagate to other parts of the interface.\n\nLooking at the breadcrumb implementation, the test shows it displays \"Page / AccountDetailPage\" but the code just uses generic labels like \"Page\" instead of something more descriptive like \"Accounts\" - I should check if this breadcrumb labeling is consistent with how other pages handle it, since \"Page\" seems too vague for a navigation breadcrumb.\n\nActually, this isn't a testSpec directive violation - the breadcrumb text is a design choice, not a formatting rule issue. Let me focus on whether there are actual directive violations by checking if every visible element is systematically inventoried: AccountHeader covers the account name, category, breadcrumb, and buttons; BudgetOverview has the heading, amounts, percentage, and progress bar; TransactionsTab includes tabs, table headers, rows, links, and empty states; BudgetDetailsTab shows budget items and progress indicators.\n\nFor clickable elements, I'm verifying that each one specifies its navigation target or action result - the breadcrumb goes back to AccountsPage, the New Transaction button opens a modal, View/Edit links open the modal pre-populated, tabs switch views, and report links navigate to their respective dialogs. Now I need to check whether data-mutating actions specify persistence and verification. side effects**\n   - \"BudgetDetailsTab item amounts reflect transaction data\": Tests that after recording a new transaction, the budget line item and Budget Overview update. ✓\n\n4. **Directive: Completely test modal dialogs**\n   - NewTransactionModal is opened from AccountHeader. Tests exist for opening it and seeing pre-populated data. But the full modal testing would be in the NewTransactionModal section, not here.\n\n5. **Directive: Button/control appearance matters**\n   - New Transaction button: \"filled/prominent style\" ✓\n   - Tab active state: \"underline or highlighted style\" ✓\n\nOverall, the test entries for the AccountDetailPage look thorough. I don't see any obvious directive violations.\n\nWait - actually let me re-check directive #3: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\"\n\nI'm noticing the ReportingLinks test entries use \"or\" language that creates ambiguity about what actually happens. Lines 314 and 324 both say the app either navigates to CreateReportDialog or generates a report pre-configured with specific data, but that's unclear about which action actually occurs. The directive requires specifying the exact result, not leaving it open-ended.

[2026-02-26T17:05:22.562Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01XBoN6MdT6widBqjgeFMKyQ","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I see the code for ReportingLinks. The links actually open a CreateReportDialog (a modal) rather than navigating. Let me check the test entries:\n\nLine 313-314: **ReportingLinks Actual vs Budget Report link navigates to report**\n- \"The app navigates to the CreateReportDialog or generates a report pre-configured to show the Actual vs Budget comparison for the 'Main Checking' account.\"\n\nLine 321-324: **ReportingLinks Transaction History Report link navigates to report**\n- \"The app navigates to the CreateReportDialog or generates a report pre-configured to show the Transaction History for the 'Main Checking' account.\"\n  \nThe test entries use \"or\" which is ambiguous—they should be specific about what actually happens. The code opens a CreateReportDialog modal with the report type and account pre-selected, so the entries should say exactly that instead of leaving it unclear whether it navigates or generates. Let me look at what the tests.md file says around lines 605-614 to see if there's more context. I'm being too strict here—looking back at line 314, the test entry actually does specify the exact behavior: it says the report type is set to 'Budget vs Actual' and the account is pre-selected, so the expected outcome is clear enough. The \"or\" phrasing is just describing the same action in two ways rather than presenting alternatives.\n\nBut there's still a terminology issue: the test says \"navigates to the CreateReportDialog\" when it should say \"opens\" since a modal appears on the same page rather than navigating away. That's a violation of the exact navigation target directive. The more detailed tests in the CreateReportDialog section (lines 605-614) probably cover this same scenario with better precision.\n\nLooking at other potential issues, the breadcrumb test mentions a generic \"Page\" label that's not very descriptive, though the directive doesn't strictly require specific naming conventions. The search bar correctly tests as transaction-only filtering. I should also verify that all listed components have corresponding test entries—AccountHeader, BudgetOverview, and TransactionsTab are covered, but I need to check if Budget is fully addressed.\n\nNow examining the actual violations, the ReportingLinks tests are problematic. Lines 311-314 describe the behavior as \"navigates to report\" when it actually opens a modal dialog—this violates the directive against ambiguous navigation destinations. The language is misleading about what actually happens. The phrasing \"navigates to the CreateReportDialog or generates a report\" is imprecise—the actual behavior is opening a modal, which is a specific action that should be stated clearly. I'm noticing there are more detailed test entries further down that accurately describe the modal opening with pre-selected fields, so these ReportingLinks entries are somewhat redundant and less precise than what's already documented.\n\nI should flag this as a mild violation rather than overanalyzing it. Now I'm checking whether the test coverage aligns with the directives—specifically whether every visible element is inventoried and whether data mutations are properly verified, like confirming that new transactions created through the modal actually persist in the account detail view. So the NewTransactionModal tests do cover the transaction appearing on the AccountDetailPage with the correct details across both accounts. That's good—no gap there.\n\nNow let me check the design directive about consistent styling and navigation. That's more of a visual guideline than something that would show up as a test violation.\n\nI think I've found the main issues with the test spec. The ReportingLinks tests are unclear about what happens after navigating to the report, and there might be some ambiguity around whether certain side effects are properly tested.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully, the \"or\" phrasing in those test entries does violate the directive about specifying exact navigation targets. But the CreateReportDialog tests already cover the modal behavior pretty thoroughly, so this is more of a wording clarification issue than a missing test.\n\nLet me step back and think about whether this is actually a significant violation or just a minor inconsistency that's already been addressed elsewhere in the spec.\n\nI should check the mockup image to see if there are any untested UI

Let me inventory the visible elements:\n\n1. **NavBar** at top: \"FINTREK\" logo/brand, Search bar, grid icon, user avatar - these are NavBar elements, tested elsewhere\n2. **Breadcrumb**: \"Page / AccountDetailPage\" - tested ✓\n3. **Account name**: \"Account: Main Checking\" - tested ✓\n4. **Category label**: \"Category: Asset\" - tested ✓\n5. **New Transaction button** in upper right - tested ✓\n6. **Budget Overview section**:\n   - \"Budget Overview\" heading - tested ✓\n   - Progress bar showing 90% usage with actual spend of $4,500 against a $5,000 budget - tested ✓\n7. **Tabs**: \"Transactions\" and \"Budget Details\" - tested ✓\n8. **Transactions tab** (shown as active):\n   - Column headers: Date, Description, Amount, Direction, Actions - tested ✓\n   - Transaction rows with data - tested ✓\n   - View/Edit links in Actions column - tested ✓\n9. **Budget Details tab** also visible in the layout with individual category breakdowns:\n   - Rent, Utilities, and Groceries categories each with their own progress bars showing actual versus budgeted amounts - tested ✓\n   - Groceries appears to be over-budget - tested ✓\n10. **Reporting section**:\n    - \"Reporting\" heading - tested ✓\n    - \"Actual vs Budget Report\" and \"Transaction History Report\" links - tested ✓\n\nI'm noticing the mockup shows Utilities listed twice, which seems like it might be a duplicate in the test data rather than intentional design.\n\nLooking at the search functionality, the mockup places the search bar in the top navigation area, and the test confirms users search from there. The AccountHeader in the code has a search input, but based on the mockup layout, the primary search should be in the NavBar at the top.\n\nI'm also noticing a discrepancy between the mockup and code structure: the mockup displays Transactions and Budget Details side by side, while the code implements them as tabs that switch between views. This is a significant difference from what the mockup shows. them as tabs.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the mockup, it looks like these could be two columns within the same view, with Transactions on the left and Budget Details on the right. The tab-like styling might just be headers for each column. But the test entries describe them as switchable tabs.\n\nHmm, this is interesting. Let me look at the mockup again. The \"Transactions\" and \"Budget Details\" labels at the top of the section look like tab headers. The \"Transactions\" tab appears underlined/active. But then the Budget Details content is also shown to the right.\n\nIn the code, these are exclusive tabs - you see one or the other. But in the mockup, it looks like they might be side by side. This could be a testSpec directive violation:\n- **Directive: \"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\"**\n\nThe mockup appears to show a two-column layout with both sections visible simultaneously, while the test entries describe exclusive tabs that switch between states. Mockups often display multiple states for clarity, but the positioning here suggests these are meant to be parallel columns rather than switchable views. This represents a meaningful departure from what's shown visually, and implementing tabs instead would be substituting a simpler pattern for the actual design intent. Looking at the mockup more carefully, I see the ambiguity—it could show either a two-column layout or tabs with both states illustrated. Since the code implements tabs and the AppSpec doesn't mandate a specific layout mechanism, this isn't a clear violation.

Let me check against the writeApp.md directives:\n\n**writeApp.md Directives:**\n1. Always run `npm run check` from the app directory\n2. When working on a component, identify test entries and make sure requirements are satisfied\n3. Match visual appearance to mockup\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items\n5. In a monorepo, add `base = \"apps/...\"` to `netlify.toml`\n6. When using neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax\n7. For DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns, convert empty strings to null using `value || null`\n\n\n8. Netlify Functions path index for resourceId is 3, not 2\n9. Use searchable select/dropdown for modals referencing other entities\n10. Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links\n11. Never use native HTML `<select>` for filter controls\n12. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons\n13. Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads\n14. Every page component must include consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n\nNow I'm going through each component to verify compliance. Starting with AccountDetailPage.tsx, I need to check that the padding directive is properly applied throughout the page layout.\n\nChecking AccountDetailPage.tsx for the required data-testid attributes on the page container, tab buttons, and tab content areas.\n\nMoving to AccountHeader.tsx to verify the data-testid attributes are present on the header container and account name elements.\n\nNow I need to check whether the breadcrumb component has the proper testid since it's an interactive clickable element, and then verify BudgetOverview.tsx has its testid in place.\n\nMoving on to TransactionsTab.tsx, I'm checking that the empty state, table, and individual transaction rows all have their testids properly assigned. Continuing through BudgetDetailsTab, I've verified the amounts and progress bar test IDs are in place. Now moving to ReportingLinks where I'm checking the container, title, and interactive button elements for proper test identifiers. Let me look at the Breadcrumb component

But the breadcrumb items (the clickable links) don't have individual testids. However, the breadcrumb is interactive (the first item is clickable, navigating to `/accounts`). \n\nThe breadcrumb separator uses `>` but the mockup and test spec says `/`. Looking at the mockup, the breadcrumb shows \"Page / AccountDetailPage\" with a `/` separator. But the code uses `>` as the separator. This is a visual mismatch between mockup and code.\n\n\nI'm noticing the Breadcrumb is a shared component, so changing the separator would affect all apps using it. I need to check whether the mockup and test spec specifically require the `/` separator for this implementation. The breadcrumb separator mismatch (`/` in mockup vs `>` in code) is a real discrepancy, but since it's in a shared component affecting all apps, I'll note it without creating a fix task. Now I'm checking the other writeApp.md directives, starting with the one about avoiding native HTML select elements for filters and dropdowns.\n\nLooking through the AccountDetailPage components, I don't see any select elements being used. The padding directive is properly applied with `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the main page container and all loading/error states. The child components like BudgetOverview and TransactionsTab are correctly layout-agnostic without outer padding. The netlify.toml file has the correct base path set for the Accounting app. Now I'm checking the navigation requirements.\n\nThe sidebar directive about duplicate links doesn't apply here since these components don't have a sidebar. Looking at the JSX abstraction guideline, the tab buttons in AccountDetailPage are inline (lines 110-125) rather than in a separate component. While the guideline states all JSX should be abstracted into separate components, these tab buttons are simple state-control elements that are integral to the page's layout logic, so keeping them inline is reasonable.\n\nNow I need to clarify whether I should be checking guidelines or directives. The task specifically mentions checking directive violations, and writeApp.md separates these into two sections. The \"all JSX abstraction\" rule is listed under Guidelines, not Directives, so I should focus on the Directives section instead. Let me go through those directives systematically to see which ones are actually verifiable from the code. I need to verify that the backend functions used by this page's Redux slices follow the tagged template literal syntax for queries, handle empty strings as null for date/timestamp/UUID columns, and use the correct Netlify Functions path structure.","signature":"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

This means the index concern doesn't apply here.\n\n**Directive: Use searchable select/dropdown for modals referencing other entities**\n\nI need to check the NewTransactionModal to see if it implements a searchable select for account selection.\n\n**Directive: Never use native HTML `<select>` for filter controls**\n\nI've reviewed all the components and none of them use the native `<select>` element. Let me verify the NewTransactionModal as well since it's referenced from this page.\n\nThe backend functions look solid overall—all queries use parameterized template literals, dates are properly handled with null fallbacks, and path parsing is implemented correctly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7376,"cache_read_input_tokens":68348,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7376,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"63ff9be5-3f28-4889-9054-4ba11a35a624","uuid":"0db682f4-1b88-4d61-9593-b3073f4785f1"}

Let me go through each directive:\n\n**writeTests.md Directives:**\n\n1. **Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists.**\n   - Line 34: `await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/accounts$/)` ✓ - breadcrumb test checks URL.\n   - Lines 456-458: Report dialog tests check dialog visibility and active tab. These check that the dialog opens, but the \"navigation\" here is actually opening a modal, not navigating. The tests verify the dialog opens with the correct tab. ✓\n   \n2. **When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages, tests must interact with that component on each page.**\n   - Not directly applicable here. ✓\n\n3. **For actions that produce side effects, verify both primary effect and side effect. Assert side effect happens exactly once.**\n   - Lines 366-412: \"BudgetDetailsTab item amounts reflect transaction data\" - creates a transaction, verifies budget amounts update AND budget overview updates. ✓ Good - tests both primary and side effects.\n\n4. **Avoid `getByText()` with common words. Prefer `getByTestId` or use exact matching.**\n   - Scanning through the test file to check for problematic uses of getByText with generic terms.\n\n5. **All `data-testid` values used across test files must be consistent.**\n   - Would need to check cross-file consistency. Let me check if there are other test files that reference the same testids.\n\n6. **For file upload tests, use actual file upload mechanics (setInputFiles).**\n   - No file upload tests in this file. N/A. ✓\n\n7. **NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait inside `.toPass()` retry block.**\n   - No `.toPass()` usage in this file. ✓\n\n8. **Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks.**\n   - No `beforeEach` hooks in this file. ✓\n\n9. **Use generous timeouts for assertions that depend on backend round-trips.**\n   - Checking timeout values across the test file to ensure they're adequate for async operations. ✓\n\n10. **For multi-step flows, add `test.slow()`.**\n    - The transaction creation test properly marks itself as slow. ✓\n\n11. **Test titles must match test entry titles.**\n    - Verifying that test names align with their actual content and purpose. I'm verifying the remaining test cases for the transactions and budget details tabs, checking that the table renders correctly, the view/edit functionality works for both debit and credit transactions, tab switching operates smoothly, styling displays properly for different transaction directions, empty states appear when needed, and the budget line items with their progress indicators and over-budget warnings all function as expected.\n\nNow I'm counting through the test titles to reconcile the numbers—I'm getting 33 tests listed but the spec mentions 35, so let me recount to make sure everything matches up. I see I miscounted the TransactionsTab tests—it's actually 10, not 12. Let me recalculate the totals across all components: AccountHeader, BudgetOverview, and BudgetDetailsTab all check out at 6 each, TransactionsTab is 10, and ReportingLinks is 5, bringing the overall count to 33 tests instead of 35.\n\nNow I'm looking at the View/Edit test more carefully. The spec says the modal should show the transaction details including date, description, amount, and account allocations, but the test only verifies description and date. That's a gap—I need to check whether the test is actually covering all the fields the spec describes. The test spec says the form should be pre-populated with date, description, amount, and affected accounts with debit/credit allocations, but the actual tests only verify date and description — that's a clear violation of the directive that requires testing each described interaction. I need to flag this as a fix task. The parallel test design looks good though, using targeted filters rather than relying on fixed record counts. than testid. While testid is preferred, this is still specific enough and targets within a specific row. Borderline but acceptable.\n\nLine 104: `const fill = bar.locator(\".budget-overview-bar-fill\");`\nUses CSS class selector. This is OK in context of locating child elements within a testid-identified parent.\n\nOverall, I found one directive violation worth flagging: the View/Edit tests not verifying all fields mentioned in the spec (amount and account entries are missing).\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The spec entry says \"amount: $125.50; affected accounts with debit/credit allocations\". In the modal, the amount is distributed across line items (debit/credit entries), not a single amount field. The modal doesn't have a single \"amount\" field - it has line items with individual amounts. So to verify \"amount: $125.50\", the test would need to check the sum of all line item amounts to confirm they total $125.50.\n\nLooking at the NewTransactionModal and LineItemsTable, each line item has dedicated testids for account, type, and amount fields. The current tests only verify the transaction description and date, which means they're missing assertions on the line item pre-population. This is a clear violation of the directive requiring tests to exercise the exact fields described in the spec.
