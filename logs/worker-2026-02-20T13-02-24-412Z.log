Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   185→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   186→\n   187→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   188→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   189→\n   190→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   191→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   192→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   193→\n   194→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   195→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   196→\n   197→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   198→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   199→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   200→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   201→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   202→\n   203→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   204→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   205→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   206→\n   207→## Tips\n   208→\n   209→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   210→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   211→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   212→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   213→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   214→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   215→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   216→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   217→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   218→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   219→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   220→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   221→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   222→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   223→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   224→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   225→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   226→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   227→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   228→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   229→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   230→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   231→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   232→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   233→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   234→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   235→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   236→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   237→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   238→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   239→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   240→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   241→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   242→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   243→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   244→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   245→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   246→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   247→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   248→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   249→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   250→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"489b958e-9ccf-420b-9e0b-7c287e8dfd87","uuid":"4c1b5f2e-0c0a-43d3-a1bd-f6cd4b6ca681","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial testing job into a single group:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a group to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":250,"startLine":1,"totalLines":250}}}

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    30→\n    31→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    32→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    33→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    34→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    35→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    36→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    37→\n    38→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    39→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    40→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    41→\n    42→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    43→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    44→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    45→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    46→\n    47→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    48→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    49→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    50→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    51→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    52→\n    53→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    54→  ```ts\n    55→  await expect(async () => {\n    56→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    57→    const count = await cards.count();\n    58→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    59→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    60→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    61→    }\n    62→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    63→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    64→  ```\n    65→\n    66→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    67→  ```ts\n    68→  await expect(\n    69→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    70→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    71→  ```\n    72→\n    73→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    74→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    79→\n    80→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    81→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    82→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    83→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    84→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    85→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    86→\n    87→## Parallel Test Design\n    88→\n    89→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n    90→Write tests with this in mind:\n    91→\n    92→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n    93→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n    94→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n    95→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n    96→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n    97→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n    98→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n    99→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   100→  being unmodified.\n   101→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests.
