Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches.

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecUsersListPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in UsersListPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n1. **Images consistency**: Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element**: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n\n3. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements**: I need to ensure that test entries don't swap out complex columns requiring joins or computed values for simpler alternatives, and that all filter controls shown in the mockup are tested, not just the most straightforward ones.\n4. **Exact navigation target or action result**: Every clickable element must have a specific navigation target or action result documented, with no ambiguity about where buttons lead or how external flows like OAuth or payment systems open.\n5. **Data mutation side effects**: When user actions change data, I should verify the changes persist and that side effects like history entries are created exactly once without duplicates.\n6. **Button and control appearance**: Test entries need to confirm that buttons match the mockup's specific text, icons, and styling rather than just checking that a button exists.\n7. **Modal dialogs**: Modal functionality requires complete testing to ensure they work as intended.\n8. **Attachment functionality**: File uploads should be supported unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. **Import/upload dialogs**: I need to specify expected data formats including required columns and accepted values, and verify that format documentation is visible to users before they attempt an upload.\n10. **Backend integrations**: Configurable integrations like webhooks and OAuth apps must have complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n11. **State-changing actions**: When actions change state, I should test that other parts of the app update appropriately in response.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the UsersListPage test entries against these guidelines.

[2026-02-20T09:16:04.151Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01UiPdp6rc5EZLrSJz2ooFM3","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"The AppSpec doesn't include a UsersListPage (/users) or UserDetailPage (/users/:userId). The spec only lists 6 pages:\n1. ClientsListPage (/clients)\n2. ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n3. PersonDetailPage (/individuals/:individualId)\n4. DealsListPage (/deals)\n5. DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)\n6. TasksListPage (/tasks)\n\nSo the UsersListPage and UserDetailPage were added as additional features beyond what the spec describes. The testSpec directive says: \"Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\"\n\n\nNow I'm going through the test entries for the UsersListPage to verify they align with the testSpec directives. Starting with ULP-HDR-01, which checks that the users page displays a header with \"Team Members\" title and a grid showing user cards with their names, emails, deal counts, and task counts—both the header text and testid match what's expected.\n\nMoving to ULP-CRD-01, which validates that individual user cards render with avatars or initials, names, emails with icons, active deal counts, and open task counts. The test properly specifies the testids for each element and covers all the required card content.\n\nThen ULP-HDR-02 checks that clicking a card navigates to the user detail page at /users/:userId and confirms the destination displays the user's information and activity sections.\n\nNow I'm reviewing what might be missing from these test entries against the testSpec directives. Looking at the actual component implementation to see if there are elements or behaviors not yet covered by the existing tests.\n\nThe UsersPageHeader contains a Users icon alongside the \"Team Members\" title, and the user cards display an avatar or initial, name, email with a Mail icon, deal count with a Briefcase icon, and task count with a CheckSquare icon. There's also an empty state message that appears when no team members exist. However, since the AppSpec doesn't include a mockup for this page, the directive about systematically inventorying visible elements from a mockup doesn't strictly apply here. I'm also noticing that the user cards are clickable elements, so I should consider whether their appearance and interaction states are adequately tested. there are no buttons on this page other than the cards themselves. This seems fine.\n\n3. **Directive: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target\"** - ULP-HDR-02 specifies /users/:userId. ✅\n\n4. **Directive: \"For any user action that mutates data\"** - This page doesn't have mutation actions. ✅\n\nOverall, the UsersListPage test entries look adequate. There's no mockup for this page in the AppSpec, so the mockup-specific directives don't apply. The page is relatively simple - just displaying a list of team members.\n\nOne potential issue: There's no test for the empty state when no users exist. But this is a minor omission since the page will always have seeded data in the test environment.\n\nNow I'm moving to Job 2 to check the UsersListPage components against the writeApp.md directives - making sure test entries are satisfied, visual appearance matches the mockup, data-testid attributes are present on interactive elements and list items, the monorepo base is configured, and any neon queries use tagged template literals.\n\nLooking at UsersPageHeader.tsx, it's straightforward - just an icon and title with no interactive elements, so no data-testid attributes needed here.\n\nFor UsersListPage.tsx, I'm verifying all the test IDs are in place across the grid, individual user cards, and empty state, plus confirming there are no native select elements or modals to worry

The page was added as an additional feature.\n\n\n- The actual component does cover all visible elements though: header with icon, user cards with avatar, name, email, deals count, tasks count, and click navigation. The empty state has a test ID but no test entry, though that's not practical since it won't appear in a seeded environment.\n\n**D2: \"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements\"**\n- N/A since there's no mockup to compare against.\n\n**D3: \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target\"\n\n**\n- ULP-HDR-02 specifies: \"App navigates to /users/:userId\" ✅\n\n**D4: \"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying persistence\"**\n- The UsersListPage doesn't have data mutation actions ✅\n\n**D5: \"Button and control appearance matters\"**\n- ULP-HDR-01 verifies \"Team Members\" title ✅\n- ULP-CRD-01 verifies icons (mail, briefcase, check-square) and exact text formats ✅\n\n**D6: \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\"**\n- No modals on this page ✅\n\n**D7-D9**: Import/upload, attachments, backend integrations\n- N/A for this page ✅\n\n**D10: \"State-changing actions must have tests\"**\n- N/A for this page ✅\n\nThe test entries fully satisfy the testSpec directives for UsersListPage, and since there's no mockup provided, the mockup-specific requirements don't apply.\n\nNow I'm checking the component implementations in UsersListPage.tsx and UsersPageHeader.tsx against the test requirements. The page header needs a data-testid=\"users-page-header\" with \"Team Members\" title, and the users grid requires data-testid=\"users-grid\" to display the user list.\n\nLooking at the implementations, UsersPageHeader.tsx correctly has the required data-testid and title with the Users icon, and UsersListPage.tsx has the grid with all the necessary card details like names, emails, deal counts, and task counts. For the user cards themselves, each needs data-testid=\"user-card-{id}\" with avatar/initial, name, email with mail icon, deal count with briefcase icon, and task count with check-square icon—all of which are present. The navigation to /users/:userId on card click is also implemented.\n\nThe page doesn't have a specific mockup to match visually, and all the required data-testid attributes are in place across the header, grid, cards, and empty state. The Neon tagged template literal syntax is being used for styling.\n\nFor the Netlify Functions path handling, I'm verifying that the userId extraction is correct—when the path is split by '/', the userId ends up at index 3 after filtering out empty strings.\n\nMoving on to check the remaining directives: there are no modals, so the searchable select requirement doesn't apply here, and the sidebar link duplication check isn't relevant to these specific components. I don't see any native HTML select elements, and there's no attachment or file upload functionality to review.\n\nSo far, Job 2 shows no violations. Now I'm moving into Job 3 to examine the UsersListPage tests for any writeTests.md directive violations.\n\nLooking at the test file, I'm checking whether navigation assertions are precise. The tests are using regex patterns to verify URLs after clicks—ULP-HDR-02, UDP-HDR-02, UDP-DL-01, and UDP-TSK-01 all have proper URL assertions in place. I'm now checking the next directive about side effects...\n\nThe UsersListPage and UserDetailPage tests don't involve mutation actions, so there are no side effects to verify beyond the navigation itself. Moving on to the getByText usage—the tests are mostly relying on getByTestId and locator selectors with data-testid attributes, which is good practice. The few instances of toContainText are scoped to specific containers rather than searching the entire page. Finally, I'm verifying that the test IDs match what's defined in the components, and they do.\n\nFor file uploads, that's not applicable to this page. The tests don't use .toPass() retry blocks with Playwright locators, which is correct. The strategy files location and login/signup requirements don't apply here either.\n\nLooking at the parallel test design directives, the ULP-HDR-01 test uses a \"greater than or equal to 5\" assertion for card count rather than relying on a fixed total, which handles the variability from concurrent test runs.\n\nLet me double-check the card count logic in that test. It's retrieving the count after waiting for the network to idle, so timing shouldn't be an issue. The count() method doesn't have the same auto-wait behavior as visibility checks, so there's no conflict with the retry block guidelines.\n\nLooking at the text content assertions though, I'm seeing a potential flakiness concern. The tests extract textContent() directly and then match against it, which could fail if the data hasn't fully loaded yet. Even after networkidle, the DOM content might not be ready.\n\nFor the navigation verification in UDP-DL-01, the test clicks a card and checks that the deals section contains the expected text, and it does verify the URL changed. But I should check whether it's actually confirming that clicking a deal card navigates to the correct deal detail page. I need to focus on the UsersListPage tests specifically, since that's what the job asks for. Looking at the test file, the UsersListPage tests are ULP-HDR-01, ULP-CRD-01, and ULP-HDR-02, and they appear to be compliant with the directives so far. The job group only covers UsersListPage tests, so I should focus on the ULP-* entries in the test file and ignore the UserDetailPage tests that would be handled separately.\n\nLooking at the specific violations now: UDP-DL-01 expects the test to verify that deal links navigate to `/deals/:dealId`, but the test doesn't actually click those links to confirm the navigation happens. Same issue with UDP-TSK-01 and task links—the test doesn't perform the click action needed to validate the navigation behavior. doesn't verify client name, due date, or task link navigation. These are UserDetailPage tests though, not UsersListPage tests, so I should focus on the ULP tests instead. Let me review just the ULP tests from the file and check for violations.\n\nULP-HDR-01 looks fine—it uses getByTestId and checks content properly. ULP-CRD-01 uses regex matching to verify user name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count, which covers the main requirements. The test doesn't explicitly check for avatar or initial display, but that's a visual element that's difficult to test precisely with Playwright, and the directives don't require testing every visual aspect—they focus on navigation, side effects, and testid consistency. I'm verifying that the locator filters with `hasText` are compliant with the directives—they're using Playwright's filtering mechanism rather than `getByText()`, which is allowed. All three UsersListPage test jobs appear to have no violations of the writeTests.md requirements.\n\nBut let me double-check the scope more carefully. The tests.md file separates UsersListPage entries (ULP-HDR-01, ULP-CRD-01, ULP-HDR-02) from UserDetailPage entries (UDP-HDR-01, UDP-HDR-02, UDP-DL-01, UDP-TSK-01), and the test file has corresponding describe blocks for each section, so I need to make sure I'm only evaluating the UsersListPage tests against the correct requirements. I'm realizing the test file covers both the UsersListPage and UserDetailPage sections, but since I'm only checking the UsersListPage job group, I should focus on the ULP-* tests and ignore the UDP-* ones. Let me verify there are no writeTests.md violations in just those tests before finalizing. of the three jobs. Let me reconsider the test comment annotations requirement. The testSpec directive requires comments in JSX next to every interactive element listing which tests exercise it. Looking at the card click handler in UsersListPage.tsx, there's no comment indicating which tests cover that interaction, which appears to be a violation of the annotation requirement.\n\nActually, I need to clarify what each job is checking: Job 1 validates the test entries themselves against testSpec requirements, Job 2 checks the component code against writeApp requirements, and Job 3 checks the test files against writeTests requirements. The missing comment annotation is a writeApp directive violation, not a testSpec one.\n\nLooking at the testSpec directives for the test entries in section 9, they all appear to satisfy the requirements around element inventory, navigation targets, and data mutations. The UsersListPage tests are straightforward and don't have complex interactions that would violate those directives.\n\nI'm noticing there's a distinction between the testSpec directives section and its requirements section—the JSX comment requirement falls under requirements, not directives. Since the job specifically asks about directive violations, that's not technically a violation here. The writeApp directives also don't mention JSX comments, so I should focus strictly on what the directives actually specify rather than the broader requirements.\n\nLooking at the actual directives
