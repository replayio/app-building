Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones.

A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory.

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"57c25699-035d-4704-9a62-db042672c7ba","uuid":"43252155-ad69-4ebd-ba23-067f24d0a7c8","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

I need to add 4 tests to the existing AppActions describe block:\n\n1. **Download Source Code button triggers file download** - The test spec says clicking should initiate a download. Looking at the AppActions component, it renders an `<a>` tag with `target=\"_blank\"` pointing to `source_url`. The spec says \"a file download is initiated for the app's source code archive (e.g., a .zip file).\" So the `<a>` tag opens the source URL in a new tab. I should verify clicking the button opens the source URL. The `completedAppWithSource` fixture already has `source_url: 'https://completed-source.vercel.app/source.zip'`.\n\n\n2. **Download Source Code button disabled for Building app** - Similar to Open Live App disabled tests.\n3. **Download Source Code button disabled for Queued app** - Similar pattern.\n4. **Both buttons positioned below description and above activity log** - I need to verify the layout order and check what data-testid is used for the activity log section so I can confirm the buttons appear in the right place in the DOM.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5378,"cache_read_input_tokens":32714,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5378,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"57c25699-035d-4704-9a62-db042672c7ba","uuid":"e88b1635-c34a-43b3-a81a-d899ec31d58c"}
