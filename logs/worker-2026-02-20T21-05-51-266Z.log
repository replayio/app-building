This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   193→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   194→```\n   195→\n   196→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   197→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   198→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   199→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   200→\n   201→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   202→\n   203→## Directives\n   204→\n   205→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   211→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   212→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   213→\n   214→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   215→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   216→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   217→\n   218→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   219→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   220→\n   221→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   222→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   223→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   224→\n   225→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   226→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   227→\n   228→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   229→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   230→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   231→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   232→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   233→\n   234→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   235→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   236→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   237→\n   238→## Tips\n   239→\n   240→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   241→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   242→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   243→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   244→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   245→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   246→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   247→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   248→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   249→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   250→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   251→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   252→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   253→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   254→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   255→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   256→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   257→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   258→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   259→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   260→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   261→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   262→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   263→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   264→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   265→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   266→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   267→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   268→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   269→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   270→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   271→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   272→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   273→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   274→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   275→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   276→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   277→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   278→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   279→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   280→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   281→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01TJCgPVd2urFbPkugw7jHVY","session_id":"00f3391b-791b-4379-a4ae-71e99e8e0f87","uuid":"ede4f450-83a8-42c2-9f19-c5e02fb13feb"}

OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   211→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   212→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   213→\n   214→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   215→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   216→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   217→\n   218→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   219→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   220→\n   221→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   222→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   223→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   224→\n   225→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   226→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   227→\n   228→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   229→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   230→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   231→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   232→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   233→\n   234→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   235→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   236→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   237→\n   238→## Tips\n   239→\n   240→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   241→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   242→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   243→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   244→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   245→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   246→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   247→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   248→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   249→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   250→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   251→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   252→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   253→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   254→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   255→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   256→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   257→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   258→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   259→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   260→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   261→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   262→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   263→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   264→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   265→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   266→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   267→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   268→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   269→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   270→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   271→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   272→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   273→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   274→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   275→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   276→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   277→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   278→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   279→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   280→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   281→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"00f3391b-791b-4379-a4ae-71e99e8e0f87","uuid":"ee7e3d80-7d2a-4027-b2af-92eac1de621b","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial testing job into a single group:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a group to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/[REDACTED]io/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/[REDACTED]-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":281,"startLine":1,"totalLines":281}}}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→## Tips\n    97→\n    98→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n    99→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   100→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_0173oNuCwQqxhAFoD8vApr45","session_id":"00f3391b-791b-4379-a4ae-71e99e8e0f87","uuid":"c4a29690-4bbf-4173-b13c-ba22fcf58a40"}

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   102→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   103→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   104→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   105→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   106→  being unmodified.\n   107→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   108→  you need to interact with.\n   109→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

Do not guess test IDs.\n   115→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   116→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   117→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   118→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   119→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   120→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   121→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   122→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_0173oNuCwQqxhAFoD8vApr45","session_id":"00f3391b-791b-4379-a4ae-71e99e8e0f87","uuid":"d6eb1f7e-70e1-4283-84d2-2e7fd7330cd5"}

Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n```\n\n## 2. `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md` - Directives Section\n\n```\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n```\n\n## 2. `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md` - Directives Section\n\n```\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n```\n\n## 3. `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md` - Directives Section\n\n```\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n```"}],"totalDurationMs":30755,"totalTokens":23473,"totalToolUseCount":3,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6661,"cache_read_input_tokens":14251,"output_tokens":2554,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6661},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me also check if there's a POST endpoint for creating individuals (not just the bulk import), or if I need to add one.\n\nLooking at the individuals.ts API:\n- `POST /individuals?action=import` - bulk CSV import\n- `GET /individuals` - list/search\n- `GET /individuals/:id` - fetch individual details\n- `PUT /individuals/:id` - update individual\n- `POST /individuals/:id/relationships` - add relationship\n- etc.\n\nThere's no simple `POST /individuals` to create a single individual. I need to add that endpoint.\n\n\nSo my plan is to add a `POST /individuals` endpoint on the backend for creating single individuals, then update the AddRelationshipModal to show a \"Create New Person\" option when no matches are found, with inline fields to enter the name, and finally wire up the PersonDetailPage to handle this new creation flow.\n\nFor the UX, I think the cleanest approach is to include a \"Create new\" option directly in the search dropdown results—when clicked, it switches the modal to show input fields for the new person's name (potentially pre-filled from the search query), creates the individual first to get an ID, then proceeds with the relationship creation. create new\" mode where the user enters the person's name.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The simplest approach that satisfies the spec:\n\n1. In the search results dropdown, add a \"+ Create New Person\" option at the bottom\n2. Clicking it shows name input fields (pre-filled with search query if any)\n3. The modal onSave now can either pass `related_individual_id` (existing) or `new_person_name` (create new)\n4. The PersonDetailPage handler creates the individual first if needed, then creates the relationship\n\nActually, to keep things simpler, I'll handle the creation within the modal itself. When the user clicks \"Create New Person\", the modal will:\n1. Show a name field (pre-filled with search text)\n2. On save, first POST to create the individual, then call onSave with the new ID\n\nThe cleanest approach is to have the modal manage the \"create new\" flow internally—when saving, it'll create the individual via API first, then pass the new ID back to the parent component. I'll also need to add a simple POST endpoint for creating individuals on the backend.","signature":"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

PDP-REL-04a (my new test) - toHaveCount failed\n2. PDP-REL-05 (existing test) - toHaveCount failed\n\nLet me analyze the PDP-REL-04a failure using the Replay recording. But first, let me think about what might be wrong.\n\nFor PDP-REL-04a: The test clicks \"Create New Person\", fills in a name, selects colleague type, then clicks Save. The modal creates the individual first, then calls onSave. The issue might be that:\n1. The `handleAddRelationship` in PersonDetailPage closes the modal and reloads data\n\n\n2. But the modal is also running `resetForm` after creation, and I'm seeing a potential conflict in the flow where `onSave` gets called after the individual is created, which triggers the relationship POST, modal close, and data reload, but then the modal's own cleanup also fires.\n\nActually, I think I found it - in the create-new path, the modal calls `onSave` after creating the individual, but the original code's `handleSave` for existing users has a different sequence than what's happening with the new creation flow.\n\nLet me look at the failing test more carefully. PDP-REL-05 was passing before, and now it's timing out waiting for the relationship count to increase, which suggests the relationship isn't actually being created or the data isn't reloading properly. The issue might be in how I refactored the form reset logic - I need to check if the non-create-new path is still working correctly with the new `resetForm` call. I'm noticing that `handleAddRelationship` is async and makes a fetch request, but in the modal's `handleSave` function, `onSave` is called without awaiting it. This means the form resets immediately while the async operation is still in flight, which could cause issues. However, looking back at the original code, this same pattern existed before my changes, so it's not a new problem I've introduced.\n\nLet me check if PDP-REL-05 was already failing before my modifications, and I should use the Replay recording to debug the test failure more systematically since I have that data available.","signature":"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

Either the `handleAddRelationship` callback isn't firing properly, or the `loadData()` refresh isn't actually re-rendering the list with the new item.\n\nLooking at the create-new flow in the modal: after creating the individual, it calls `onSave` with the new person's ID, which should trigger `handleAddRelationship` to POST the relationship and refresh the data. But I need to verify whether `onSave` is actually being awaited and whether the async operations are completing before the test checks the count. the modal closes correctly after the relationship is created, since `handleAddRelationship` sets `setAddRelationshipOpen(false)` once the POST succeeds, and the data refreshes via `loadData()`.\n\nBut step 28 is failing when it tries to verify the count increased. The test expects `countBefore + 1` relationships, where `countBefore` was 0, so it's expecting 1 total. That's strange though—if the test navigated to a person detail page with seed data, there should already be relationships there. Let me check the network requests to see if the relationship creation API is actually

In `PersonDetailPage.tsx` line 48: `fetch(`.netlify/functions/individuals/${individualId}/relationships`, {...})` was hit 1 time - so the POST to create the relationship also happened.\n\nBut the test failed at step 28 waiting for `toHaveCount(countBefore + 1)` where expected was 1 (countBefore=0).\n\n\nThe problem is likely that `onSave` in the modal is fire-and-forget without awaiting, so `resetForm()` gets called immediately and the modal closes before the relationship data actually loads back into the page. I need to check whether `loadData()` is being triggered after the relationship creation completes, or if there's a timing issue where the count assertion runs before the UI updates.","signature":"Er8LCkYICxgCKkA0Ahs5FIv1AkuMBCECMcWhG+lSsouRDc8DBTEvkSbXnbzEG9DuR2JcZPK+WaOnV4zYhkuI84ua3qnpUYQiXOzlEgxGJqpll8qdKzhmyugaDIChAYIebr8ZXzNshCIwPkV3tBXQJppzBf//dPKMaCiG7oq5gDEK06D60KcNSTEndWdiClTv8n3VNmIDOXA0KqYKaT+D1pKDpLb8W6EA9g4bCmux+EqnQkFIeC2i9JCUdKBiJ1ZG4OdbFLfgbdQsOJXtSYRdtioj02M+1aIbwKDQnD9cGnpFPJx6aPwVYQkvykRiSUN2zokYXIi4oBs7dWZk7s/9CUWo0yLsFo9pki22RcIcnpBoMZLPbocf5NW4ZLb095J9kgAFPhOTIY3+O9I5D+WCeNFSwjKFdTJK1S2ofQ/8ZLeY//1SfkYJFfHN7AG2v36sbR5d/JZvIKjsNldY3LkXukbTUOe3gFx/Vwtv6ewKPVZ760S8zsXrMNjejAKIqxq6z85hEZn1uGZWYdmYtIoneUGRxOy/4/htEEBj9nUs3tWlgMVuCt1OMm6iLl6iyRJXEHKq3y+mMjtqJ/PISG4ThNiuhz6Wa5J5wnyJV1wLb3kXmwvd9b0726Ik7NMMVfZlztMf7iYcrAqTW7pcubnXfFxG0xtTV+mnxTBEj1M/q483jM9+jmeeJYpR7exjhbUmF7cPMgkCD2FhO33Pu96mwrko//riMAv+6UHpWoaqTIqjzCqo0295yIuL9X1gp96lV+ThxU0gZGBCfnxZX47XUZmTSdrYdyiBnfLdbu/F7BFK6Od08TKktkffmqPqe3fRbnX4lKQZ98Xwaaw1IBvGna3t7aDQ882NZvYZJo/wR8x98S/ShNQrPdSSd3G9fGKs9BQBWVU8T8w2aNnOQlmuU7ezH7EOW+IvBSLeQWd1luSaewzDp1cpUE8m1BUQtEfYeUK8tnzJ7cM0T4/Y/S2TEaTYkcaBn5r5eWBCLNQW5uSDapLGTq/RVQ1uCwnjRt63nMMqdOPmjjokSI+eM/aJxD+Tuc3TQCHHS/IV+XJIIN4cL0CdMyiaPtj32NUN4moaS78QPTJDdxrUUOLfnAINvlDXlORi4loGWclsnAtZRtj+sRI2mwcTHrkuIWpbYiyMCwXzeljwKJQkc96wLTwNf87IXSLLBPaTobYAoy9c48c3TCIEbJv8cRFUP69ciScN+vAbpkSjOH685byEWBIdFWAtdy+eGJgU08WLBZRv9lXDS/su0t3UWMbqMc+l3Bal2jw8783DLIx02XUZmT9bmos0zUTyYGimQeCwhfvBgGqClaC9/L/O0zxGDzLHu6fsIlkje6KOeE85sdx+luS2e1PAC2axeuucCLQy0jTtUkFvU00o42HfeS+P5gyqBzQWBLvYRnSmMcrttRGqhW8lrmxvXZDCzGk0sbyVyG7cDxFmH0xU7NJLJVNULO805qneoW3zQXLGN84X06SpwMCzmzWxb99HiJLcyq3dmHZPVIIqxZScXU6+Ss1n6nyXhWuDc7BowZQJ1eorzUaGCuatRdgNMf+W+6HKwch5Dz/XYqfrfQ8iqPklnuBSqye8+t2Ldc0EOekWxJyIITtn7cOsgqM9yQMLiVG9DQTZNEpQTSRkCNMFRKClUF2cDfACJCMAK/hnj+ICpwra1OiEVYD77X+uG85i9lei+oWO++oTQ7Pk6Hq9QGMetbgxZRhkfS5cWNIM4XZy0qmchjTtC5gUrB9l4JfD/QxbPg0t8rXIOUfQLVJURVx4/YyquXGIYFvSxAAniH+XEZNnvEB/DaltqLVrsKV15Hi/Mw25B1gU5cY89lIt6STgR1Q/ZubHpYGe0SbvOS/gLy6lXAeILCG/+tr70n+/7CtQoM8Dw6g7d0wAVlQDRyzI/KIhOyGYBjuF5pR70xpIqOXiJaYrTre5RJFZX4oBOv1dVVTG3B8SaBxMzxgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1921,"cache_read_input_tokens":80170,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1921,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"00f3391b-791b-4379-a4ae-71e99e8e0f87","uuid":"d85252ef-2964-4316-bb70-5d5327d57108"}

But the test still fails on the count assertion, so the issue must be in how loadData triggers the Redux update. Looking at the coverage, loadData was called 3 times total with 3 dispatch calls, which means the initial load plus the reload after adding the relationship both fired.\n\nThe real problem might be that `fetchIndividual` completes and updates the store, but the newly created relationship isn't included in the response yet, or there's a timing issue where the test checks the count before the Redux state fully propagates to the DOM. I need to trace through the network requests to see what's actually being sent and returned—specifically checking the POST to create the individual and then the POST to create the relationship.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1169,"cache_read_input_tokens":82879,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1169,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"00f3391b-791b-4379-a4ae-71e99e8e0f87","uuid":"bc344ab9-7783-4557-a95a-20e9d25105d5"}

The fetch succeeded (line 27 hit 3 times, no errors). So the data is being refreshed.\n\nBut the issue is that the DOM still shows 0 relationship items. The data must be getting fetched but something prevents the relationships from rendering.\n\nWait, the test says the count before is 0 and expects 1 after. The person had 0 relationships initially, then a new one was added. Let me check:\n- The relationship POST was made (PersonDetailPage line 59, 1 hit)\n\n\n- loadData was called after (PersonDetailPage line 66, 1 hit)\n- fetchIndividual was dispatched 3 times total (line 25, 3 hits)\n\nSo the 3rd fetchIndividual should have included the new relationship. But the DOM still shows 0. There's likely a timing issue where the dispatch starts the async fetch but the component re-renders before it completes, even though the test has a 10-second timeout. Let me verify if the API is actually returning the relationships in the response.\n\nI'm wondering if the issue is that I counted the relationships before the list view switched, so I'm comparing the wrong state. The real question is whether the fetchIndividual response after creating the relationship actually includes it. Looking at the handleAddRelationship function, I need to check if it's properly waiting for the POST request to complete and then triggering a refresh of the person data.\n\nActually, I'm noticing something more fundamental - the modal's onSave callback isn't being awaited before resetForm runs, but that shouldn't matter since handleAddRelationship runs independently. The bigger concern is whether individualId is actually available in the component's closure when handleAddRelationship executes.\n\nLooking at the coverage data, line 58's early return check had zero hits while line 59 did execute, so individualId was definitely set. But if the API successfully created the relationship and reloaded the data, yet the DOM still shows zero items, the problem might be in how the relationships are being stored or rendered - possibly the Redux state isn't being updated correctly after the fetch.\n\nLet me trace through the actual network requests and the fetchIndividual response to see what's being returned.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1125,"cache_read_input_tokens":87971,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1125,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"00f3391b-791b-4379-a4ae-71e99e8e0f87","uuid":"e4f38bf7-1b61-481f-822e-7984efa00e51"}

The third time should include the newly created relationship.\n\nLet me evaluate the state at the last fulfilled point to see if the relationships are there.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The test times out at `toHaveCount(countBefore + 1, { timeout: 10000 })`. That means for 10 seconds, the count stays at 0. But the loadData was called, the fetch succeeded, and the state was updated. So the component should re-render with the new data.\n \nI'm wondering if there's a race condition where closing the modal triggers a re-render that somehow interferes with the RelationshipsSection receiving the updated data. Or maybe the issue is that when the modal closes, something about how the component is structured causes it to miss the state update from the thunk.\n\nLet me trace through what happens when `fetchIndividual` completes - it should return the updated individual data with the new relationships included, so I need to check what the actual response contains and whether the relationships are being properly merged into the state.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2253,"cache_read_input_tokens":89096,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2253,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"00f3391b-791b-4379-a4ae-71e99e8e0f87","uuid":"fcf0af47-c6ac-4a56-8c81-8ffdb0372e20"}

The state IS updated with `currentIndividual` that has 2 relationships. But the test expects `countBefore + 1 = 1` because `countBefore` was 0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The third fetch returns 2 relationships, not 1. Why? Because the person initially had 0 relationships visible (maybe because of the relationship query joining to the same client). Let me check - the initial query returned 0 relationships but after creating 1, it returns 2? That's strange.\n \nActually, I'm seeing that after creating one relationship, the API returns 2 instead of 1. Either there was already a hidden relationship that wasn't being returned initially, or a duplicate got created somehow. The test expects 1 relationship to show up (0 + 1), but the DOM is rendering 2 items, which is why the assertion fails.\n\nLooking at the timing more carefully - Point:35 was the last render check where I found 0 items, but Point:38 (the Redux state update) happened after that. The state update should trigger a re-render, so maybe that re-render happens after I checked the DOM, or possibly even after the test times out despite the 10-second window.\n\nThe test timed out at step 28 around 14665ms, with the 10-second timeout expiring at 24665ms. The recording goes to 25560ms, so there's barely any buffer. The critical issue is that the third fetch completion (Point:38) likely happened very late in the recording, possibly after the timeout already fired. The Save button was clicked at 13684ms, and if that fetch took unusually long, the state update could have been delayed past when the test gave up waiting. the third fetch is completing around 25000ms, which is past the 10-second timeout threshold at 23684ms—that's the root cause of the test failure. The three sequential API calls are taking too long. I could increase the timeout, but a better approach would be to have the test wait for the modal to close first to confirm the save and relationship creation finished, then allow adequate time for the data refresh to complete.\n\nLooking at the actual sequence though, the modal does close quickly at 14665ms when it checks `await expect(modal).not.toBeVisible()`. The real issue is that `loadData()` gets called after the modal closes, and that fetch operation is what's timing out.\n\nTracing through the code flow: when `handleSave` runs for creating a new individual, it POSTs to create the individual, then calls `onSave` as a fire-and-forget operation without awaiting it, followed by `resetForm()`. Meanwhile, `handleAddRelationship` (the onSave callback) POSTs to create the relationship and then calls `setAddRelationshipOpen(false)` and `loadData()`. Since `onSave` isn't awaited, the modal's save completes after just the individual creation, but the relationship creation and data refresh continue running asynchronously in the background—that's where the timeout is getting hit. the modal closes after the relationship POST completes, which triggers `handleAddRelationship` to call `setAddRelationshipOpen(false)` and `loadData()`. The test captures the individual creation POST first, then waits for the relationship POST to finish before asserting the modal is no longer visible.\n\nNow I'm looking at the timing issue — the full chain of individual POST, relationship POST, and the subsequent GET request from `loadData()` takes around 11-12 seconds total. The test assertion at step 28 starts at 15324ms with a 10-second timeout, which would expire at 25324ms, but the recording ends at 25560ms, so there's barely any buffer. I should increase the timeout to 15000 or 20000 to give the data fetch enough time to complete before the assertion fails. to check if the PDP-REL-05 test is actually failing due to my changes or if it's a pre-existing flakiness issue, especially since parallel test execution could be introducing data contamination from other tests.\n\nLooking at the recording metadata, both tests are timing out on the same `toHaveCount` assertion, which suggests the relationship creation and data refresh flow might just be slow in the test environment rather than a logic issue with my changes. For the existing person flow in PDP-REL-05, the test searches for a person, selects one, picks Manager type, and then intercepts the POST request—but the assertion is failing before it even gets there. still `true`). The modal only closes when `handleAddRelationship` succeeds and calls `setAddRelationshipOpen(false)`. The flow hasn't actually changed from the old code - `handleSave` would call `onSave(data)` and reset, but the modal stayed open until `handleAddRelationship` completed. So the test failure might be a pre-existing timing issue rather than something I introduced. Let me focus on what I can actually control here.\n\nFor PDP-REL-04a, I should bump up the timeout. But wait - the third `fetchIndividual` call returned 2 relationships when the test expected only 1 more. Even with infinite timeout, this would fail because the count would be 2, not 1. So this isn't just a timing problem - there's a data issue. After adding a single relationship, two are coming back instead of one. I need to figure out why the relationship query is returning unexpected results.\n\nThe query joins `individual_relationships` with `individuals` and then does a LEFT JOIN to `client_individuals`. I'm wondering if that LEFT JOIN is causing duplicate rows - maybe when the related individual has multiple client associations, it's creating extra rows in the result set.\n\nActually, looking at the query more carefully, the LEFT JOIN is constrained to a specific client_id from a subquery, so it should only match one row per relationship at most. If the person being viewed has no client associations, the subquery returns NULL and the LEFT JOIN won't match anything, giving us one row per relationship with NULL values for role and company. So this shouldn't explain why I'm getting 2 rows from 1 relationship - there must actually be 2 relationships in the database.\n\nWait, could parallel tests be the culprit? With fullyParallel: true and per-worker database branches, tests running on the same worker share the same database. If PDP-REL-04a and PDP-REL-05 are both running concurrently on the same worker, they could both be creating relationships for the same person - one adding a Manager relationship and the other adding a Colleague relationship. That would explain why the third fetch returns 2 relationships instead of 1. The real issue is test isolation - I need to either use different persons for each test or ensure they're not running in parallel.\n\nActually, looking at the assertion more carefully - if both tests run at the same time and both count 0 relationships before adding one, they'd each expect exactly 1 but end up with 2 total, causing both to fail. I could make the assertion more resilient by checking for at least countBefore + 1 instead of exactly that amount, though that feels like masking the underlying isolation problem rather than fixing it.\n\nThe better approach is to make each test verify the specific relationship it created exists in the list, rather than relying on count assertions. For PDP-REL-04a, I'd check that the \"Test New Contact\" relationship appears, and for PDP-REL-05, I'd do something similar. The testing guidelines warn against using `.first()` as a workaround for ambiguous selectors, so I need to find a cleaner way to verify the right item was
