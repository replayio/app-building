All entries are comprehensive and match the mockup.\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 2: CheckComponentsClientsListPage - Check writeApp.md directive violations in ClientsListPage components\n\nLet me read all the component files for the ClientsListPage.\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/ClientsListPage.tsx\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/ClientsListHeader.tsx\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/ClientsSearchAndFilters.tsx\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/ClientsTable.tsx\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/ClientsPagination.tsx\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/AddClientModal.tsx\nNow let me check the style guides for any issues.\n[read] /repo/apps/AppStyle.md\n[glob] apps/SalesCRM/AppStyle.md\nI notice the style guide says data tables should use CSS Grid, not HTML `<table>`. Let me check the CSS and look for other potential issues.\n[grep] data-table|clients-table|clients-page|clients-filters|clients-pagination\n[grep] \\.data-table|\\.clients-table|\\.clients-page\n[grep] \\.data-table\n[grep] data-table\n[grep] data-table\n[grep] table\nLet me check the backend function for clients to verify neon query patterns and other directives.\n[glob] apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients*\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/clients.ts\nLet me check the shared backend db module to understand the query pattern.\n[glob] apps/shared/backend/db*\n[read] /repo/apps/shared/backend/db.ts\nNow let me systematically check each writeApp.md directive against the ClientsListPage components.\n\n### Checking writeApp.md directives:\n\n**Checking: ClientsListPage.tsx**\n- ✅ Clean code, no TODOs or placeholders\n- ✅ All JSX abstracted into separate components (ClientsListHeader, ClientsSearchAndFilters, ClientsTable, ClientsPagination, AddClientModal)\n- ✅ Root element has `p-6 max-sm:p-3` padding (lines 118, 128)\n- ✅ Has `data-testid=\"clients-list-page\"` on root\n\n**Checking: ClientsListHeader.tsx**\n- ✅ `data-testid` on header container, all buttons\n- ✅ Icons present on Import/Export/Add buttons\n- ✅ Uses ImportDialog from shared components (not a native dialog)\n- ✅ No native `<select>` elements\n- ✅ Layout-agnostic (no outer padding)\n\n**Checking: ClientsSearchAndFilters.tsx**\n- ✅ Uses `FilterSelect` custom component (not native `<select>`)\n- ✅ `data-testid` on container, search input, all filter selects\n- ✅ Layout-agnostic (no outer padding)\n\n**Checking: ClientsTable.tsx**\n- ✅ `data-testid` on table container, empty state, rows, action buttons, menu items, status badges\n- ✅ Uses ConfirmDialog for delete confirmation\n- ✅ Status badges use color-coded CSS classes\n- ✅ Row click navigates to `/clients/${client.id}`\n- ✅ Actions wrapper has `position: relative` and `z-index` (line 75)\n- ✅ Layout-agnostic (no outer padding)\n\n**Checking: ClientsPagination.tsx**\n- ✅ Uses shared Pagination component\n- ✅ `data-testid` on container and range\n- ✅ Layout-agnostic\n\n**Checking: AddClientModal.tsx**\n- ✅ `data-testid` on overlay, modal, close button, error, all inputs, submit/cancel\n- ✅ Uses FilterSelect for Type and Status (not native `<select>`)\n- ✅ Form validation (name required)\n- ✅ No outer padding\n\n**Checking: clients.ts (backend)**\n- ✅ Netlify function path segments: index 3 for resource ID is correct\n- ✅ Empty strings converted to null using `|| null` for DATE columns (dateAcquired)\n- ✅ CRUD operations: GET list, GET single, POST create, PUT update, DELETE, POST import\n\nNo writeApp.md directive violations found for ClientsListPage components.\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 3: CheckTestsClientsListPage - Check writeTests.md directive violations in ClientsListPage tests\n\nFrom the earlier search, there are no Playwright test files for ClientsListPage. Let me verify this and check if there are test files under a different naming convention.\n[glob] apps/SalesCRM/tests/**/*\n[grep] ClientsList|clients-list|/clients\nLet me read the sidebar spec to see if it contains ClientsListPage tests.\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/sidebar.spec.ts\nThe sidebar.spec.ts contains only Sidebar-related tests, not ClientsListPage tests. There are **no Playwright test files** for the ClientsListPage.\n\nSince there are no ClientsListPage-specific Playwright tests, there are no writeTests.md directive violations to check against. The test entries in docs/tests.md describe extensive test cases for the ClientsListPage, but none have been implemented as Playwright tests yet.\n\nNo violations found because there are no tests to check.\n[TodoWrite]\n## Summary\n\nAll three subtasks are complete:\n\n1. **CheckTestSpecClientsListPage**: Systematically checked all testSpec.md directives against ClientsListPage test entries (lines 73-292 of docs/tests.md).

Verifies no extras (Dashboard, Reports). ✅ Directive: systematic inventory.\n2. **\"Clients link navigates to /clients\"** - Specifies exact navigation target and page displayed. ✅\n3. **\"Contacts link navigates to /contacts\"** - ✅\n4. **\"Deals link navigates to /deals\"** - ✅\n5. **\"Tasks link navigates to /tasks\"** - ✅\n6. **\"Team link navigates to /users\"** - ✅\n7. **\"Settings link navigates to /settings\"** - ✅\n8. **\"Active link is visually highlighted for current page\"** - Tests visual appearance. ✅ Directive: button appearance matters.\n9. **\"Active state updates on navigation\"** - Tests state transition. ✅\n10. **\"Sidebar persists across page navigation\"** - Tests cross-page persistence. ✅\n11. **\"Sign In button displays when not authenticated\"** - Tests visibility/absence of elements. ✅\n12. **\"Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form\"** - Enumerates all form elements (email, password, submit, forgot password, toggle). ✅ Directive: inventory all elements.\n13. **\"Sign In form submission with valid credentials\"** - Specifies exact result (authenticated, form disappears, avatar/name/sign-out). ✅ Directive: mutation persistence.\n14. **\"Sign In form shows error for invalid credentials\"** - Error display + form remains visible. ✅\n15. **\"Sign In / Sign Up toggle switches form mode\"** - Tests text changes. ✅\n16. **\"Sign Up form submission creates account (test mode)\"** - Covers both test and production modes. ✅\n17. **\"Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password\"** - Exact navigation target. ✅\n18. **\"Avatar and name display when authenticated\"** - Tests visual elements. ✅\n19. **\"Sign Out returns to unauthenticated state\"** - Complete state change. ✅ Directive: mutation and side effects.\n20. **\"Auth state persists across page navigation\"** - Cross-page state. ✅\n\n**Checking testSpec directive: \"There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\"**\n- SidebarNavigation.tsx: No JSX comments next to interactive nav link elements. **VIOLATION**\n- SidebarAuth.tsx: No JSX comments next to Sign In button, form inputs, submit button, forgot password link, toggle, or sign-out button. **VIOLATION**\n\nThis is a systemic issue — no components in the codebase have these comments. I'll add a fix task for the Sidebar components.\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 2: CheckComponentsSidebar\n\nChecking writeApp.md directives against Sidebar component code.\n\n**Checking NavigationSidebar.tsx:**\n- `data-testid=\"sidebar\"` on root aside element. ✅ (directive: testids on containers)\n- Simple composition of SidebarAuth and SidebarNavigation. ✅\n\n**Checking SidebarNavigation.tsx:**\n- `data-testid=\"sidebar-nav\"` on nav. ✅\n- Each nav item has `data-testid={`sidebar-nav-${item.key}`}`. ✅\n- 6 unique navigation links with unique routes. ✅ (directive: no duplicate sidebar links)\n- No native `<select>` elements. ✅ (directive: no native selects)\n- Uses `navigate()` for routing via React Router. ✅\n\n**Checking SidebarAuth.tsx:**\n- All interactive elements have data-testid: sidebar-signin-btn, sidebar-auth-form, sidebar-auth-email, sidebar-auth-password, sidebar-auth-submit-btn, sidebar-forgot-password-link, sidebar-auth-toggle, sidebar-signout-btn. ✅\n- All containers have data-testid: sidebar-user-area, sidebar-user-info, sidebar-auth-area, sidebar-avatar, sidebar-user-name. ✅\n- Uses tagged template literal syntax? No DB queries in component — N/A. ✅\n- No native `<select>` elements. ✅\n- No modals referencing other entities. N/A.\n- No attachment functionality.

No `getByText()` usage. ✅\n\n**Directive: Consistent data-testid values across test files:**\n- All sidebar testids are prefixed with `sidebar-`. Would need to verify against other spec files.\n\nLet me check for cross-file consistency.\n[grep] sidebar-nav-|sidebar-signin|sidebar-signout|sidebar-auth|sidebar-avatar|sidebar-user\n[grep] sidebar-nav-|sidebar-signin|sidebar-signout|sidebar-auth|sidebar-avatar|sidebar-user\nData-testid values are consistent across all test files that reference sidebar components. ✅\n\nContinuing writeTests.md directive checks on sidebar.spec.ts:\n\n**Directive: No `.toPass()` blocks with auto-wait semantics:** No `.toPass()` used. ✅\n\n**Directive: No unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach:** No beforeEach hooks. ✅\n\n**Directive: Generous timeouts for backend round-trips:** All auth assertions use `{ timeout: 30000 }`. ✅\n\n**Directive: test.slow() for multi-flow tests:** \"Sign In form submission with valid credentials\" chains signup → signout → signin → verify, has `test.slow()`. ✅\n\n**Directive: Complete e2e test for full sign-up and sign-in flow:** \"Sign In form submission with valid credentials\" exercises the full flow. ✅\n\n**Directive: Auth flows with email verification need production path tests:** The production email flow is tested in confirm-email.spec.ts and reset-password.spec.ts (separate pages).

Let me systematically work through each subtask.\n\n---\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSidebar\n\nChecking testSpec.md directives against Sidebar test entries in docs/tests.md (lines 3-70).\n\n**Checking each test entry:**\n\n1. **\"Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons\"** - Inventories all 6 links with icons. Verifies no extras (Dashboard, Reports). ✅ Directive: systematic inventory.\n2. **\"Clients link navigates to /clients\"** - Specifies exact navigation target and page displayed. ✅\n3. **\"Contacts link navigates to /contacts\"** - ✅\n4. **\"Deals link navigates to /deals\"** - ✅\n5. **\"Tasks link navigates to /tasks\"** - ✅\n6. **\"Team link navigates to /users\"** - ✅\n7. **\"Settings link navigates to /settings\"** - ✅\n8. **\"Active link is visually highlighted for current page\"** - Tests visual appearance. ✅ Directive: button appearance matters.\n9. **\"Active state updates on navigation\"** - Tests state transition. ✅\n10. **\"Sidebar persists across page navigation\"** - Tests cross-page persistence. ✅\n11. **\"Sign In button displays when not authenticated\"** - Tests visibility/absence of elements. ✅\n12. **\"Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form\"** - Enumerates all form elements (email, password, submit, forgot password, toggle). ✅ Directive: inventory all elements.\n13. **\"Sign In form submission with valid credentials\"** - Specifies exact result (authenticated, form disappears, avatar/name/sign-out). ✅ Directive: mutation persistence.\n14. **\"Sign In form shows error for invalid credentials\"** - Error display + form remains visible. ✅\n15. **\"Sign In / Sign Up toggle switches form mode\"** - Tests text changes. ✅\n16. **\"Sign Up form submission creates account (test mode)\"** - Covers both test and production modes. ✅\n17. **\"Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password\"** - Exact navigation target. ✅\n18. **\"Avatar and name display when authenticated\"** - Tests visual elements. ✅\n19. **\"Sign Out returns to unauthenticated state\"** - Complete state change. ✅ Directive: mutation and side effects.\n20. **\"Auth state persists across page navigation\"** - Cross-page state. ✅\n\n**Checking testSpec directive: \"There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\"**\n- SidebarNavigation.tsx: No JSX comments next to interactive nav link elements. **VIOLATION**\n- SidebarAuth.tsx: No JSX comments next to Sign In button, form inputs, submit button, forgot password link, toggle, or sign-out button. **VIOLATION**\n\nThis is a systemic issue — no components in the codebase have these comments. I'll add a fix task for the Sidebar components.\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 2: CheckComponentsSidebar\n\nChecking writeApp.md directives against Sidebar component code.\n\n**Checking NavigationSidebar.tsx:**\n- `data-testid=\"sidebar\"` on root aside element. ✅ (directive: testids on containers)\n- Simple composition of SidebarAuth and SidebarNavigation. ✅\n\n**Checking SidebarNavigation.tsx:**\n- `data-testid=\"sidebar-nav\"` on nav. ✅\n- Each nav item has `data-testid={`sidebar-nav-${item.key}`}`. ✅\n- 6 unique navigation links with unique routes. ✅ (directive: no duplicate sidebar links)\n- No native `<select>` elements. ✅ (directive: no native selects)\n- Uses `navigate()` for routing via React Router. ✅\n\n**Checking SidebarAuth.tsx:**\n- All interactive elements have data-testid: sidebar-signin-btn, sidebar-auth-form, sidebar-auth-email, sidebar-auth-password, sidebar-auth-submit-btn, sidebar-forgot-password-link, sidebar-auth-toggle, sidebar-signout-btn. ✅\n- All containers have data-testid: sidebar-user-area, sidebar-user-info, sidebar-auth-area, sidebar-avatar, sidebar-user-name. ✅\n- Uses tagged template literal syntax? No DB queries in component — N/A. ✅\n- No native `<select>` elements. ✅\n- No modals referencing other entities. N/A.\n- No attachment functionality. N/A.\n- Not a page component, so padding directive doesn't apply. ✅\n\n**No writeApp.md directive violations found in Sidebar components.**\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 3: CheckTestsSidebar\n\nChecking writeTests.md directives against sidebar.spec.ts.\n\n**Directive: Tests must verify navigation targets precisely (URL + page content):**\n- \"Clients link navigates to /clients\": Asserts `toHaveURL(/\\/clients$/)` and `getByTestId(\"clients-list-page\")` visible. ✅\n- All other navigation tests follow same pattern. ✅\n- \"Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password\": Asserts URL and `getByTestId(\"forgot-password-page\")`. ✅\n\n**Directive: Tests must interact with component on each page it should appear on, never use page.goto() as workaround:**\n- \"Sidebar persists across page navigation\": Navigates clients → deals → tasks → settings using sidebar clicks, not page.goto(). ✅\n- \"Auth state persists across page navigation\": Uses sidebar clicks to navigate between pages. ✅\n\n**Directive: Avoid getByText() with common words:**\n- All tests use `getByTestId()`. No `getByText()` usage. ✅\n\n**Directive: Consistent data-testid values across test files:**\n- All sidebar testids are prefixed with `sidebar-`. Would need to verify against other spec files.\n\nLet me check for cross-file consistency.\n[grep] sidebar-nav-|sidebar-signin|sidebar-signout|sidebar-auth|sidebar-avatar|sidebar-user\n[grep] sidebar-nav-|sidebar-signin|sidebar-signout|sidebar-auth|sidebar-avatar|sidebar-user\nData-testid values are consistent across all test files that reference sidebar components. ✅\n\nContinuing writeTests.md directive checks on sidebar.spec.ts:\n\n**Directive: No `.toPass()` blocks with auto-wait semantics:** No `.toPass()` used. ✅\n\n**Directive: No unnecessary state cleanup in beforeEach:** No beforeEach hooks. ✅\n\n**Directive: Generous timeouts for backend round-trips:** All auth assertions use `{ timeout: 30000 }`. ✅\n\n**Directive: test.slow() for multi-flow tests:** \"Sign In form submission with valid credentials\" chains signup → signout → signin → verify, has `test.slow()`. ✅\n\n**Directive: Complete e2e test for full sign-up and sign-in flow:** \"Sign In form submission with valid credentials\" exercises the full flow. ✅\n\n**Directive: Auth flows with email verification need production path tests:** The production email flow is tested in confirm-email.spec.ts and reset-password.spec.ts (separate pages). Not a sidebar test concern. ✅\n\n**No writeTests.md directive violations found in Sidebar tests.**\n[TodoWrite]\n## Summary of Violations Found\n\n**1 violation found:** testSpec.md directive requires JSX comments next to every interactive element with the titles of tests that exercise it. The Sidebar components (SidebarNavigation.tsx, SidebarAuth.tsx) lack these comments entirely. This is a systemic issue — no components in the codebase have ...

Let me start implementing the responsive changes systematically. I'll work on the CSS file and the component files.\n\n**Strategy for ClientsListPage:**\n1. **Header**: Hide button text on small screens (icon-only), wrap actions bar\n2. **Filters**: Padding adjustment, already has flex-wrap\n3. **Table**: Hide secondary columns at breakpoints, card mode at 480px\n4. **Pagination**: Wrap at small screens, reduce padding\n5. **Page title**: Scale down font at max-sm\n\nLet me start with the ClientsListPage components and CSS changes.\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/ClientsListHeader.tsx\nNow let me add responsive classes to the ClientsTable.

Let me start implementing the responsive changes systematically. I'll work on the CSS file and the component files.\n\n**Strategy for ClientsListPage:**\n1. **Header**: Hide button text on small screens (icon-only), wrap actions bar\n2. **Filters**: Padding adjustment, already has flex-wrap\n3. **Table**: Hide secondary columns at breakpoints, card mode at 480px\n4. **Pagination**: Wrap at small screens, reduce padding\n5. **Page title**: Scale down font at max-sm\n\nLet me start with the ClientsListPage components and CSS changes.\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/ClientsListHeader.tsx\nNow let me add responsive classes to the ClientsTable. I need to hide secondary columns at breakpoints. The 8 columns are: Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, Open Deals, Next Task, Actions. I'll hide Tags and Next Task at max-lg, and Type/Primary Contact/Open Deals at max-md.\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/ClientsTable.tsx\nNow add matching responsive classes to the td elements:\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/ClientsTable.tsx\nNow add CSS for card mode at 480px and responsive pagination/filters.

Let me analyze each one and write the analysis files following the shell commands report template.\n\nLet me summarize the shell commands found in each log:\n\n**Log 93 (03qkr9-93)**: checkDirectives for PersonDetailPage (SalesCRM)\nShell commands:\n1. `find /repo/apps -type d -maxdepth 1 | head -20` - find app directories\n2. `find /repo/skills -name \"testSpec.md\" -o -name \"writeApp.md\" -o -name \"writeTests.md\"` - find skill files\n\n\n3. `find /repo/apps/SalesCRM -name \"tests.md\"` - find tests.md\n4. `curl -L -o /tmp/person-detail-mockup.png \"https://utfs.io/...\"` - download mockup image\n5. `npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"...\" --subtask \"...\"` - add fix task (1st)\n6. `npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"...\" --subtask \"...\"` - add fix task (2nd)\n\nI need to re-examine the logs more carefully since the `$` lines mark the actual shell commands being executed.\n\nLooking at Log 93, I'm checking directives for PersonDetailPage by running a series of commands: first listing the app directories, then searching for spec and test files across the skills and SalesCRM directories, downloading a mockup image, and finally adding two fix tasks for the violations found.\n\nNow I'm moving to Log 94 to check directives for ClientDetailPage with a similar sequence of commands.\n\nFor Log 95, I'm tackling the FixViolationClientDetailFollowerNotifications task by searching for test files and checking line counts across the relevant documentation.\n\nFor Logs 96 and 97, I'm investigating the checkDirectives issues for ClientsListPage and Sidebar by listing available apps, examining task configuration files, and running find commands to locate relevant test files and components.\n\nNow I'm moving into the polishApp phase where I'm setting up 14 responsive design tasks across different pages in the SalesCRM app, checking the current CSS structure and identifying which pages need responsive updates. I'm seeing the pattern now—for the testFailures report, I'm creating a directory structure and then running multiple read-log commands to extract task information from the logs. I notice the output is showing task markers like `[Task]`, `[read]`, `[write]`, `[edit]` which suggests I'm parsing structured log data to identify what operations were performed.\n\nLooking at the next section, I'm realizing I need to distinguish between actual shell commands (marked with `$`) and the tool calls that appear in the logs. For the checkDirectives task on PersonDetailPage, I'm finding app directories, locating skill files, and searching for test documentation—these are the actual shell operations that matter for the analysis.\n\nContinuing with ClientDetailPage, I'm examining test documentation files and extracting their content to understand what directives need to be checked. I've executed six shell commands to gather information about test files and specifications across the repository, successfully locating test documentation and spec files in the SalesCRM application. Now I'm running another search to find all test files matching common patterns like `.spec.ts` and `.test.ts` across the entire codebase to understand the testing structure better. I'm now searching for notification and email-related files across the codebase, checking shared backend packages and directories to locate where the notification logic might be implemented.\n\nNow I'm looking through the SalesCRM app documentation and test specifications to find references to the ClientDetailPage and understand how followers are being handled in the tests. I'm reviewing the shell command logs more carefully now. Looking at log 96, I can see the initial commands like listing the apps directory and checking task files, but the output got truncated and I need to parse what's actually visible versus what's implied. Let me focus on extracting the concrete shell commands that were actually executed rather than getting caught up in the incomplete output
