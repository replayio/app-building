If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n     4→\n     5→## Unpack Sub-Groups\n     6→\n     7→Unpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n     8→\n     9→First, add a setup group:\n    10→```\n    11→npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n    12→  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n    13→  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n    14→```\n    15→\n    16→Then add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n    17→```\n    18→npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n    19→  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n    20→  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n    21→  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n    22→```\n    23→\n    24→## Guidelines\n    25→\n    26→- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary.

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   175→   on what you found.\n   176→\n   177→### Bug Writeup Template\n   178→\n   179→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   180→\n   181→```\n   182→# Bug: <test name>\n   183→\n   184→## Step 1: Evidence\n   185→\n   186→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   187→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   188→no evidence.>\n   189→\n   190→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   191→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   192→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   193→\n   194→## Step 2: Determination\n   195→\n   196→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   197→\n   198→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   199→\n   200→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   201→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   202→```\n   203→\n   204→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   205→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   206→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   207→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   208→\n   209→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   210→\n   211→## Directives\n   212→\n   213→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   214→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   215→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   216→\n   217→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   218→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   219→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   220→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→\n   222→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   223→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   224→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   225→\n   226→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   227→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   228→\n   229→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   230→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   231→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   232→\n   233→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   234→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   235→\n   236→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   237→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   238→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   239→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   240→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   241→\n   242→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   243→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   244→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   245→\n   246→## Tips\n   247→\n   248→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   249→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   250→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   251→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   252→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   253→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   254→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   255→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   256→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   257→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   258→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   259→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   260→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   261→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   262→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   263→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   264→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   265→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   266→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   267→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   268→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   269→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   270→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   271→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   272→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   273→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   274→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   275→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   276→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   277→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   278→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   279→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   280→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   281→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   282→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   283→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   284→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   285→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   286→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":289,"startLine":1,"totalLines":289}}}

This is the single entry point for running\ntests during development and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n   previous runs.\n\n2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n\n3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n\n4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n   test data.\n\n5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n   prior runs.\n\n6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n   `DATABASE_URL`. Capture the exit code.\n\n7. **On failure** (non-zero exit code):\n   a. Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n   b. Log full metadata for every recording that has test metadata in a delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, log `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>`.\n      On failure, log the exit code.\n\n8. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n9. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: Playwright test output, recording metadata block, upload confirmations.\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON.

The branch is created successfully, but the password from the template URL doesn't work for the new branch. This is likely because the password in the `.env` file has changed, or the Neon project's password has been rotated.\n\nThis is not related to the schema.ts fix at all. The schema.ts code is already correct - it properly uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` with no DROP TABLE statements.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The schema fix was already applied (no DROP TABLE statements exist in schema.ts)\n2. The test failure is a Neon database authentication issue, completely unrelated to the schema change\n\n\n3. The schema.ts correctly uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all 14 tables, making it idempotent\n\nBoth jobs should be marked as complete since the schema is correct and the test infrastructure issue appears to be a pre-existing environment problem. But wait, let me reconsider the test more carefully - the authentication failure when creating an ephemeral branch could stem from a stale template URL or rotated credentials. I should try running the test with the correct NEON_PROJECT_ID from the testing tips instead.\n\nActually, there's a mismatch: the testing tips reference `rough-lake-81841975` but the .env file has `mute-butterfly-91813942`, which suggests these are different projects. The .env should take precedence. Let me verify whether NEON_API_KEY is properly configured in the environment.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":590,"cache_read_input_tokens":41163,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":590,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6687d3cb-f06e-4727-a355-6577be9ef0cc","uuid":"1d910ae1-446c-416d-9dd0-5bbf4028d5a7"}
