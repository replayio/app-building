No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it contains subsequent changes to the spec from bug reports and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL.

Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings.

Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":116,"startLine":1,"totalLines":116}}}

Let me systematically check each job:\n\n### Job 1: CheckTestSpecAuth - Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication test entries\n\nI need to check the Authentication section of `docs/tests.md` against the directives in `testSpec.md`.\n\nThe Authentication test entries are in section \"0. Authentication\" of `docs/tests.md` (lines 7-35).\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n\n2. I need to inventory every visible element in each mockup—columns, filters, buttons, icons, badges, sections—and write a test for each one, not just the prominent features.\n3. Don't substitute simpler elements for what's shown; if the mockup has complex columns requiring joins or four filter controls, test all of them, not just the easier alternatives.\n4. Every clickable element must specify its exact navigation target or action result, not left vague.\n5. For navigation flows like OAuth or payments, I need to specify how they open (popup, redirect) and what happens when complete.\n6. Any action that changes data requires test entries verifying persistence and that side effects occur correctly—like history entries being created exactly once, not duplicated.\n7. Button appearance matters too; if the mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that exact appearance.\n8. Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they work properly.\n9. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n10. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format—required columns, accepted values, file type—and tests should verify that format validation works.\n11. Configuration UIs for backend integrations like webhooks or OAuth apps need complete setup instructions visible to users.\n12. State-changing actions require tests confirming that other parts of the app update appropriately; if there's a timeline or history feature, every mutation it tracks must create a history entry atomically to prevent duplicates from re-renders.\n\nNow looking at the Authentication section, I see it has test entries for the SidebarUserArea component covering authenticated user display, sign-in button visibility, and app loading without authentication.\n\nChecking these against the directives: the clickable elements seem properly specified—AUTH-USR-02 describes clicking \"Sign in\" to reveal a form, AUTH-USR-03 covers navigation to /clients, and AUTH-E2E-01 tests the full signup and login flow end-to-end. Data persistence and side effects appear covered by the end-to-end test. I should verify the mockup to ensure all visible elements are inventoried and that button styling is accounted for.","signature":"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

The authentication functionality seems to have been added as an extra necessary feature. Let me now check the actual Authentication components in the app.\n\nLet me also look at the mockup images to see if there's any auth-related info. But since I can't fetch the images (they're on utfs.io), I should focus on what I can check.\n\nLet me now proceed systematically with all three jobs.\n\n### Job 1: CheckTestSpecAuth\n\nLooking at the Authentication section of `docs/tests.md`:\n\n**Section 0. Authentication**\n- Components: SidebarUserArea\n- Test Entries: AUTH-USR-01, AUTH-USR-02, AUTH-USR-03, AUTH-E2E-01\n\n\n- The test entries cover the main auth elements like sign-in/sign-out buttons, user name, avatar, and form inputs, which seems fairly comprehensive for the sidebar auth area. I need to verify that each clickable element has a specified navigation target or action result, like AUTH-USR-02 specifying what happens when clicking \"Sign in.\"\n\n- AUTH-E2E-01 covers the full flow and verifies data persistence by signing out and back in, which addresses the mutation testing requirement.\n\n- The auth form is inline in the sidebar rather than a modal, so modal testing doesn't apply here.\n\n- Overall, the Authentication section looks solid—it covers authenticated and unauthenticated states, app loading without auth, and the complete e2e flow without obvious gaps.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the next section.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1856,"cache_read_input_tokens":58925,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1856,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8402aee7-3fe8-4bee-a470-0a89bff784ad","uuid":"608ea869-23db-4390-9843-917d960380b1"}

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecAuth — Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication test entries\n\nLet me go through each testSpec.md directive against the Authentication test entries:\n\n**Directive 1: Consistent navigation/styling**\n- N/A for auth specifically. The sidebar is consistent across all pages.\n- No violation.\n\n**Directive 2: Systematically inventory every visible element**\n- The SidebarUserArea component has these visible elements:\n  - When logged in: avatar/initial, user name, sign-out button (with LogOut icon)\n  - When not logged in (form hidden): \"Sign in\" button with LogIn icon\n  - When not logged in (form visible): email input, password input, submit button, toggle mode button, cancel button, error message (conditional)\n- The test entries systematically cover all these states: logged-in user display with avatar and sign-out, sign-in button and form inputs, unauthenticated app loading, and the complete signup/login flow.\n- I'm noticing the cancel button and error display aren't explicitly tested in AUTH-USR-02, even though they're visible interactive elements in the form that should be inventoried according to the directive.\n- However, since authentication wasn't part of the original AppSpec.md mockups but was added as a necessary feature, the strict mockup inventory directive may not apply here.\n- Moving on to check other directives — the clickable elements like the login button, navigation to /clients, and the full auth flow all specify their exact targets and actions correctly.\n- The cancel button in the auth form isn't tested, which could be a gap.\n- For data persistence, the E2E test validates that signup data survives a sign-out and sign-in cycle.\n- Looking at button appearance now — the tests reference data-testids for the sign-in and sign-out buttons but don't explicitly verify the LogIn and LogOut icons that appear on them, which might be another directive violation.\n- Most of the other directives don't apply to auth since there are no modals, file uploads, or timeline side effects.\n- Overall, the auth tests don't have major violations, though the missing cancel button coverage and icon verification are worth noting.\n\nLooking more closely at AUTH-USR-02, I notice it specifies four form elements—email input, password input, submit button, and mode toggle—but doesn't mention the cancel button that's actually part of the form. There's also a discrepancy with the icon that should appear next to the toggle. Looking at the Authentication test entries, they comprehensively cover the auth component's functionality—the sidebar elements are all accounted for in the code, and the E2E test implicitly validates error scenarios. Now I'm checking the writeApp.md directives against the Authentication components to verify that test entry requirements are actually satisfied by the implementation. I'm verifying that all the data-testid attributes are in place across the auth components, including the error display element. Now I'm checking the backend auth function to confirm it's using the proper Neon tagged template syntax for database queries, and I need to verify that empty strings are being converted to null for date and timestamp columns. - `auth.ts` line 101: `${authUserId}::uuid` — authUserId is generated via `crypto.randomUUID()`, so it's never empty. ✓\n   - No date columns being inserted in auth. ✓\n\n7. **Netlify Functions path index** — The auth function uses query params (`?action=signup`), not path segments for routing, so path indexing isn't relevant here. ✓\n\n8. **Searchable select for entity references** — N/A for auth.\n\n9. **No duplicate nav links** — NavLinks are unique: /clients, /deals, /tasks, /users, /settings ✓\n\n10. **Never use native HTML select elements** — No select elements in auth. ✓\n\n11. **Attachment file-type-specific icons** — N/A for auth.\n\n12. **Attachment must support actual file uploads** — N/A for auth.\n\nNo violations found for writeApp.md directives in Authentication components.\n\n## Job 3: CheckTestsAuth — Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication tests\n\nwriteTests.md directives:\n\n1. **Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click** — AUTH-USR-03 goes to /clients and verifies sidebar visibility without explicitly asserting the URL, but since auth doesn't involve page navigation, this isn't a concern. ✓\n\n2. **For actions that produce side effects, verify both primary effect and side effect, and assert exactly once** — AUTH-E2E-01 handles side effects after signup... signup, verifies user name, avatar, sign-out visible. After sign-out, verifies sign-in reappears. After sign-in, verifies user name, sign-out visible. ✓\n   - No timeline/history side effects for auth.\n\n3. **Avoid getByText() with common words**\n   - Looking at the test... AUTH-E2E-01 uses `toContainText('Sign Up')` and `toContainText('Sign In')` on the submit button. These are used on specific testid-targeted elements (auth-submit-button), not via getByText. ✓\n   - No instances of ambiguous getByText. ✓\n\n4. **Consistent data-testid values across test files**\n   - All testids used in auth.spec.ts match the data-testid attributes in Sidebar.tsx ✓\n\n5. **File upload tests must exercise actual file upload mechanics**\n   - N/A for auth.\n\n6. **Never put locator calls with auto-wait inside .toPass() retry block**\n   - No `.toPass()` blocks in auth.spec.ts ✓\n\n7. **Strategy files at /repo/strategies/jobs/**\n   - N/A, this is about referencing strategy file paths.\n\n8. **Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test**\n   - AUTH-E2E-01 does this: creates account, verifies post-signup state, signs out, signs in, verifies authenticated state. ✓\n\n9. **Parallel test design**: Tests create unique emails with timestamps, don't rely on fixed record counts, and use fresh browser contexts for unauthenticated

Authentication\" against all testSpec.md directives:\n\n**Test entries being checked:**\n- AUTH-USR-01: Sidebar displays authenticated user info in upper left\n- AUTH-USR-02: Sidebar displays sign-in button when not logged in\n- AUTH-USR-03: App loads without authentication\n- AUTH-E2E-01: Full signup and login flow works end-to-end\n\n**Directive: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup**\n- No dedicated mockup exists for Authentication in AppSpec.md (it was added as a necessary extra feature). Checking against actual component: the Sidebar.tsx auth form has a Cancel button (line 122-128) that is not mentioned in AUTH-USR-02. However, this is a minor supporting button, and without a mockup, this is not a true violation.\n\n**Directive: For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result**\n- AUTH-USR-02: \"Clicking it reveals an email/password form\" — specifies result. OK.\n- AUTH-USR-03: \"Navigate to /clients\" — specifies URL. OK.\n- AUTH-E2E-01: describes states after each action (signup → logged in, sign out → sign-in reappears, sign in → logged in again). OK.\n\n**Directive: For any data mutation, verify persistence and side effects**\n- AUTH-E2E-01: Verifies persistence by signing out then signing back in with same credentials. OK.\n- Auth actions don't produce timeline entries, so no side-effect concern.\n\n**Directive: Button and control appearance matters**\n- AUTH-USR-01 and AUTH-USR-02 specify data-testid values and text labels.
