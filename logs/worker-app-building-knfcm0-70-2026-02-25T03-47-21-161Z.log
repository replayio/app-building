[2026-02-25T03:41:44.776Z] Running task: 2 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md)
[2026-02-25T03:41:44.776Z]   - WriteShared: App-wide logic - write backend auth middleware with optional JWT verification for Netlify Functions in apps/shared/backend/auth-middleware.ts (extracts user from Authorization Bearer token, passes user info to handler when present, allows unauthenticated requests in optional mode)
[2026-02-25T03:41:44.776Z]   - WriteShared: List page components - write shared FilterSelect dropdown component in apps/shared/components/ (custom styled dropdown button with optional search input for many options, click-outside close, data-testid attributes), write shared ImportDialog component for CSV import (template download, column spec table, file upload, parse with quote handling, per-row validation errors), and write CSV parse/generate utility functions in apps/shared/utils/csv.ts

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01CxW8VnKdEXxrBbkVhfhBFB","session_id":"b1a44c46-9df2-43cc-a087-896791d4866f","uuid":"7180c129-79bd-4776-b651-8e57b0a1a163"}

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b1a44c46-9df2-43cc-a087-896791d4866f","uuid":"626e554a-f45d-4de4-9b0c-252e88c75cdd","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

[2026-02-25T03:44:06.014Z] {"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"toolu_01SEUKATz5pyqxz7JQaGEUd1","type":"tool_result","content":"     1→# App Revisions\n     2→\n     3→New functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n     4→\n     5→## Attachment Displays\n     6→\n     7→Attachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01H7AjVuGK1jP4tXnsBGVwix","session_id":"b1a44c46-9df2-43cc-a087-896791d4866f","uuid":"962af61a-03bf-461d-a9a6-8bcbfd486e06"}

Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me provide the final report.\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\nBased on my comprehensive search of the `/repo/apps/` directory, here are the findings:\n\n### 1. Netlify Function Files Found\n\nLocated in `netlify/functions/` directories across three apps:\n\n**Accounting:**\n- `/repo/apps/Accounting/netlify/functions/accounts.ts`\n\n**InventoryTracker:**\n- `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/netlify/functions/dashboard.ts`\n- `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/netlify/functions/dismiss-alert.ts`\n- `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/netlify/functions/categories.ts`\n\n**ProductionHub:**\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/netlify/functions/equipment.ts`\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/netlify/functions/equipment-notes.ts`\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/netlify/functions/recipes.ts`\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/netlify/functions/runs.ts`\n\n### 2. JWT-Related Code\n\n**No JWT libraries found** - Grep search for `jsonwebtoken`, `jose`, or `jwt` imports returned zero results. The existing codebase does not currently use JWT tokens for authentication.\n\n### 3. Netlify Function Handler Pattern\n\nAll functions follow a consistent pattern:\n\n**Handler Signature:**\n```typescript\nexport default async function handler(req: Request, _context: Context) {\n  // Implementation\n}\n```\n\n**Imports:**\n```typescript\nimport { neon } from \"@neondatabase/serverless\";\nimport type { Context } from \"@netlify/functions\";\n```\n\n**Common Implementation Pattern:**\n1. Check `process.env.DATABASE_URL`\n2. Initialize `const sql = neon(dbUrl)`\n3. Parse `req.method` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n4. For POST/PUT: Parse body with `const body = await req.json()`\n5. Execute SQL queries with neon\n6. Return `new Response(JSON.stringify(data), { status, headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" } })`\n\n**Example POST Handler (dismiss-alert.ts):**\n```typescript\nif (req.method !== \"POST\") {\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Method not allowed\" }), {\n    status: 405,\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n  });\n}\n\ntry {\n  const body = await req.json();\n  const materialId = body.material_id;\n  \n  if (!materialId) {\n    return new Response(\n      JSON.stringify({ error: \"material_id is required\" }),\n      { status: 400, headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" } }\n    );\n  }\n  // ... process request\n} catch (err) {\n  console.error(\"Dismiss alert error:\", err);\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Internal server error\" }), {\n    status: 500,\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Shared Auth Files\n\nLocated in `/repo/apps/shared/auth/`:\n\n**authSlice.ts:**\n- Redux slice for state management\n- Interfaces: `AuthUser` (id, name, email, avatarUrl), `AuthState` (user, isAuthenticated, isLoading)\n- Actions: `setUser`, `clearUser`, `setLoading`\n- Initial state: `{ user: null, isAuthenticated: false, isLoading: true }`\n\n**useAuth.ts:**\n- Custom React hook using Redux\n- Methods: `login(userData)`, `logout()`, `setAuthLoading(boolean)`\n- Returns: `{ user, isAuthenticated, isLoading, login, logout, setAuthLoading }`\n- Currently frontend-only, no token/JWT handling\n\n### 5. Shared Backend Utilities\n\nLocated in `/repo/apps/shared/backend/`:\n\n**db.ts:**\n```typescript\n- getDb(): NeonQueryFunction - singleton for database connection\n- query<T>(): Promise<T[]> - execute parameterized query\n- queryOne<T>(): Promise<T | null> - get first row or null\n- errorResponse(status, message): Response - standard JSON error\n- jsonResponse<T>(data, status): Response - standard JSON success\n```\n\n### 6. Current Dependencies (from package.json)\n\nNo JWT/auth libraries installed:\n- `@neondatabase/serverless`: ^0.10.4 (database)\n- `@reduxjs/toolkit`: ^2.5.0 (state management)\n- `react-redux`: ^9.2.0\n- `@netlify/functions`: ^5.1.2 (netlify function types)\n- No `jsonwebtoken`, `jose`, or other JWT libraries\n\n### 7. Environment Variables\n\nFound in `.env` files:\n- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (Neon)\n- `NEON_PROJECT_ID`\n- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`\n\nNo JWT_SECRET or AUTH_SECRET environment variables currently exist.\n\n---\n\n**Key Observation:** The codebase currently has NO authentication/authorization implementation on the backend. The auth files are frontend-only state management. All Netlify functions are publicly accessible with no token verification. JWT implementation would need to be added from scratch."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a68c56858bffdde60 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 30266\ntool_uses: 23\nduration_ms: 28877</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b1a44c46-9df2-43cc-a087-896791d4866f","uuid":"9d642996-9d15-41c0-ba55-a1fe7955552f","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Search the /repo/apps/ directory for:\n1.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile a comprehensive report of the design system, component patterns, and existing implementations.\n\n## Design System and Component Analysis Report\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of `/repo/apps/`, here's a comprehensive summary of the design system, component patterns, and existing implementations:\n\n### 1. Design System Files\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css`**\n- Defines all design tokens as CSS custom properties\n- Color palette includes:\n  - Background colors: sidebar (`#f0eeea`), base (`#faf9f7`), borders\n  - Dark theme variants for each color\n  - Accent colors (primary: `#4d7c5e`, light, dark, muted)\n  - Status colors: success, warning, error, info, neutral\n  - Text colors with multiple levels (primary, secondary, muted, disabled)\n- Typography: Uses \"Inter Variable\" with system font fallbacks\n- Sizing: Sidebar width (240px), scrollbar width (12px), border-radius (4px)\n- Shadows: Two elevation levels defined with rgba colors\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/layout.css`**\n- `.app-layout`: Flexbox layout with sidebar + main content\n- `.sidebar`: 240px fixed width, flex column layout\n- Sidebar sections: header, nav (flex 1), footer\n- `.app-main`: Flex 1, flex column with header and content areas\n- Navigation styling with hover/active states\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/common.css`**\n- Form controls: `.form-group`, `.form-label`, `.form-input`, `.form-select` with 36px height, 4px radius, focus states\n- Button variants: `.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--ghost`, `.btn--danger` with hover states\n- Data table: `.data-table`, `.data-table th`, `.data-table td` with hover effects\n- Badges: `.badge` with variant classes (success, warning, error, info)\n- Searchable select dropdown: `.searchable-select`, `.searchable-select-dropdown`, `.searchable-select-option`\n- Action menu: `.action-menu`, `.action-menu-item` with danger variant\n- Line items table: `.line-items-table`, `.line-item-row`, `.line-item-delete-btn`, `.add-line-item-btn`\n- Balance indicator section with structured layout\n- Utility classes: `.text-right`, `.text-center`, `.font-tabular`\n\n### 2. Component CSS Patterns\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/ConfirmDialog.css`** (Modal overlay pattern)\n```css\n.confirm-dialog-overlay {\n  position: fixed;\n  inset: 0;\n  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n  z-index: 1000;\n}\n\n.confirm-dialog {\n  background: #ffffff;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: var(--shadow-elevation-2);\n  width: 90%;\n  max-width: 400px;\n  padding: 24px;\n}\n```\n- Uses fixed positioning for overlay covering full viewport\n- Flex centering for dialog\n- Click-outside behavior: `onClick={onCancel}` on overlay, `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` on dialog content\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.css`**\n- Flex layout with items centered\n- Links styled as text with hover color change\n- Separator elements for navigation breadcrumbs\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/CommentsSection.css`**\n- Section layout with title and content\n- Comment input row with flex layout for input + button\n- Comment list and individual items with borders\n- Comment metadata styling (author, role, date)\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/CategorySection.css`**\n- Collapsible sections with animated chevron rotation\n- Grid layout for headers with icon, title, and total\n- Hover states for interactive headers\n- `data-expanded=\"true\"` attribute for tracking state\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/Pagination.css`**\n- Flex layout for pagination controls\n- Centered alignment\n- Button minimum width of 32px\n\n### 3. Existing Component Implementations\n\n**Shared Components Directory: `/repo/apps/shared/components/`**\n\n1. **ConfirmDialog.tsx** - Modal dialog with overlay\n   - Props: `open`, `title`, `message`, `confirmLabel`, `cancelLabel`, `onConfirm`, `onCancel`\n   - Returns null if not open (conditional rendering)\n   - Overlay click closes dialog, dialog content click stops propagation\n   - Uses `.btn--secondary` and `.btn--danger` button styles\n   - Test IDs: `confirm-dialog-overlay`, `confirm-dialog`, `confirm-dialog-cancel`, `confirm-dialog-confirm`\n\n2. **SearchableSelect.tsx** - Dropdown select component\n   - Props: `options` (id/label pairs), `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `testId`\n   - Uses `useState` for search text and dropdown visibility\n   - Shows filtered options in dropdown on focus\n   - Blur hides dropdown with 150ms delay to allow clicks\n   - `onMouseDown` on options to handle selection before blur\n\n3. **Breadcrumb.tsx** - Navigation breadcrumbs\n   - Props: `items` array with `label` and optional `onClick`\n   - Last item shows as span (current page), others as links\n   - Supports navigation callbacks\n\n4. **CommentsSection.tsx** - Comments/notes display and input\n   - Props: `title`, `comments` array, `onPostComment`, `placeholder`, `postButtonLabel`\n   - Input with Enter key support for posting\n   - Post button disabled when input is empty\n   - Maps comments array with metadata (author, role, date)\n\n5. **CategorySection.tsx** - Collapsible category groups\n   - Generic component with TypeScript: `<T>`\n   - Props: `title`, `items: T[]`, `defaultExpanded`, `total`, `renderItem` function\n   - `CategoryGroup` renders multiple CategorySection components\n   - Uses state for expanded/collapsed toggle\n\n6. **Pagination.tsx** - Pagination controls\n   - Props: `currentPage`, `totalPages`, `onPageChange`\n   - Buttons: First, Previous, Next, Last\n   - Disabled states for boundary pages\n   - Page info display\n\n### 4. Modal/Dialog Patterns in Apps\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`** (Large form modal)\n- Uses `.modal-overlay` and `.modal-content` classes\n- `.modal-header` with title and close button (X icon)\n- `.modal-footer` with action buttons (Cancel, Submit)\n- Form groups with labels and inputs\n- Complex form with validation (balance checking)\n- Click-outside closes modal: `onClick={onClose}` on overlay\n- Close button with SVG X icon\n- Max-width 720px, max-height 90vh with overflow-y auto\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/CreateReportDialog.tsx`** (Dialog with form)\n- Similar structure to NewTransactionModal\n- Report type selection buttons\n- Date range inputs with grid layout\n- Checkbox for options\n- Submit and Cancel buttons in footer\n\n**Accounting App CSS: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/index.css`** (Modal styles)\n```css\n.modal-overlay {\n  position: fixed;\n  inset: 0;\n  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n  z-index: 1000;\n}\n\n.modal-content {\n  background: var(--card-bg);\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: var(--shadow-elevation-2);\n  width: 90%;\n  max-width: 720px;\n  max-height: 90vh;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n  padding: 24px;\n}\n\n.modal-header {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  align-items: center;\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n\n.modal-title {\n  font-size: 18px;\n  font-weight: 600;\n  color: var(--text-primary);\n}\n\n.modal-close-btn {\n  width: 28px;\n  height: 28px;\n  background: transparent;\n  border: none;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  color: var(--text-muted);\n  transition: background-color 0.1s ease;\n}\n\n.modal-footer {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n  gap: 8px;\n  margin-top: 20px;\n  padding-top: 16px;\n  border-top: 1px solid var(--bg-border-color-light);\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Click-Outside Behavior Patterns\n\nThe codebase uses two common patterns for click-outside:\n\n1. **ConfirmDialog approach** (simple):\n   ```tsx\n   <div className=\"overlay\" onClick={onCancel}>\n     <div className=\"content\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n   ```\n\n2. **SearchableSelect approach** (with timing):\n   ```tsx\n   onFocus={() => setShowDropdown(true)}\n   onBlur={() => setTimeout(() => setShowDropdown(false), 150)}\n   ```\n   - Uses blur with 150ms delay to allow option clicks before dropdown closes\n\n### 6.

Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile a comprehensive report of the design system, component patterns, and existing implementations.\n\n## Design System and Component Analysis Report\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of `/repo/apps/`, here's a comprehensive summary of the design system, component patterns, and existing implementations:\n\n### 1. Design System Files\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css`**\n- Defines all design tokens as CSS custom properties\n- Color palette includes:\n  - Background colors: sidebar (`#f0eeea`), base (`#faf9f7`), borders\n  - Dark theme variants for each color\n  - Accent colors (primary: `#4d7c5e`, light, dark, muted)\n  - Status colors: success, warning, error, info, neutral\n  - Text colors with multiple levels (primary, secondary, muted, disabled)\n- Typography: Uses \"Inter Variable\" with system font fallbacks\n- Sizing: Sidebar width (240px), scrollbar width (12px), border-radius (4px)\n- Shadows: Two elevation levels defined with rgba colors\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/layout.css`**\n- `.app-layout`: Flexbox layout with sidebar + main content\n- `.sidebar`: 240px fixed width, flex column layout\n- Sidebar sections: header, nav (flex 1), footer\n- `.app-main`: Flex 1, flex column with header and content areas\n- Navigation styling with hover/active states\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/styles/common.css`**\n- Form controls: `.form-group`, `.form-label`, `.form-input`, `.form-select` with 36px height, 4px radius, focus states\n- Button variants: `.btn--primary`, `.btn--secondary`, `.btn--ghost`, `.btn--danger` with hover states\n- Data table: `.data-table`, `.data-table th`, `.data-table td` with hover effects\n- Badges: `.badge` with variant classes (success, warning, error, info)\n- Searchable select dropdown: `.searchable-select`, `.searchable-select-dropdown`, `.searchable-select-option`\n- Action menu: `.action-menu`, `.action-menu-item` with danger variant\n- Line items table: `.line-items-table`, `.line-item-row`, `.line-item-delete-btn`, `.add-line-item-btn`\n- Balance indicator section with structured layout\n- Utility classes: `.text-right`, `.text-center`, `.font-tabular`\n\n### 2. Component CSS Patterns\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/ConfirmDialog.css`** (Modal overlay pattern)\n```css\n.confirm-dialog-overlay {\n  position: fixed;\n  inset: 0;\n  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n  z-index: 1000;\n}\n\n.confirm-dialog {\n  background: #ffffff;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: var(--shadow-elevation-2);\n  width: 90%;\n  max-width: 400px;\n  padding: 24px;\n}\n```\n- Uses fixed positioning for overlay covering full viewport\n- Flex centering for dialog\n- Click-outside behavior: `onClick={onCancel}` on overlay, `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` on dialog content\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.css`**\n- Flex layout with items centered\n- Links styled as text with hover color change\n- Separator elements for navigation breadcrumbs\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/CommentsSection.css`**\n- Section layout with title and content\n- Comment input row with flex layout for input + button\n- Comment list and individual items with borders\n- Comment metadata styling (author, role, date)\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/CategorySection.css`**\n- Collapsible sections with animated chevron rotation\n- Grid layout for headers with icon, title, and total\n- Hover states for interactive headers\n- `data-expanded=\"true\"` attribute for tracking state\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/shared/components/Pagination.css`**\n- Flex layout for pagination controls\n- Centered alignment\n- Button minimum width of 32px\n\n### 3. Existing Component Implementations\n\n**Shared Components Directory: `/repo/apps/shared/components/`**\n\n1. **ConfirmDialog.tsx** - Modal dialog with overlay\n   - Props: `open`, `title`, `message`, `confirmLabel`, `cancelLabel`, `onConfirm`, `onCancel`\n   - Returns null if not open (conditional rendering)\n   - Overlay click closes dialog, dialog content click stops propagation\n   - Uses `.btn--secondary` and `.btn--danger` button styles\n   - Test IDs: `confirm-dialog-overlay`, `confirm-dialog`, `confirm-dialog-cancel`, `confirm-dialog-confirm`\n\n2. **SearchableSelect.tsx** - Dropdown select component\n   - Props: `options` (id/label pairs), `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `testId`\n   - Uses `useState` for search text and dropdown visibility\n   - Shows filtered options in dropdown on focus\n   - Blur hides dropdown with 150ms delay to allow clicks\n   - `onMouseDown` on options to handle selection before blur\n\n3. **Breadcrumb.tsx** - Navigation breadcrumbs\n   - Props: `items` array with `label` and optional `onClick`\n   - Last item shows as span (current page), others as links\n   - Supports navigation callbacks\n\n4. **CommentsSection.tsx** - Comments/notes display and input\n   - Props: `title`, `comments` array, `onPostComment`, `placeholder`, `postButtonLabel`\n   - Input with Enter key support for posting\n   - Post button disabled when input is empty\n   - Maps comments array with metadata (author, role, date)\n\n5. **CategorySection.tsx** - Collapsible category groups\n   - Generic component with TypeScript: `<T>`\n   - Props: `title`, `items: T[]`, `defaultExpanded`, `total`, `renderItem` function\n   - `CategoryGroup` renders multiple CategorySection components\n   - Uses state for expanded/collapsed toggle\n\n6. **Pagination.tsx** - Pagination controls\n   - Props: `currentPage`, `totalPages`, `onPageChange`\n   - Buttons: First, Previous, Next, Last\n   - Disabled states for boundary pages\n   - Page info display\n\n### 4. Modal/Dialog Patterns in Apps\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/NewTransactionModal.tsx`** (Large form modal)\n- Uses `.modal-overlay` and `.modal-content` classes\n- `.modal-header` with title and close button (X icon)\n- `.modal-footer` with action buttons (Cancel, Submit)\n- Form groups with labels and inputs\n- Complex form with validation (balance checking)\n- Click-outside closes modal: `onClick={onClose}` on overlay\n- Close button with SVG X icon\n- Max-width 720px, max-height 90vh with overflow-y auto\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/components/CreateReportDialog.tsx`** (Dialog with form)\n- Similar structure to NewTransactionModal\n- Report type selection buttons\n- Date range inputs with grid layout\n- Checkbox for options\n- Submit and Cancel buttons in footer\n\n**Accounting App CSS: `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/index.css`** (Modal styles)\n```css\n.modal-overlay {\n  position: fixed;\n  inset: 0;\n  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n  z-index: 1000;\n}\n\n.modal-content {\n  background: var(--card-bg);\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  box-shadow: var(--shadow-elevation-2);\n  width: 90%;\n  max-width: 720px;\n  max-height: 90vh;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n  padding: 24px;\n}\n\n.modal-header {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  align-items: center;\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n\n.modal-title {\n  font-size: 18px;\n  font-weight: 600;\n  color: var(--text-primary);\n}\n\n.modal-close-btn {\n  width: 28px;\n  height: 28px;\n  background: transparent;\n  border: none;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  color: var(--text-muted);\n  transition: background-color 0.1s ease;\n}\n\n.modal-footer {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n  gap: 8px;\n  margin-top: 20px;\n  padding-top: 16px;\n  border-top: 1px solid var(--bg-border-color-light);\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Click-Outside Behavior Patterns\n\nThe codebase uses two common patterns for click-outside:\n\n1. **ConfirmDialog approach** (simple):\n   ```tsx\n   <div className=\"overlay\" onClick={onCancel}>\n     <div className=\"content\" onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>\n   ```\n\n2. **SearchableSelect approach** (with timing):\n   ```tsx\n   onFocus={() => setShowDropdown(true)}\n   onBlur={() => setTimeout(() => setShowDropdown(false), 150)}\n   ```\n   - Uses blur with 150ms delay to allow option clicks before dropdown closes\n\n### 6.
