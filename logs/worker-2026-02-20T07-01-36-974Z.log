Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry.

This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    77→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    78→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    79→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory.

Let me organize the PersonDetailPage test entries and understand what I need to check.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecPersonDetailPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in PersonDetailPage test entries\n\nI need to check the PersonDetailPage test entries (section 3 in docs/tests.md) against the directives in testSpec.md.\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements. Prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images.\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n3. Don't cut corners on implementation—test all columns including computed values and joins, and verify every filter control works as specified.\n4. Every clickable element needs a clear test entry stating exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers, with no ambiguity about external flows or their outcomes.\n5. For any action that changes data, I need test entries confirming the change persists and that side effects are correct—like history entries appearing exactly once per action.\n6. Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test entry should verify that appearance.\n7. Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they function properly.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, with test entries verifying the format documentation is visible.\n10. Backend integrations need complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI with service-specific guidance.\n11. State-changing actions require tests confirming that other parts of the app update appropriately, like timeline or history entries reflecting the change.\n\nNow I'm checking the PersonDetailPage test entries against these criteria. Looking at the PersonHeader section, I can see the first two entries cover displaying the header information and navigating to the associated client, both with clear specifications.\n\nContinuing through the remaining PersonHeader entries and into RelationshipsSection, I'm verifying that the test cases cover the key interactions: editing and persisting person info, displaying relationships with view toggles, navigating between related people, opening creation forms in modals, persisting new relationships, filtering functionality, and rendering the graph visualization.\n\nNow I'm moving through ContactHistorySection and AssociatedClientsSection test cases, checking that contact history entries display chronologically with proper details, that adding and editing entries persist correctly, that filtering works by type, and that associated clients render as cards with navigation to their detail pages. I'm verifying that all the data mutations are properly tested for persistence across the database, and checking that the modal dialogs for creating relationships and entries are functioning correctly.\n\nNow I'm looking at whether state-changing actions trigger appropriate updates elsewhere in the app—specifically, I'm questioning whether editing a person's information should create a timeline entry on associated clients, since the PersonDetailPage doesn't have its own timeline section but the directive requires testing that other parts update appropriately when changes are made. Now I'm systematically checking each test directive against what's actually documented. For the PersonHeader, I see that PDP-HDR-01 covers the main elements but doesn't isolate individual contact details like email, phone, and location as separate test cases. The RelationshipsSection and ContactHistorySection both have their key components tested, though I should verify whether every interactive element like filters and the add entry buttons are explicitly covered.\n\nMoving through the AssociatedClientsSection, the cards with client information and the detail page navigation are accounted for. The Graph View in RelationshipsSection is tested, though the description is fairly high-level. For clickable elements, I'm confirming that the navigation targets are properly specified—PDP-HDR-02 points to /clients/<clientId>, PDP-REL-03 to /individuals/<individualId>, and PDP-AC-02 also to /clients/<clientId>.\n\nNow I'm checking whether contact history entries themselves are clickable or if only the edit icon triggers an action, and whether clicking a client name on the Associated Clients cards navigates anywhere or if only the dedicated button does. For data mutations, I notice PDP-HDR-04 confirms the database persistence when editing person info but doesn't address whether this change should cascade to related client timelines, and PDP-REL-05 similarly verifies persistence without checking for downstream side effects.\n\nThe contact history tests do cover persistence for both adding and editing entries. I'm also verifying that Save/Cancel buttons appear in the relationship and contact history modals, and that the modal workflows for creating relationships and contact history entries are fully tested end-to-end.\n\nHowever, I notice there's no coverage for the Cancel button functionality on these modals—that's a gap in the \"completely test modal dialogs\" directive. More significantly, I'm not seeing cross-cutting tests that verify mutations on the PersonDetailPage propagate elsewhere, like checking if a new relationship appears on the related person's page or if edits to person details show up on the ClientDetailPage.\n\nI should also consider whether delete operations exist for relationships or contact history entries. The component descriptions don't explicitly mention them, but if the UI supports deletion, those interactions need test coverage too. Let me focus on the actual violations rather than speculating—the test entries seem reasonably comprehensive overall, though the searchable select for person references in the relationship modal aligns well with the directives.\n\nThe real question is whether I'm missing coverage for modal cancellation flows or delete actions that might exist in the built component.

Let me systematically go through each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecPersonDetailPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in PersonDetailPage test entries\n\nLet me check each testSpec.md directive against the PersonDetailPage test entries in docs/tests.md:\n\n### testSpec.md Directives:\n\n**D1: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n\nPersonDetailPage components and their test coverage:\n- PersonHeader: PDP-HDR-01 through PDP-HDR-05 ✓\n\n\n- RelationshipsSection: PDP-REL-01 through PDP-REL-07 ✓\n- ContactHistorySection: PDP-CH-01 through PDP-CH-07 ✓\n- AssociatedClientsSection: PDP-AC-01 and PDP-AC-02 ✓\n\nI'm noticing the breadcrumb navigation in PersonDetailPage.tsx isn't covered by any test entry, even though it's a clickable element that routes back to the clients page.\n\nLooking at the navigation requirements, I've got test entries for the header, relationships, and associated clients links, but the breadcrumb's \"Clients\" link is missing coverage. That's a gap I need to address since every interactive element should have a corresponding test entry specifying its target.\n\nNow checking the mutation side effects — the persistence entries look good, but I'm wondering about timeline implications. The spec mentions that history entries should be created for mutations, but since PersonDetailPage doesn't maintain its own timeline and the backend endpoint doesn't generate timeline entries, there's nothing to verify here. Let me double-check the backend behavior to confirm.\n\nLooking at all the mutation endpoints available, none of them create timeline entries — whether it's updating person info, managing relationships, or handling contact history. So the directive about timeline side effects is satisfied simply because there are no timeline side effects to test.\n\nMoving on to button appearance requirements — I need to verify that UI elements match the mockup specifications, like checking for specific icons and labels.\n\nNow I'm checking the modal dialogs more thoroughly. The Add Relationship and Add Contact History modals are being opened and used in tests, and the Edit Contact History modal is covered too. But I'm noticing the tests don't explicitly verify the Cancel button behavior on those modals — that's a gap I should address.\n\nLooking at the test spec pattern across other pages, they also test for the presence of Save/Cancel buttons without always testing the Cancel functionality itself, so this is a minor inconsistency rather than a critical oversight.\n\nFor attachments and import dialogs, those aren't applicable to the PersonDetailPage, so I can skip those requirements.\n\nOn the state-changing actions front, while mutations like adding a relationship could theoretically appear on the other person's profile, the cross-cutting tests don't actually cover mutations performed on PersonDetailPage itself—they only cover creating a person on ClientDetailPage and then navigating to PersonDetailPage. This means there's a potential gap in testing whether relationship changes propagate across the app.\n\nLooking at what's actually missing from the test entries, I'm noticing two key violations: the breadcrumb navigation to /clients isn't covered by any test, which violates the interactive element requirements, and the backend supports deleting relationships but the component doesn't expose a delete button for them, which contradicts the directive about supporting DELETE operations when the backend provides them.\n\nThe contact history deletion is the same situation—the backend supports it but the UI doesn't implement it. As for PDP-HDR-04, it mentions the change persists but doesn't explicitly verify the data survives a page reload like some other entries do, though that's more of a stylistic inconsistency than a real violation.\n\nLooking at the breadcrumb more carefully, it is a visible interactive element with a clickable link, so it should have a test entry according to the directive. But breadcrumbs are typically navigation elements, and there might already be coverage through the sidebar navigation tests. I'm realizing the directive specifically targets mockup elements, and since I can't access the mockup directly, I need to determine whether the breadcrumb's absence from the test inventory represents a genuine gap or simply wasn't part of the original design—I'll need to check the mockup to resolve this uncertainty.\n\nNow I'm comparing the component descriptions against their test coverage: PersonHeader checks all the required fields like name, title, and contact info, while RelationshipsSection has tests covering the toggle between views, list entries, navigation, and the add functionality.\n\nContactHistorySection appears fully tested with entries PDP-CH-01 through PDP-CH-07 validating the chronological log with interaction types and edit capabilities. AssociatedClientsSection shows card display and navigation working, though there seems to be something incomplete about the coverage there.\n\nLooking at specific test cases like PDP-REL-05 and PDP-CH-04, they correctly validate that relationships and contact history entries persist and display properly in their respective lists. After reviewing the test entries against the component descriptions and the testSpec.md requirements, I'm not finding any clear directive violations—the coverage spans all the described components and their key interactions, with the breadcrumb being more of an implementation detail than a tested requirement.\n\nThe delete operations are interesting though. The backend supports deleting relationships and contact history entries, and writeApp.md would require delete buttons in the UI if those operations exist. But that's a writeApp.md concern, not testSpec.md. For testSpec.md, the rule is that every interactive element needs test coverage, so if delete buttons were present, they'd need tests. Since they're not currently in the UI, there's nothing to test here—though the missing delete buttons themselves would be a writeApp.md violation I should flag separately.\n\nActually, rereading the testSpec directive about adding necessary features beyond the spec, I realize delete functionality should probably be included in the test spec since the backend supports it. But that's about writing the test spec correctly, not evaluating what's already there. The real issue is that the UI is missing this functionality in the first place.\n\nSo for Job 1, I'm concluding there are no significant testSpec.md violations in the PersonDetailPage test entries—they appropriately cover the components and interactive elements that actually exist. Now I need to check whether data mutations are being tested correctly, particularly around persistence and side effects.\n\nLooking at the state-changing actions, PDP-REL-05 tests that a relationship change persists but doesn't verify it appears on the other person's page, which could be a cross-cutting concern. PDP-CH-04 covers the history entry itself, and PDP-HDR-04 covers person info changes—both seem adequate since these changes don't significantly affect other pages.\n\nI'm satisfied with my assessment for Job 1. Moving on to Job 2 and Job 3 now.\n\nFor Job 2, I need to check the PersonDetailPage components against the writeApp.md directives: verify each component satisfies its test entries, ensure visual elements match the mockup, confirm all interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes, and check the netlify.toml configuration for the monorepo setup.\n\nFor Job 5, I'm verifying the neon serverless driver usage in individuals.ts — all queries are using tagged template literals as required.\n\nFor Job 6, I'm checking the backend functions for proper null handling with DATE, TIMESTAMP, and UUID columns. In the POST /individuals/:id/contact-history endpoint, both date and team_member fields correctly use the `|| null` pattern, and I need to verify the PUT endpoint follows the same pattern.\n\nChecking the PUT /individuals/:id endpoint now — I'm noticing it uses `??` (nullish coalescing) instead of `||` for fields like name, title, email, phone, and location, which doesn't align with the directive requiring `|| null` for empty string conversion.\n\nBut wait, those are TEXT/VARCHAR columns, not DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID types, so the directive doesn't technically apply. The real issue is that if an empty string gets passed, COALESCE will keep it instead of preserving the existing value. However, looking at the PersonHeader component's handleSave, it's already trimming values and converting empty strings to undefined before sending them, so `body.title ?? null` should handle this correctly by treating undefined as null.\n\nNow I'm checking the Netlify Functions path parsing logic in individuals.ts to see how it extracts the resource ID and sub-resources from the URL path. I'm verifying that the custom dropdown implementations across all the modals and sections are using div-based components instead of native HTML selects, which they are. Now I need to double-check whether the PersonHeader component aligns with the PDP-HDR specification requirements.\n\nLooking at the header entries, it displays the person's name, title with associated companies, and contact details with icons, which matches PDP-HDR-01. The client links navigate correctly to the ClientDetailPage, the header supports edit mode for all fields, and updates persist to the backend. I'm noticing PDP-HDR-05 appears to be listed under PersonDetailPage but seems like it might belong to ClientDetailPage instead—let me verify what that entry actually specifies.\n\nThe RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, and AssociatedClientsSection all have their corresponding test entries covered by the component implementation. For the AssociatedClientsSection specifically, the client cards display the necessary information and the navigation button works as expected.\n\nNow I need to check the data-testid coverage across PersonDetailPage.tsx to ensure all the required test identifiers are in place.\n\nLooking at PersonDetailPage.tsx, I have person-detail-loading, person-detail-page, and person-detail-breadcrumb covered. There's a small gap where the \"Clients\" link in the breadcrumb itself doesn't have a data-testid, though the breadcrumb container does—but since there's no test entry requiring it, that's probably acceptable.\n\nPersonHeader.tsx has all the necessary test identifiers: the header container, edit form, action buttons, and all the input fields for name, title, email, and phone.\n\nContinuing through the rest of PersonHeader.tsx, I'm verifying the display elements for name, title, contact information, and the associated clients section with dynamic client links. Everything checks out.\n\nNow moving into RelationshipsSection.tsx, I'm checking the filter controls and dropdown options.\n\nVerifying the add entry button, view toggle between graph and list modes, and the list view components including individual relationship items with their name, type, and link elements. The graph view structure also looks correct.\n\nStarting to verify ContactHistorySection.tsx with its filter button and dropdown options.\n\nChecking AssociatedClientsSection.tsx components...\n\ncontinuing with the remaining associated client attributes, then moving through AddRelationshipModal.tsx and AddContactHistoryModal.tsx to verify all the data attributes are properly implemented.\n\nNow I'm checking EditContactHistoryModal.tsx and confirming those attributes are in place as well. Everything's checking out so far.\n\nI'm starting to identify some writeApp.md violations—looks like there's a backend DELETE operation that needs attention.\n\nThe backend supports deleting relationships and contact history entries, but the UI doesn't expose delete buttons for either. That's a clear gap between what the backend can do and what the frontend allows users to do.\n\nI'm also noticing a potential layout issue—need to verify whether PersonDetailPage is adding outer padding when it shouldn't be.\n\nChecking the component structure now. PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, and ContactHistorySection all have margin-bottom applied to their root elements, which violates the layout-agnostic principle. Components shouldn't dictate their own spacing in the layout—that's the page's responsibility.\n\nWait, I need to clarify something. The margin rule is listed under \"Tips\" in the writeApp.md, not under \"Directives\". Since I'm specifically checking for directive violations, these margin issues might not actually count as violations. Let me focus on the actual directives instead and go through them systematically to see what's really broken.\n\nLooking at the directives, most are satisfied. But I should double-check the test entry requirements — PDP-HDR-01 specifies contact info with specific icons and formats, and the component does show the mail, phone, and map pin icons with the correct information, so that's matching up correctly.\n\nFor the associated clients section, PDP-HDR-01 also requires clickable links, which the component provides. Then PDP-AC-01 lays out what the client cards need: an icon, name, status badge, industry field, and a detail page button — all of which are present in the component.\n\nThe real gap I'm seeing is that the backend supports DELETE operations for relationships and contact history entries, but the component doesn't expose delete buttons for those items.\n\nNow I'm checking the writeTests.md directives for the PersonDetailPage tests. The first directive requires that navigation assertions verify the actual URL or page content after clicking, not just that a handler exists. PDP-HDR-02 correctly asserts the URL with a regex pattern for the client route.\n\nThe second directive about side effects doesn't apply here since PersonDetailPage has no timeline. For the third directive about avoiding `getByText()` with common words, the PDP-REL-04 test uses `getByText('Person *')` and `getByText('Relationship Type *')` within a modal scope. The asterisk makes these labels specific enough that they're unlikely to match unintended elements, so this usage seems acceptable.\n\nHowever, PDP-CH-03 uses `getByText('Type *')` which is quite short and could be ambiguous. The tests also use `getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' })` and `getByRole('button', { name: 'Cancel' })` which are fine since they use getByRole with exact name matching. Looking back at the directive more carefully, it emphasizes using `getByTestId` for precise targeting or `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching, so I should reconsider whether some of these `getByText()` calls should be replaced with `getByTestId` for better robustness. the directive, getByTestId would be safer, though it's more of a preference than a strict requirement. I'm also verifying that all data-testid values in PersonDetailPage are used consistently across the test files—they match the component code, so that's good. The test file doesn't use `.toPass()` with Playwright locators, which would violate the auto-wait semantics rule. File upload mechanics aren't relevant here, and I need to check where strategy files are located.\n\nLooking at the Parallel Test Design directives, I'm seeing that tests shouldn't depend on fixed record counts. The PersonDetailPage tests handle this well—the helper navigates to any individual without relying on specific counts, and tests gracefully handle empty states. But I'm noticing some potential issues that need attention.\n\nThe `isVisible().catch(() => false)` pattern in PDP-HDR-02 is catching errors unnecessarily since `isVisible()` shouldn't throw. More importantly, there's a mismatch between the test specifications and what's actually implemented—PDP-HDR-04 is listed as \"Saving edited person info persists the change\" but the actual test file has a different test with that label, and there's no test covering the actual data persistence scenario. I'm also noticing that the test titles don't align with the spec requirements—PDP-REL-05 should verify that adding a relationship persists and appears in the list, but instead it's checking whether the save button is disabled when the person ID is empty. And PDP-REL-06 claims to test filtering, but it only validates that the dropdown opens rather than confirming that the filter actually shows only matching relationship types.\n\nLooking at the contact history tests, there are similar misalignments: PDP-CH-01's test checks for a section with controls rather than verifying the chronological display, PDP-CH-04 tests button state instead of persistence, and PDP-CH-06 tests modal closure instead of confirming that edits persist. These gaps suggest the test suite isn't actually covering the core functionality described in the specifications. I'm noticing several spec entries that don't have corresponding test implementations yet. PDP-HDR-04 about persisting edited person info is missing, and I need to double-check whether PDP-HDR-05 actually exists in the spec or if it's been confused with another entry. Let me verify the complete list of PersonDetailPage test entries to identify all the gaps. -HDR-03 matches, but PDP-HDR-04 has the wrong test—it's checking for cancel instead of save. Moving through the relationships section, most tests align with the spec, though PDP-REL-05 is testing save being disabled rather than the actual relationship addition, and PDP-REL-06 opens a dropdown instead of filtering. The contact history section has issues too—PDP-CH-01 describes the wrong thing entirely, while the rest mostly check out.\n\nLooking at the rest of the contact history tests, I'm seeing a pattern: PDP-CH-04 tests save disabled instead of persistence, PDP-CH-06 tests cancel instead of editing, and PDP-CH-07 partially works but doesn't actually filter. The core problem is that several persistence tests have been swapped out for modal behavior tests across the file, and the test titles don't match what the spec actually requires.\n\nBeyond the mismatched tests, I'm noticing that PDP-REL-06 and PDP-CH-07 both have the same issue — they only verify the dropdown opens but don't check that filtering actually works. The spec clearly states relationships should be filtered by type and contact history should be filtered by date, but the tests just confirm the dropdown is visible. I need to verify that clicking a filter option actually applies the filter and shows only matching entries.\n\nI'm also scanning for violations of the `getByText()` directive — PDP-REL-04 and PDP-CH-03 use `getByText()` with common words like \"Person\" and \"Type\" when `getByTestId()` would be more reliable. These aren't strict violations but they don't follow the stated preference.\n\nNow I'm compiling all the violations I've found across the three jobs to determine which ones need fix groups. The main issues are missing delete functionality in the UI for relationships and contact history entries, even though the backend supports these operations.\n\nFor the test violations, I'm seeing mismatched test titles that don't align with the spec, plus several tests that verify cancel and disabled states instead of actually testing the persistence operations the spec requires. The filter tests for relationships also appear incomplete.\n\nLooking at the root causes, the missing delete buttons across both sections stem from the same UI gap, so I should tackle those together. The test issues—mismatched titles, missing persistence checks, and incomplete filter verification—all point to tests not matching what the spec actually defines, so I'll group those as a separate fix. to match spec entries\n- Implement missing persistence tests (PDP-HDR-04, PDP-REL-05, PDP-CH-04, PDP-CH-06)\n- Fix filter tests (PDP-REL-06, PDP-CH-07) to verify filtering works\n- Run tests\n\nActually, let me re-read the strategy guidance for adding fix groups:\n\n\"For any violations you find, add a fix group using `add-group`. Do not fix them immediately.\"\n\nSo I should add fix groups for these violations. Let me also consolidate related fixes:\n\nFor the delete buttons, I need to:\n1. Add delete buttons to RelationshipsSection and ContactHistorySection\n2. Add test entries to docs/tests.md for delete functionality\n3. Write tests for the delete functionality\n4. Run tests\n\nFor the test mismatches, I need to consolidate the title and implementation fixes into a single fix group since they share the same root cause, then run the
