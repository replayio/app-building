Now I have comprehensive information about the application structure. Let me compile my findings:\n\n## Application Structure Report\n\nBased on my exploration of the Sales CRM project, here's what I found:\n\n### 1. Documentation Directory (`/repo/docs`)\n\n**Contents:**\n- `/repo/docs/plan.md` - Contains a polish checklist for responsive UI across all pages\n\n### 2. Tests Documentation (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`)\n\nFound a comprehensive test specification file at `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (49KB) that documents test cases for:\n- **ClientsListPage** tests (sidebar navigation, search/filters, actions, table, pagination)\n- **ClientDetailPage** (planned, structure documented)\n- **PersonDetailPage** (planned, structure documented)\n- **DealsListPage** (planned, structure documented)\n- **DealDetailPage** (comprehensive test specs for deal header, stage progress bar, history, metrics, writeups, linked tasks, attachments, contacts)\n- **TasksListPage** (comprehensive test specs for header, filters, and task list items)\n\n### 3. Apps Directory Structure (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM`)\n\nThe project has a **monorepo structure** with a single primary app:\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/` - Main Sales CRM application\n\n**Key subdirectories:**\n- `/src/pages/` - Page components\n- `/src/components/` - Reusable components\n- `/src/store/` - Redux state management\n- `/docs/` - Documentation (tests.md, bugReports.md, bugs/, mockups/)\n- `/netlify/functions/` - Backend functions\n- `/tests/` - Playwright test specs\n\n### 4. Application Pages/Routes\n\nThe Sales CRM application implements the following pages (defined in `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx`):\n\n**Currently Implemented:**\n- **`/clients`** - ClientsListPage ✓ (fully implemented)\n- **`/tasks`** - TasksListPage ✓ (fully implemented)\n\n**Placeholder Pages (routed but not yet fully implemented):**\n- **`/login`** - Login page\n- **`/dashboard`** - Dashboard\n- **`/clients/:clientId`** - Client Detail page\n- **`/individuals/:individualId`** - Person Detail page\n- **`/deals`** - Deals List page\n- **`/deals/:dealId`** - Deal Detail page\n- **`/reports`** - Reports page\n- **`/settings`** - Settings page\n\n### 5. Page-Level Components\n\n**Implemented Components:**\n\nFor **ClientsListPage** (`/clients`):\n- `Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation sidebar with 6 links (Dashboard, Clients, Deals, Tasks, Reports, Settings)\n- `ClientsSearchAndFilters.tsx` - Search bar + Status/Tags/Source/Sort dropdowns\n- `ClientsActions.tsx` - Import/Export buttons + Add New Client button\n- `ClientsTable.tsx` - Displays 7 columns (Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, Primary Contact, Open Deals, Next Task)\n- `Pagination.tsx` - Page navigation controls\n\nFor **TasksListPage** (`/tasks`):\n- `TasksHeader.tsx` - \"Upcoming Tasks\" heading + New Task button\n- `TasksFilter.tsx` - Filter type dropdown + text filter input\n- `TasksList.tsx` - Task cards with priority badges, due dates, assignees\n\n**Modals:**\n- `ClientFormModal.tsx` - Create/edit client dialog\n- `TaskFormModal.tsx` - Create/edit task dialog\n\n### 6.

Now I have comprehensive information about the application structure. Let me compile my findings:\n\n## Application Structure Report\n\nBased on my exploration of the Sales CRM project, here's what I found:\n\n### 1. Documentation Directory (`/repo/docs`)\n\n**Contents:**\n- `/repo/docs/plan.md` - Contains a polish checklist for responsive UI across all pages\n\n### 2. Tests Documentation (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`)\n\nFound a comprehensive test specification file at `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (49KB) that documents test cases for:\n- **ClientsListPage** tests (sidebar navigation, search/filters, actions, table, pagination)\n- **ClientDetailPage** (planned, structure documented)\n- **PersonDetailPage** (planned, structure documented)\n- **DealsListPage** (planned, structure documented)\n- **DealDetailPage** (comprehensive test specs for deal header, stage progress bar, history, metrics, writeups, linked tasks, attachments, contacts)\n- **TasksListPage** (comprehensive test specs for header, filters, and task list items)\n\n### 3. Apps Directory Structure (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM`)\n\nThe project has a **monorepo structure** with a single primary app:\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/` - Main Sales CRM application\n\n**Key subdirectories:**\n- `/src/pages/` - Page components\n- `/src/components/` - Reusable components\n- `/src/store/` - Redux state management\n- `/docs/` - Documentation (tests.md, bugReports.md, bugs/, mockups/)\n- `/netlify/functions/` - Backend functions\n- `/tests/` - Playwright test specs\n\n### 4.
