Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones.

A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions.

Let me check the testSpec.md directives against the ResetPasswordPage entries in docs/tests.md.\n\nThe ResetPasswordPage section in docs/tests.md (line 1014-1015) is:\n```\n## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n```\n\nIt's completely empty - no components listed, no test entries at all. The ResetPasswordPage component has:\n1. A heading \"Reset Password\"\n2. A password input (\"New password\")\n3. A confirm password input (\"Confirm password\")\n4. An error message display\n\n\n5. A submit button that shows \"Reset Password\" or \"Resetting...\" during submission\n6. Navigation to /clients on successful password reset\n7. Validation for password mismatches\n8. Server and network error handling\n\nAccording to the testSpec.md directives, I need to inventory every visible element and clickable component, specify exact navigation targets and action results, and verify that data mutations are persisted correctly with the right side effects.\n\nThe ResetPasswordPage section is completely missing test entries, which is a major gap. I need to add components listing, test entries for every interactive element including form validation, successful password reset, error handling, and loading states. Let me compare with the ForgotPasswordPage section to match the expected format and structure.\n\nNow I'm checking the backend to see if there's a corresponding reset-password action that also needs testing.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1404,"cache_read_input_tokens":56846,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1404,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"71e501e2-c5c6-42f3-a090-d434e5eca4fc","uuid":"01a745b0-939e-48a1-ba06-8ef6addbc50f"}

Let me analyze the violations:\n\n**Job 1: CheckTestSpecResetPassword**\n\nThe ResetPasswordPage section in docs/tests.md (lines 1014-1015) is completely empty - just a header with no Components listed and no test entries.\n\nLooking at the actual ResetPasswordPage component, it has:\n1. Heading \"Reset Password\"\n2. Password input (placeholder \"New password\")\n3. Confirm password input (placeholder \"Confirm password\")\n4. Submit button \"Reset Password\" / \"Resetting...\"\n5. Error message display\n6. Form validation (passwords don't match)\n\n\n7. Server error handling\n8. Network error handling\n9. Loading state during submission\n10. On success, navigates to /clients\n11. Reads token from URL search params\n\nThere's a critical mismatch between what the frontend sends and what the backend expects. The frontend is sending the password field, but the backend is looking for newPassword instead, which would cause the backend to reject the request with a \"Token and new password required\" error. This is definitely a bug that needs fixing.\n\nBeyond that, there's another issue with the success flow—the backend returns just a success message, not a token or user data, but the frontend is trying to read a token from the response and set it in localStorage for auto-login. This means even if the password reset succeeds, the user won't actually be logged in when they're redirected to /clients.\n\nFor the testSpec.md violations, the ResetPasswordPage section is completely empty with no test entries documented, which violates the directive requirements. .md is empty. This is a major violation of the testSpec.md directives which require:\n- Test entries for every visible element\n- Test entries for every interactive element\n- Test entries for form validation\n- Test entries for navigation targets\n- Test entries for data mutations\n\nThe fix is to add complete test entries for the ResetPasswordPage.\n\nNow let me also think about what violations exist for jobs 2 and 3.\n\n**Job 2: CheckComponentsResetPassword (writeApp.md directives)**\n\nLooking at the writeApp.md directives:\n1. `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements - The component has data-testid attributes on the page, inputs, and submit button. ✅\n2. Consistent padding `p-6 max-sm:p-3` - The root div has the correct padding classes. ✅\n3. Components should be layout-agnostic (no outer padding in component root) - This is a page component, so padding is appropriate ✅\n4. Match test entries in spec - Can't verify since there are no test entries\n5. Frontend sends `password` but backend expects `newPassword` - This is a **bug** in the component code!\n6. Clean, working code - The mismatch between `password` and `newPassword` means the reset won't work\n7. JSX comments for test entries - There are no test entries to reference\n\nSo the main violations for writeApp.md are a critical field name mismatch where the frontend sends `password` but the backend

Let me also check the ConfirmEmailPage section in tests.md for comparison - it's also likely empty.\n\nSo here's my analysis:\n\n**Job 1: CheckTestSpecResetPassword** - The ResetPasswordPage section in docs/tests.md is completely empty. This violates testSpec.md directives:\n- No components listed\n- No test entries for any visible element (heading, inputs, button)\n- No test entries for interactive elements (inputs, submit button)\n- No test entries for form validation (passwords don't match)\n- No test entries for navigation (success → /clients)\n\n\n- No test entries for error handling\n- No test entries for loading state\n\n**Job 2: CheckComponentsResetPassword** - writeApp.md directive violations:\n- Frontend sends `password` field but backend expects `newPassword` - reset password won't work\n- Frontend tries auto-login with `data.token` from response but backend only returns `{ message }` - auto-login won't work  \n- No JSX comments referencing test entries (since there are no test entries)\n\n**Job 3: CheckTestsResetPassword** - writeTests.md directive violations:\n- No test file exists for ResetPasswordPage at all\n\nFor each violation found, I need to add the necessary fixes.\n\nNow I'm organizing these issues into logical groups. The empty test spec entries and missing test file both need test coverage written, the password field mismatch needs a code fix, and the auto-login logic needs to be corrected to match what the backend actually returns. I'll create fix groups that bundle related violations together rather than addressing them individually.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1475,"cache_read_input_tokens":60048,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1475,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"71e501e2-c5c6-42f3-a090-d434e5eca4fc","uuid":"5d04506f-062f-4fb8-8daa-df1125c8cb27"}

This is expected since there are no test entries.\n\nLet me also check if the error display element in ResetPasswordPage has a data-testid:\n\nLooking at line 72: `{error && <p className=\"text-[11px] text-red-500\">{error}</p>}`\n\n\nThe error message is missing the `data-testid` attribute that ForgotPasswordPage includes.

Plus there are no JSX comments next to interactive elements like ForgotPasswordPage has.\n\nFor Job 3, I need to check the writeTests.md violations - and there are no test files for ResetPasswordPage at all.\n\nNow I'm grouping the violations logically: missing test spec entries in tests.md, the code bugs in the component itself, the absence of Playwright tests, and missing JSX comments referencing test entries. I'll organize the fixes to address these systematically - first writing the test entries, then fixing the code bugs, then creating the Playwright tests. groups with FixViolation, RunTests, and optionally DocumentFix jobs. Let me structure them.\n\nFor the testSpec violation, a fix for the empty test spec would be:\n```\n--job \"FixViolationResetPasswordTestSpec: Write complete test entries for ResetPasswordPage in tests.md\"\n```\n\nFor the code bugs:\n```\n--job \"FixViolationResetPasswordCode: Fix password field name mismatch, broken auto-login logic, and missing data-testid in ResetPasswordPage\"\n```\n\nFor the missing tests:\n```\n--job \"FixViolationResetPasswordTests: Write Playwright tests for ResetPasswordPage\"\n--job \"RunTests: Verify tests pass after fix\"\n```\n\nLet me be more specific. I'll group the test spec fix with the code fix since they're related (fixing the test spec first, then the code needs to match it, then tests need to be written).\n\nActually, I should just add fix groups without fixing them myself—the strategy is clear about that. Looking at the root causes, I've got three distinct issues: the test spec is incomplete, the component has code bugs and missing testids, and there are no tests written yet. These should be three separate groups.","signature":"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
