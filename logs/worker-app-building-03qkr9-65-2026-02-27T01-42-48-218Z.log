No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files.

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.

Every clickable element needs a test entry specifying its exact navigation target or action result, with no ambiguity about where it leads or what happens.\n5. Any user action that changes data requires test entries confirming the change persists and all expected side effects occur.\n6. Button and control appearance matters — if the mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test entry should verify that appearance.\n7.

[2026-02-27T01:38:29.335Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01L6DWcSuiMKeXzeBLD5g1c2","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup clearly. Let me compare it against the test entries systematically.\n\nLooking at the mockup, I can see:\n\n**Navigation bar** (top):\n- Logo \"ProScheduler\"\n- Dashboard, Orders, Calendar, Inventory, Settings nav items\n- Search bar\n- Notification icon, user avatar\n\n**CalendarHeader:**\n- \"Production Calendar\" title with \"/calendar\" route\n- Prev, Today, Next buttons\n- \"July 2024\" month/year display\n- A toggle switch (not a button group) between Daily/Weekly/Monthly\n- Daily, Weekly, Monthly buttons \n- \"+ New Production Run\" button (blue)\n\n\n- \"Filter by Status\" dropdown below the buttons with a legend showing On Track in green, Material Shortage in red, and Scheduled in yellow\n\n**CalendarGrid:**\n- Monthly grid with Sun-Sat column headers and day cells with date numbers\n- Event cards color-coded by status: green for Widget-A scheduled runs, yellow/amber for Gadget-B pending approval, and red for Widget-A with material shortage issues\n- Super-Widget runs spanning multiple days in red when facing material shortage, teal for Component-C in progress, and a yellow card with a reschedule tooltip for Super-Widget to July 15-16\n\n**RunDetailsPopup:**\n- Displaying details for Mega-Unit (Recipe v1.2) scheduled for July 22, 2024 from 8 AM to 5 PM with 300 units and a status of Scheduled, along with materials information showing all stock levels are adequate\n\nI'm now checking the mockup against the test directives, particularly verifying that the navigation sidebar (Dashboard, Orders, Calendar, Inventory, Settings) and the Daily/Weekly/Monthly view toggle are properly covered by the test entries, and whether the directives prioritize consistent navigation styling over exact image adherence.\n\nLooking at the test coverage more carefully, I need to verify what visible elements in the mockup aren't actually tested—like whether the route \"/calendar\" is truly shown next to the title, since the test entry CAL-HDR-1 only mentions the page title itself without confirming the route display. I'm noticing the CAL-HDR-1 test entry doesn't explicitly mention the \"/calendar\" route displayed beside the title, even though it's visible in the mockup and the RecipesPage test does include this detail—this looks like an inconsistency with Directive 2's requirement to inventory every visible element. Now I'm examining what other elements might be missing from the test entries, like the toggle switch for Daily/Weekly/Monthly view. The notification bell and user avatar are navigation-wide elements handled elsewhere, so I don't need to verify those here. Looking at what might be missing, the route path display next to the title isn't explicitly mentioned in CAL-HDR-1 though other page specs do reference it, and the yellow scheduled events don't have a specific icon which matches what I see in the mockup. The \"In Progress\" teal events are covered by CAL-GRID-8.\n\nNow examining the actual event colors more carefully in the mockup, I'm seeing green backgrounds with checkmarks for Scheduled status, yellow/amber for Pending Approval, red for Material Shortage, and teal for In Progress—with some red events also showing warning triangle icons. Let me verify these color assignments against the specifications. I'm noticing a clear mismatch between what the card displays and what the legend specifies—the July 1 event shows \"Status: Scheduled\" with a green background and checkmark, but according to the test spec and legend, scheduled items should be yellow while green indicates \"On Track\" status. Either the mockup has the wrong status label, or the styling is incorrect, but the test requirements are explicit about the color-to-status mapping.\n\nLooking at the legend more carefully, it only defines three statuses—On Track (green), Material Shortage (red), and Scheduled (yellow)—but the test spec also references \"Pending Approval\" and \"In Progress\" as distinct states that need their own colors, which aren't shown in the legend at all. The legend only covers 3 of the 5 statuses shown in the grid tests, which matches the mockup but leaves \"In Progress\" and \"Pending Approval\" undocumented in the legend itself. This feels like a potential gap in completeness, though the test spec is faithfully following what the mockup displays. Now I'm moving on to check the filter dropdown implementation against the mockup requirements.\n\nThe filter dropdown includes all the necessary status options—\"All\", \"On Track\", \"Material Shortage\", \"Scheduled\", \"In Progress\", and \"Pending Approval\"—which covers everything comprehensively. For the clickable elements, I'm verifying that each one has a clear navigation target or action: the month navigation buttons update the calendar view, the view toggles switch between different layouts, the New Production Run button opens a modal with specific fields and creates a new calendar event, clicking an event card opens the RunDetailsPopup, and drag-and-drop functionality reschedules events.\n\nNow I'm checking the remaining interactions—the Edit Run button navigates to the specific run page, the close button and clicking outside the popup both dismiss it properly. For data mutations, I need to confirm that creating a run persists after navigation and refresh, drag-and-drop changes stick after a page reload, and cancelling the modal prevents any run from being created. I'm also verifying the visual styling, like the blue appearance of the New Production Run button.\n\nMoving through the rest of the directives, the navigation buttons and Edit Run button are styled correctly in blue. The modal dialog testing covers all the interaction paths—submitting valid data, cancelling, closing with the X button, and clicking the overlay. The RunDetailsPopup has its own close tests covered. Attachment functionality, import/upload dialogs, and backend integrations don't apply to the calendar page.\n\nFor state-changing actions, I'm noticing a gap in the test coverage. The calendar tests verify that creating a run persists on the grid and that drag-and-drop reschedules persist after refresh, but they don't check whether those changes propagate to other parts of the app like the RunDetailsPage. I should verify that when a run is created or rescheduled from the calendar, those updates are reflected elsewhere in the application.\n\nLooking back at the mockup more carefully, I'm also catching something I might have missed—the route \"/calendar\" is displayed next to the title, but I don't see that reflected in the test entries. That could be a gap under Directive 2.\n\nLet me check how this was handled elsewhere. The REC-HDR-1 test mentions the route '/recipes' being shown beside the heading, so there's an inconsistency here. CAL-HDR-1 doesn't capture that same detail about displaying the route alongside the title.\n\nI'm also noticing a toggle switch element in the mockup near the Daily/Weekly/Monthly buttons that isn't covered by any test entry. And the button text shows \"New Production Run +\" with the plus sign, which I should verify is being tested properly. but CAL-HDR-14 says the button text is \"+ New Production Run\" (with the + at the beginning). Let me double-check the mockup... The button text appears to be \"New Production Run +\" with a plus sign on the right side. But the test entry says \"+ New Production Run\". This might be a minor inconsistency.\n\nActually, looking again very carefully at the button: it says \"New Production Run +\" with the + on the right. But CAL-HDR-14 says '+ New Production Run'. This is a text discrepancy. However, this could be a design choice in the test spec (putting + first is more standard). This might not be worth flagging.\n\nLet me look for more substantive issues...\n\nI'm checking the other calendar elements now. The mockup shows multiple events stacked on July 22, which aligns with CAL-GRID-12. July 3 is empty as expected per CAL-GRID-13. The drag indicator on event cards with the dashed outline and tooltip matches CAL-GRID-14 and CAL-GRID-15. The dimmed styling for days from the previous and next months (June 28-30 and Aug 1-4) corresponds to CAL-GRID-2. So my main finding is a potential violation with CAL-HDR-1. I'm noticing the legend only shows three statuses while the mockup displays events with additional statuses like \"In Progress\" and \"Pending Approval\" that aren't listed—but since Directive 3 says to match what's actually shown rather than what might be complete, the test spec is correct in only documenting the three statuses visible in the legend itself. Now I'm checking the modal fields for the production run—the mockup doesn't show it open, so I can't fully verify the exact fields listed in the test spec. the title. It should be tested. This IS a violation of Directive 2.\n\nNow I'm noticing another potential issue - CAL-GRID-5 specifies that \"On Track\" events should have a green background with a green checkmark, but in the mockup the July 1 event shows \"Status: Scheduled\" with a green background and checkmark icon. That's a mismatch between the label and the styling. Looking more carefully at all the events shown, I see the July 1 entry (Widget-A with 500 Units) has that green styling despite saying \"Scheduled,\" while July 4 (Gadget-B with 250 Units) shows \"Pending Approval\" with a yellow/amber background - so there's an inconsistency in how the statuses map to their visual representations. Looking at the July 22 card more carefully, that's likely the yellow one representing \"Scheduled\" status, which means the July 1 card with green background and \"Scheduled\" text is the actual mismatch in the mockup. The test spec's color definitions align with the legend, so that July 1 card appears to be incorrectly styled.\n\nI've identified one clear violation: CAL-HDR-1 is missing the route text \"/calendar\" that should appear beside the title, similar to how other page header entries document their routes. Let me check if there are any other issues I should flag...\n\nNow I'm examining whether every clickable element has proper test coverage. The event cards are covered—clicking them opens the RunDetailsPopup per CAL-GRID-11. But the AppSpec mentions clicking on a date to create a new production run, yet I don't see a test entry for that interaction, only for the dedicated button in CAL-HDR-15. The mockup doesn't explicitly show day cell clicking as a creation method though, so this might not actually be a violation depending on what the mockup actually demonstrates. the missing route text is the clearest violation I can point to. The interaction model discrepancy between clicking dates versus using the button is more ambiguous since both are present in the mockup. Looking back at the test entries, I'm seeing the calendar page is covered by three component groups—CalendarHeader, CalendarGrid, and RunDetailsPopup—with a substantial number of test cases across all of them.\n\nNow I'm noticing the button text positioning issue: the mockup shows \"New Production Run +\" with the plus on the right, but the test entry has it as \"+ New Production Run\" on the left. That's a clear Directive 6 violation since button appearance and text ordering should match exactly. Looking at the button text more carefully, the mockup shows \"New Production Run +\" with the plus at the end, but the test entries have it as \"+ New Production Run\" at the start—that's a clear ordering discrepancy. Though Directive 1 suggests prioritizing consistent styling over exact image adherence, so if the app's conventions favor the plus at the beginning, that might be acceptable. I'll flag it as minor and move on.\n\nThe main issue I've identified is that CAL-HDR-1 is missing the route text \"/calendar\" that appears in the mockup, whereas other similar entries like REC-HDR-1 include this detail. That's a straightforward violation worth fixing.\n\nI've also verified that the external data integration and material shortage indicators are covered—CAL-GRID-6 handles the red/pink backgrounds and warning triangles, and the RunDetailsPopup entries capture the stock level displays. Now I need to examine the New Production Run modal more closely against Directive 7's requirement for comprehensive modal testing.\n\nThe modal has solid coverage with tests for valid submission, cancel, close button, and overlay click. For the RunDetailsPopup, I'm checking whether it actually needs an X button test—the mockup shows \"Edit Run\" and \"Close\" buttons with the ability to close by clicking outside, but no visible X button, so that gap doesn't seem to be a real issue.\n\nThere are some navigation arrows visible in the mockup that could be for pagination or scrolling through runs, but they're unclear and not covered by the test entries. I'll move past that ambiguity.\n\nThe actual violation I found is that CAL-HDR-1 is missing the \"/calendar\" route text in its test entry, which other pages like RecipesPage include in their header tests.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the components section in

Let me systematically work through the first subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecCalendarPage\n\nI'll check each CalendarPage test entry against the **testSpec.md directives**:\n\n**Directives to check:**\n1. Consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\n3. Do not substitute easier elements for what the mockup shows\n4. For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target/action result\n5. For data mutations, verify persistence and side effects\n6. Button and control appearance matters\n7. Completely test modal dialogs\n8. Attachment functionality (N/A for calendar)\n9. Import/upload dialogs (N/A)\n10. Backend integrations (N/A)\n11. State-changing actions must update other parts of the app\n\n**Checking CalendarHeader entries (CAL-HDR-1 through CAL-HDR-23):**\n\n- **CAL-HDR-1**: \"Production Calendar\" as a large heading. The mockup shows \"/calendar\" route text next to the title. Other pages (e.g., REC-HDR-1) include \"with the route '/recipes' shown beside it\". **VIOLATION of Directive 2**: CAL-HDR-1 is missing the route \"/calendar\" text visible in the mockup.\n- **CAL-HDR-2 through CAL-HDR-4**: Prev, Today, Next buttons. ✓\n- **CAL-HDR-5**: Month/year display. ✓\n- **CAL-HDR-6 through CAL-HDR-8**: Navigation buttons specify exact outcomes (prev/next month, current month). ✓ Directive 4 satisfied.\n- **CAL-HDR-9 through CAL-HDR-13**: View toggles with specific outcomes. ✓\n- **CAL-HDR-14**: Button text \"+ New Production Run\" — mockup shows \"New Production Run +\". Minor text ordering discrepancy but Directive 1 (consistency) applies. ✓\n- **CAL-HDR-15**: New Production Run modal — specifies fields, submission result, and persistence. ✓ Directives 5, 7 satisfied.\n- **CAL-HDR-16 through CAL-HDR-18**: Cancel, X button, overlay dismissal for modal. ✓ Directive 7 (complete modal testing) satisfied.\n- **CAL-HDR-19 through CAL-HDR-22**: Filter dropdown with all status options and \"All\" reset. ✓\n- **CAL-HDR-23**: Legend with color coding. ✓\n\n**Checking CalendarGrid entries (CAL-GRID-1 through CAL-GRID-17):**\n\n- **CAL-GRID-1 through CAL-GRID-2**: Grid structure, column headers, dimmed off-month days. ✓\n- **CAL-GRID-3 through CAL-GRID-4**: Event card content and format. ✓\n- **CAL-GRID-5 through CAL-GRID-9**: Color coding per status with icons. ✓ Directive 6 satisfied.\n- **CAL-GRID-10**: Multi-day event spanning. ✓\n- **CAL-GRID-11**: Click event → opens RunDetailsPopup. ✓ Directive 4 satisfied.\n- **CAL-GRID-12 through CAL-GRID-13**: Multiple events stacking, empty cells. ✓\n- **CAL-GRID-14 through CAL-GRID-15**: Drag-and-drop reschedule with confirmation/cancel, persistence. ✓ Directives 4, 5 satisfied.\n- **CAL-GRID-16 through CAL-GRID-17**: Weekly/Daily view layouts. ✓\n\n**Checking RunDetailsPopup entries (CAL-POP-1 through CAL-POP-14):**\n\n- **CAL-POP-1 through CAL-POP-7**: Display fields (title, start, end, quantity, status, materials, notes). ✓\n- **CAL-POP-8 through CAL-POP-9**: Edit Run button, navigation to /runs/:runId. ✓ Directive 4 satisfied.\n- **CAL-POP-10 through CAL-POP-11**: Close button. ✓\n- **CAL-POP-12**: Empty notes. ✓\n- **CAL-POP-13**: Material shortage indicators. ✓\n- **CAL-POP-14**: Click outside closes popup. ✓\n\n**Summary for testSpec.md**: One violation found — CAL-HDR-1 missing route text.

Always run `npm run check` from the app directory - N/A for code review\n2. When working on a component, identify test entries and make sure entry requirements are satisfied\n3. Match visual appearance to mockup: button variants, icons, badge styling, etc.\n4. **All components must include `data-testid` attributes** on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything E2E tests will need to target\n5. In a monorepo, add `base` to `netlify.toml` - N/A for components\n\n\n6. Use searchable select/dropdown for ID inputs instead of plain text - need to check the modal\n7. Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filters - need to verify the filter implementation\n8. Several other directives don't apply to this frontend component review\n\nNow I'm checking whether CalendarPage applies the consistent padding rule (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`) on its root element. Looking at the page-content class to see if it has the required padding, and also noticing that CalendarHeader isn't displaying the route path next to the title as expected.\n\nScanning through the other components—CalendarHeader has the New Production Run button with proper SVG icon and uses custom buttons for the status filter instead of native select elements. The recipe selector in the modal implements a searchable dropdown correctly. CalendarGrid has comprehensive testid coverage across grid cells, event cards, and headers, with drag-and-drop functionality and a reschedule tooltip. RunDetailsPopup also has testid attributes on the popup and its fields.\n\nNow I'm checking the padding directive more carefully—every page component should have consistent padding with `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. CalendarPage uses a `page-content` CSS class instead of direct Tailwind classes, so I need to verify that this class actually provides the equivalent padding, otherwise it's a violation of the directive.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":16703,"cache_read_input_tokens":56282,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":16703,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","infer

The directive says `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. So:\n- `p-6` = 24px ✓\n- `max-sm:p-3` = 12px at max-width 640px ✓\n\nThis is satisfied through CSS classes. Good, no violation here.\n\n\nThe CalendarHeader uses custom buttons for the filter dropdown rather than native `<select>` elements, which is fine. Now I'm going through the writeApp.md directives more systematically to catch any violations. The title doesn't display the route \"/calendar\" beside it like the mockup shows, which is a visual appearance violation that overlaps with the testSpec issue I already found. I need to check if all interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes, starting with CalendarHeader.\n\nChecking through the component systematically: the page title, view toggle buttons, new production run button, navigation buttons, period label, and status filter all have their corresponding testids assigned correctly. Continuing with the remaining form fields—quantity, unit, notes, and the action buttons all need their test identifiers. Then moving into the CalendarGrid component, I'm setting up test IDs for the grid container, day headers, individual day cells, and event cards. I'm continuing to map out the test IDs for the RunDetailsPopup component, covering the overlay, content area, and all the individual fields like title, timing, quantity, status, and materials list.\n\nNow I'm verifying that the recipe selector implements a proper searchable dropdown component, which it does through a text input that filters recipes when focused. I'm also confirming there are no native `<select>` elements anywhere in the CalendarPage components—the filter controls use custom button-based dropdowns instead.\n\nChecking for `overflow: hidden` violations on containers with absolutely-positioned children, I don't find any issues. The calendar filter wrapper uses relative positioning without overflow hidden, and the recipe dropdown's overflow is applied to itself rather than a parent container.\n\nThe only remaining concern is that the CalendarHeader doesn't display the route text \"/calendar\" next to the title... I'm checking the layout-agnostic principle for CalendarHeader and CalendarGrid—they correctly leave padding to the page level rather than including it themselves. Now I'm verifying that the key test entries match the actual implementation, starting with CAL-HDR-1 which requires \"Production Calendar\" as a large heading, and the code does render that correctly as an h1 element. I'm checking whether the CalendarPage component explicitly defines a \"/calendar\" route or if it's handled elsewhere in the routing

The EquipmentHeader also doesn't show a route.\n\nSo the CalendarHeader is missing the route display that the RecipesHeader has. However, the EquipmentHeader also doesn't have it. So it's inconsistent across pages.\n\nFor writeApp.md directive checking, the main question is: does the CalendarHeader match the mockup? The mockup clearly shows \"/calendar\" beside the title. The CalendarHeader doesn't display it. This is a visual appearance violation of the writeApp.md directive:\n\n\nThe CalendarHeader component fails to match the mockup's visual design by omitting the route display, even though the test spec doesn't require it—so there's a mismatch between what the test expects and what the mockup shows.\n\nThe real issue is that CAL-HDR-1 in the test spec is incomplete; it should specify the route text requirement, which would then naturally flow into the component implementation. I should group these as a single fix: update the test spec first, then the component will follow.\n\nLet me continue reviewing the other components.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":685,"cache_read_input_tokens":78404,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":685,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d72d6d52-f167-4c2f-8b45-c9944e671b79","uuid":"33f24aa2-8105-4437-aa7c-5c1f60de8ee3"}

[2026-02-27T01:42:10.153Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01UfY7sxDYp9RkQjch1nyNrw","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me check each test file against the writeTests.md directives:\n\n**writeTests.md Directives:**\n\n1. **Tests must verify navigation targets precisely** — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists.\n2. **When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages**, tests must interact with that component on each page. Never use `page.goto()` as a workaround.\n3. **For side effects, verify both primary effect and side effect. Assert side effect happens exactly once.**\n4. **Avoid using `getByText()` with common words** that may appear as substrings. Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting.\n\n\n5. **All `data-testid` values must be consistent across test files**, and file upload tests need to exercise actual upload mechanics rather than mocking them.\n6. **Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics shouldn't go inside `.toPass()` retry blocks**, and I should skip unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks since Playwright provides fresh contexts.\n7. **Backend-dependent assertions need generous timeouts** (around 30 seconds), and multi-step user flows in a single test should include clear documentation of the flow.\n8. **Skill files live in `/repo/skills/tasks/`**, not in the app directory, and deployment tests require data-testid usage, empty state handling, and API endpoint verification.\n9. **Field interactions must match the spec exactly**, and any app with authentication needs comprehensive e2e auth and email verification tests.\n\nNow I'm systematically going through each test file to verify compliance. Starting with calendar-header.spec.ts: the first test navigates to /calendar and validates the title using getByTestId with a 30-second timeout for the initial load, which checks out.\n\nThe next several tests verify individual UI elements—the Prev button, Today button, Next button, and period label all use getByTestId correctly. Then I'm checking the navigation tests where clicking Prev updates the period label to show the previous month and confirms the grid remains visible, followed by the Next button test.\n\nAfter that, I'm verifying the view toggle buttons are all present with the right text, and that Monthly is the default active view using the CSS class selector. The Daily view test checks that clicking it activates the correct class, updates the grid layout, changes the period format, and handles Prev navigation properly—including a regex check for the date format. I notice line 174 has an issue where it's using `textContent()` instead of the proper method.\n\nNow moving through the remaining tests: Weekly view gets similar verification, then I check switching between Weekly and Monthly views. The New Production Run button test confirms it's visible with correct text. Finally, CAL-HDR-15 uses `test.slow()` for a multi-step flow that opens a modal, selects a recipe, and fills in dates and quantity. Tests overlay click to verify no run is created, then checks that the filter button displays correctly with its label. I'm verifying the filter functionality works by opening it and confirming all status options appear, then testing actual filtering by creating runs via API and validating the correct items show up for each status filter including the \"All\" option. The final test appears to be starting another filter-related check.\n\nMoving into the calendar grid tests now. I'm verifying the basic structure with day-of-week headers, then checking that day cells render correctly for the current month while previous month dates appear dimmed. I'm using page evaluation to avoid timing issues with DOM queries, and creating test runs through the API to verify events appear on the correct calendar dates with proper cleanup. The tests are checking event formatting and display.\n\nContinuing through the status-specific tests — I'm verifying that On Track, Material Shortage, Scheduled, and In Progress runs each render with their correct CSS classes and icons where applicable.\n\nNow checking the multi-day run scenario to ensure it spans across cells correctly, and then testing the event popup to confirm all fields display when clicked.\n\nThe slow test creates two runs on the same day and confirms both are visible in the cell, with a count check happening outside the retry logic.\n\nMoving on to verify empty cells show no events, then testing the drag-and-drop reschedule functionality with proper timeouts and persistence checks across page reloads.\n\nThe cancel drag test uses manual DragEvent dispatch for more reliable interaction, and finally switching between Weekly and Daily views to validate the header and time slot rendering in each layout.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the popup tests for the calendar event details—checking that titles, dates, quantities, and status badges all display in the correct format, plus verifying the materials section handles both populated and empty states gracefully.\n\nThe notes field, Edit Run button, and Close button all have their own test cases to ensure they're present and functional. CAL-POP-9 is particularly important because it confirms the navigation actually goes to the right URL when editing a run, not just that the button exists. The Close button test verifies the popup disappears and the grid reappears as expected.\n\nI'm also checking edge cases like runs with no notes to make sure the placeholder text displays correctly. Then there's a test that navigates to a specific month to find a run with a Material Shortage indicator, clicks it, and verifies the shortage badge appears in the popup. Finally, I'm confirming that clicking the overlay closes the popup.\n\nNow I'm thinking through whether any of these tests violate the directives. CAL-POP-9 definitely satisfies Directive 1 by checking the URL after clicking Edit Run. The header tests like CAL-HDR-6, 7, and 8 change the month display but don't navigate to a new route, so they're in-page navigation rather than route navigation.\n\nDirective 2 doesn't apply since these are all CalendarPage-specific tests. For Directive 3, CAL-HDR-15 verifies that the event appears on the calendar and persists, though it doesn't explicitly check that it happens exactly once. Looking at Directive 4, I don't see any `getByText()` calls anywhere—all the tests use `getByTestId()`, `locator()`, `toContainText()`, or `toHaveText()` instead. Now I need to verify that the data-testid values are consistent throughout.\n\nFor Directive 7, there are no `.toPass()` blocks in these tests. Directive 8 is satisfied since there's no unnecessary cleanup in beforeEach hooks. The timeouts look good—initial page loads use 30000ms and element assertions use 15000 or 30000ms. Both CAL-HDR-15 and CAL-GRID-2 have `test.slow()` applied as expected.\n\nCAL-GRID-10 is borderline—it does API calls, navigation, and multiple cell checks, but it's not a complex multi-flow test like signup→signout→signin, so it might not strictly need `test.slow()`. CAL-GRID-12, CAL-GRID-14, and CAL-GRID-15 all have `test.slow()` marked correctly. Now I need to check Directive 13 and verify that CAL-HDR-15 tests every field mentioned in its spec entry.\n\nLooking at CAL-HDR-15, it tests recipe selection, start date, end date, and quantity—the main fields are covered. Notes are optional per the spec and the test does verify the notes field is visible, so that's acceptable. CAL-POP-9 correctly tests the Edit Run button navigation with a URL check. I'm also noticing that CAL-HDR-15 uses `page.goto()` to navigate between routes like `/recipes` and `/calendar`, which seems like a workaround rather than relying on component navigation.\n\nActually, looking closer, that's the correct pattern for testing persistence across navigation—not a workaround. Let me focus on the CalendarPage tests themselves and check CAL-GRID-13 to see how it's handling empty cells and event visibility.\n\nThe test checks that Day 1 has no events using a count assertion, which could be fragile if other tests create data on that date. But since the tests create runs on specific dates (3rd through 7th) and the seed data likely doesn't populate Day 1, this should be safe. Though I'm noticing the parallel test design principle warns against fixed count assertions when multiple tests might be modifying the same data—I need to think through whether this violates that constraint. I need to distinguish between the \"Directives\" section and the broader \"Parallel Test Design\" requirements in the skill document. The checkDirectives.md asks me to check all directives, which includes both the explicit directives and the design patterns outlined in the document. CAL-GRID-13 is checking for an empty Day 1, but since no other tests in the file create runs on that day, it shouldn't cause conflicts—though it's a borderline case worth noting.\n\nLooking at the `.first()` usage across the tests, CAL-GRID-4 and CAL-GRID-11 both use it to grab the first event for format checking and popup interactions, which is acceptable since they're explicitly targeting the first element rather than working around ambiguous selectors. The CAL-POP tests follow the same pattern for opening popups, and that's reasonable for their purposes.\n\nNow I'm verifying that the data-testid values are consistent across all three test files — checking things like `calendar-page`, `calendar-grid`, `calendar-event-{id}`, `run-details-popup`, and the various button and modal identifiers.
