Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise.

There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    53→\n    54→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    69→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    70→\n    71→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    72→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4b9a37e7-94a5-4e6b-aa12-bc4fbe88abb7","uuid":"eca16097-df75-4424-9a47-a36cda046b0c","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01Xsy2P8CWrfu9hKhyC6UQN6","session_id":"4b9a37e7-94a5-4e6b-aa12-bc4fbe88abb7","uuid":"5d8d2d2d-4071-4451-ac18-773c7ee6257e"}

[2026-02-25T10:31:25.634Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_013XEy4fAPTRDJyShNpaJL2V","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Looking at the existing code, all four components (QuickActions, UpcomingOrdersTable, SuppliersList, and DashboardPage) already exist and appear to be fairly complete. Let me review them against the test spec to check if anything needs improvement or if they're already meeting all requirements.\n\nLet me check each component against the tests.md:\n\n### QuickActions\nLooking at tests:\n1. ✅ \"Display Add New Supplier Button\" - present with person-plus icon\n2. ✅ \"Display Create Purchase Order Button\" - present with document icon\n3. ✅ \"Add New Supplier Button Opens Create Supplier Dialog\" - modal opens with all fields\n\n\n4. ✅ \"Create Supplier via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" - saves and refreshes\n5. ✅ \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\" - cancel closes without saving\n6. ✅ \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" - validates supplier name required\n7. ✅ \"Create Purchase Order Button Opens Create Order Dialog\" - modal with all fields\n8. ✅ \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" - saves and refreshes\n9. ✅ \"Create Order Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Order\" - cancel closes\n10. ✅ \"Create Order Dialog Validation\" - validates supplier required\n\nThe QuickActions component has solid test coverage with all necessary test IDs in place. Moving to UpcomingOrdersTable, I'm seeing tests for the heading, table structure with Order ID, Supplier, Expected Delivery, Status, and Total Cost columns, data rendering, clickable order ID links that navigate to detail pages, proper styling for those links, and status badge coloring with a filter dropdown for status filtering.\n\nThere's also a supplier filter dropdown that works alongside the status filter, handling empty states when no orders match the filters or when there are no upcoming orders at all. The component properly formats currency in the Total Cost column and dates in the Expected Delivery column.\n\nI'm noticing something about the navigation though—the route uses `order.order_id` which maps to the PO number format like \"PO-2023-001\", and that matches what the spec expects for the `/orders/:orderId` route, so that's correct.\n\nNow I'm checking the SuppliersList component against its test cases—it needs a heading, a 4-column grid layout for the supplier cards, and bold supplier names.\n\nEach card should display a status badge in the top-right corner, the contact name below the supplier name, contact email below that, and an orders summary showing open orders and their total value. Clicking a card should navigate to the supplier details page, and there's an empty state message when no suppliers exist.\n\nFor the DashboardPage, I'm starting to verify its implementation against the spec. Everything looks to be complete already. The components are fully implemented with all the required data-testids, functionality, and styling. The DashboardPage correctly integrates all three components.\n\nHowever, I should also check if the `total_cost` field exists on the Order type and verify the navigation routing. Looking at the UpcomingOrdersTable, it navigates using `order.order_id` which is the human-readable PO number like PO-2023-001, and the route parameter `:orderId` receives this PO number, which matches the test spec. The backend would need to handle lookups by either UUID or PO number, but that's outside the scope of this task. Continuing through the rest of the test attributes to ensure complete coverage of the form fields and modal interactions. Continuing with the UpcomingOrdersTable test IDs for the supplier filter, table structure, individual order rows with their status indicators, and empty states for both unfiltered and filtered views. Then moving into the SuppliersList component to add test IDs for the main container, heading, grid layout, and individual supplier cards.\n\nI've now finished adding all the test IDs across both components and the dashboard page itself. Let me double-check that everything compiles correctly before moving forward.\n\nActually, I should re-examine what the task is really asking for. The subtasks mention writing four specific components, but they're already fully implemented in the codebase. This might mean the previous iteration already completed this work, or the setup created them automatically. Since the skill emphasizes writing clean, working code, I should verify everything passes type checking and linting.\n\nI also want to make sure the `total_cost` calculation is correct in the Order
