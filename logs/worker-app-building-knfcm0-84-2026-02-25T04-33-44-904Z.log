SALES CRM APP\n\n**Spec** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md`): CRM for tracking clients, individuals/contacts, deals (with pipeline stages), tasks, and attachments. Rich data model with relationships, contact history, and deal writeups.\n\n**Pages in routes (9 currently routed, but spec calls for more):**\n| Page | Route | Implemented? |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| ClientsListPage | `/clients` (default) | Yes (file exists) |\n| ClientDetailPage | `/clients/:clientId` | NO -- not in routes, no file |\n| PersonDetailPage | `/individuals/:individualId` | NO -- not in routes, no file |\n| DealsListPage | `/deals` | Yes (file exists) |\n| DealDetailPage | `/deals/:dealId` | NO -- not in routes, no file |\n| TasksListPage | `/tasks` | Yes (file exists) |\n| TaskDetailPage | `/tasks/:taskId` | NO -- not in routes, no file |\n| ContactsListPage | `/contacts` | Yes (file exists) |\n| UsersListPage | `/users` | Yes (file exists) |\n| UserDetailPage | `/users/:userId` | NO -- not in routes, no file |\n| SettingsPage | `/settings` | Yes (file exists) |\n| ForgotPasswordPage | `/auth/forgot-password` | Yes |\n| ResetPasswordPage | `/auth/reset-password` | Yes |\n| ConfirmEmailPage | `/auth/confirm-email` | Yes |\n\n**Components:**\n- `NavigationSidebar.tsx` -- sidebar with auth integration (uses `useAuth` from shared)\n\n**Redux Slices:** NONE app-specific -- only shared `authReducer`\n\n**Types:** No types/index.ts file exists yet.\n\n**Backend:** 1 netlify function: `auth.ts` (uses `@shared/backend/db`)\n\n**Imports from shared:**\n- `@shared/store/store` -- `createAppStore`\n- `@shared/auth/authSlice` -- `authReducer`\n- `@shared/styles/tokens.css`, `layout.css`\n- `@shared/auth/useAuth` -- used in NavigationSidebar\n- `@shared/backend/db` -- used in `netlify/functions/auth.ts`\n\n**Tests** (`/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md`): Only the Sidebar section has full test specs (SidebarNavigation and SidebarAuth with auth flows).

The `doubleEntry.ts` utility is also unused despite both Accounting and InventoryTracker having double-entry transaction systems.\n\n2. **Apps duplicate patterns instead of using shared**: All four apps manually define `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` in their own `hooks.ts` instead of using the shared `createTypedHooks` factory. ProductionHub and SalesCRM build their own sidebar components instead of using the shared `AppLayout`/`Sidebar`.\n\n3. **SalesCRM is the least complete**: It only has list page stubs, auth integration, and no domain-specific Redux slices or type definitions. It is missing ClientDetailPage, PersonDetailPage, DealDetailPage, TaskDetailPage, and UserDetailPage entirely.\n\n4. **ProductionHub is the most complete**: All 6 pages are implemented with 24 components, full test specs for every page, and 4 backend functions.\n\n5. **Backend `auth-middleware` and `db.ts`** are available but only SalesCRM's auth function uses `db.ts`. None of the apps use `auth-middleware`. The Accounting and InventoryTracker backend functions presumably import the db module directly rather than through the shared alias (or use their own inline approach)."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a610ddffa9c85cbb4 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 108778\ntool_uses: 77\nduration_ms: 131052</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6fd46deb-26c3-477b-b65b-810547e0388d","uuid":"b2c13b3f-00a5-42a2-a010-f8bf4f8d966f","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the existing apps, their specs, and the shared code that already exists in the repository.\n\nPlease do the following:\n\n1.

The Accounting and InventoryTracker backend functions presumably import the db module directly rather than through the shared alias (or use their own inline approach)."}],"totalDurationMs":131052,"totalTokens":108778,"totalToolUseCount":77,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":434,"cache_read_input_tokens":103775,"output_tokens":4568,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":434},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me analyze what shared code the SupplierTracker app needs.\n\nLooking at the SupplierTracker spec and test spec:\n\n**Pages:**\n1. DashboardPage (/) - QuickActions, UpcomingOrdersTable, SuppliersList\n2. SupplierDetailsPage (/suppliers/:supplierId) - SupplierOverview, DocumentsTab, CommentsSection, OrdersSection\n3. OrderDetailsPage (/orders/:orderId) - OrderSummary, LineItemsTable, CostBreakdown, OrderDocuments, OrderHistory\n\n\n4. I can see that SupplierTracker can reuse the store setup, auth system, and base styles from shared, plus the breadcrumb and comments components that ProductionHub already provides. I'll also need to check if ConfirmDialog is available for delete operations.\n\n5. Looking at what might need to be added to shared, the documents section stands out—both detail pages have upload/view/download functionality, but I don't see this pattern in ProductionHub or Accounting yet, so I should verify if SalesCRM uses it before deciding whether to extract it as a shared component.\n\n6. Status badges with color coding are already handled by the existing badge styles in common.css, so those are covered.\n\n7. The UpcomingOrdersTable with its filtering pattern seems fairly specific to SupplierTracker's needs right now.\n\n8. I should follow the task instructions and check if there are other apps that could benefit from shared code, then use add-task to break down what needs to be extracted.\n\nLooking at the skill guidance more carefully: I need to identify what code can actually be shared between SupplierTracker and the other apps in the directory, rather than just assuming everything should be shared. The real question is whether components like the order table, document management, or status badges would be useful across multiple apps or if they're truly SupplierTracker-specific. available:\n- Store, auth, styles, breadcrumb, comments, confirm dialog, pagination, filter select, searchable select, currency/date utils, db\n\nThese are already built in shared/. SupplierTracker can just USE them. The task is about writing NEW shared code or refactoring existing code INTO shared.\n\nLooking at the SupplierTracker features that might overlap with other apps:\n\n1. **Document management with file upload** - SupplierTracker has documents on both SupplierDetailsPage and OrderDetailsPage. Does any other app need this?\n   - SalesCRM mentions \"attachments\" in the spec for deals\n   - This could be a shared DocumentsSection component\n\n2. **Status badges** - Already in common.css. All apps use status badges.\n\n3. **Navigation bar** - SupplierTracker has a top nav bar while Accounting and InventoryTracker have their own header components, but ProductionHub and SalesCRM use sidebar navigation. The shared layout already provides sidebar layout, though the test spec calls for a top navigation bar with the app logo, links to Dashboard/Suppliers/Orders/Inventory, and a user profile dropdown.\n\n4. **Tables with search and filter** - Very common pattern across apps like UpcomingOrdersTable and SuppliersList.\n\nLet me refocus on what SupplierTracker specifically needs versus what's already available in other apps. I'm identifying the main candidates for shared code—a reusable document management component that both SupplierTracker and SalesCRM could use for handling uploads, viewing, and downloads. But I need to be more rigorous about this: shared code should have nearly identical requirements across apps, and I should check if implementations already exist elsewhere before extracting them. Let me review what SalesCRM actually specifies about attachments on deals to see if the requirements truly align. Most of what SupplierTracker needs already exists in the shared utilities—components like CommentsSection, Breadcrumb, ConfirmDialog, and helpers like formatCurrency and formatDate are all available. The real opportunities for new shared code are a StatusBadge component for the color-coded status indicators used across multiple apps, and a DocumentsSection component to handle the upload, view, and download patterns that both SupplierTracker and SalesCRM will need.\n\nLooking at the skill description more carefully, I should structure this as subtasks: one for app-wide logic like the store and auth (which are already shared), and then separate subtasks for each page's components. For SupplierTracker's dashboard, the QuickActions, UpcomingOrdersTable, and SuppliersList components are pretty specific to this app, so there's not much to extract as shared code there.\n\nOn the details pages, I'm noticing a pattern with documents—SupplierDetailsPage has a DocumentsTab and OrderDetailsPage has a DocumentsSection. The question is whether these are similar enough to SalesCRM's attachments feature to justify sharing. SalesCRM's spec mentions attachments but doesn't go into detail about the UI or behavior, so they might be different enough that sharing wouldn't make sense right now. I'm noticing StatusBadge is a genuinely shared pattern across multiple apps—SupplierTracker, InventoryTracker, ProductionHub, and SalesCRM all use colored status indicators for different entities. Let me dig into whether there's already badge styling in the common CSS that I can build on, or if I need to create a unified component.\n\nActually, stepping back, most of what SupplierTracker needs already exists in the shared codebase. The one real opportunity I see is a DocumentsSection component for handling uploads, viewing, downloading, and searching documents—something that could work for both SupplierTracker and potentially SalesCRM down the line. But that might be premature unless SalesCRM actually needs it soon.\n\nLet me reconsider the core principle here: shared code should solve identical or nearly identical problems across multiple apps. Looking at what SupplierTracker requires, I'm finding that CommentsSection, Breadcrumb, ConfirmDialog, Pagination, and FilterSelect are all already available in shared from other apps like ProductionHub. So the question becomes whether there's anything genuinely new that warrants extraction into shared code.\n\nThe DocumentsSection component is the only real candidate since SupplierTracker needs it in multiple places—both on the SupplierDetailsPage and OrderDetailsPage. But when I check SalesCRM's spec, it mentions attachments in the data model without clear, detailed requirements yet. Since the matching requirements aren't well-defined across apps, I should probably just build DocumentsSection as a shared component for SupplierTracker's own reuse rather than waiting for perfect alignment with other apps. Looking at the actual component overlaps between SupplierTracker and the other apps, DocumentsSection and OrderHistory are unique to SupplierTracker, while StatusBadge is already handled through CSS. I should focus on whether SupplierTracker's components would genuinely benefit other apps rather than forcing shared code where there's no real duplication.\n\nChecking the SalesCRM requirements more carefully—it needs clients, contacts, deals with pipeline stages, tasks, and attachments. The overlap with SupplierTracker is mostly generic patterns like detail pages, list views, and CRUD operations, which are too high-level to justify extracting shared components right now.\n\nSupplierTracker uses UploadThing for file uploads in both the documents tab and order documents, so a reusable DocumentsSection component with upload, view, download, and search capabilities would be genuinely useful across both apps. StatusBadge is less critical since the styling is already handled by common CSS. I think DocumentsSection is the main candidate worth extracting as a shared component. Looking at the scope here, I realize there's really only one or two components worth extracting as shared code—DocumentsSection being the main candidate. Rather than breaking this into a bunch of subtasks, I should probably just implement these directly since the shared logic is pretty contained. Let me check what actually needs to be built across the different pages to see if unpacking makes sense or if I should move straight into writing the code. I need to check whether SupplierTracker actually shares components with other apps before unpacking this into subtasks. Looking at the app-wide logic, the store and auth are already shared, so I'm really looking for page-level components that have identical or near-identical requirements across multiple apps.\n\nThe DashboardPage has QuickActions, UpcomingOrdersTable, and SuppliersList which all seem specific to SupplierTracker. For SupplierDetailsPage, CommentsSection is already shared, and DocumentsTab might be reusable with SalesCRM, but OrdersSection appears to be cut off—I need to see the full list before deciding what's actually worth extracting.\n\nLooking at OrderDetailsPage, I'm noticing that OrderHistory as a timeline pattern could work across multiple apps—SalesCRM would need deal activity logs, ProductionHub would track run status changes, and InventoryTracker could use transaction history. But none of these implementations exist yet, so I can't confirm if they're truly compatible or just conceptually similar.\n\nFor my final assessment, DocumentsSection is the only genuine shared component worth extracting—it handles display, search, upload, and download functionality that both SupplierTracker and SalesCRM need. Everything else is either already shared or too specific to individual apps. Given that most pages don't have meaningful shared code to extract, I'm questioning whether I should create subtasks for every page as the skill template suggests, or only for pages where there's actual shared code to implement.\n\nWait, I'm reconsidering the Timeline/ActivityLog pattern—SupplierTracker's OrderHistory, SalesCRM's deal activity log, and ProductionHub's run status history all follow the same structure with timestamps, descriptions, and event-type icons. That's another solid candidate for a shared component. So I have two real opportunities: DocumentsSection and Timeline/ActivityLog. Since the task is asking me to unpack and create subtasks for SupplierTracker's shared code, I should focus on what actually needs to be extracted rather than forcing subtasks where there's nothing to share. I'm realizing the skill template is pretty strict about structure, so I should probably just follow it even if the app-wide logic subtask feels thin. Let me map out the actual subtasks: one for the DocumentsSection component that spans both pages, then individual subtasks for how it integrates into SupplierDetailsPage and OrderDetailsPage respectively. shouldn't create the subtask.\n\n2. One subtask for each page's shared components:\n   - DashboardPage: No new shared components needed → skip\n   - SupplierDetailsPage: DocumentsSection → create subtask\n   - OrderDetailsPage: DocumentsSection (same component) + possibly Timeline → but DocumentsSection is already covered\n\nI think the cleanest approach is to create subtasks only where there's actual shared code to write. The DocumentsSection component stands out as the main candidate since it's needed for both SupplierDetailsPage and OrderDetailsPage. Timeline is more speculative at this point since only SupplierTracker clearly needs it.\n\nLet me check the SalesCRM spec more carefully. From what was reported, it's a CRM for tracking clients, contacts, deals with pipeline stages, tasks, and attachments—and the detail pages like ClientDetailPage and DealDetailPage don't exist yet. Since SalesCRM's test specs are mostly unwritten except for the Sidebar, I can't compare specifics across the apps. I've been overthinking this—let me just commit to DocumentsSection as the shared component worth extracting. I'm realizing the \"Unpack\" instruction means I should be creating subtasks via add-task rather than writing code directly, since other workers will pick those up. The skill guidance is clear that I shouldn't start working on tasks I create, so I need to add the DocumentsSection component as a subtask and signal DONE. I'm realizing the DocumentsSection component needs to handle two pretty different UI patterns—a card layout for one page and a list layout for another—so I'd need to make it flexible enough to support both while keeping the shared logic intact.\n\nSince the skill explicitly tells me to use `add-task` when there are other apps involved, I should follow that guidance and create subtasks rather than trying to do everything in one go, even though the component itself is relatively small. I'm realizing the \"Unpack:\" prefix means I should analyze whether subtasks are needed and create them if there's meaningful work. Most of the shared code for SupplierTracker already exists, but DocumentsSection is a valid candidate for a subtask since it could be reused across multiple pages. I'll create a subtask for that rather than writing it directly, since the skill emphasizes using add-task for unpacking.\n\nThe real question is whether DocumentsSection should be shared code at all—SupplierTracker has clear document management needs, but SalesCRM only mentions \"attachments\" without detailed specs, so the requirements might diverge. I need to check SalesCRM's actual component requirements for the deal detail page to make a proper decision, but the exploration report only has sidebar tests detailed while other pages are marked as

[2026-02-25T04:33:27.565Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01NhpjUven9McTpEHWFwa8SX","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear picture. Let me see what SalesCRM has that overlaps with SupplierTracker:\n\n1. **Attachments/Documents**: \n   - SalesCRM ClientDetailPage has `AttachmentsSection` and `AddAttachmentModal`\n   - SalesCRM DealDetailPage has `DealAttachmentsSection`\n   - SupplierTracker SupplierDetailsPage has `DocumentsTab`\n   - SupplierTracker OrderDetailsPage has `OrderDocuments`\n   - This is a strong match for shared code!\n\n2. **Timeline/Activity Log**:\n   - SalesCRM has timeline components on ClientDetailPage and a recent activity feed on UserDetailPage\n   - SupplierTracker has an order history timeline on OrderDetailsPage\n   - This is another solid candidate for extraction!\n\n3. **Comments**:\n   - Already shared (CommentsSection)\n   - SupplierTracker uses it, ProductionHub uses it\n\nSo I'm seeing two strong candidates for new shared components: a documents/attachments section that appears across multiple detail pages in both systems, and a timeline/activity log pattern that could be standardized.\n\nNow I need to think through the subtask structure. Looking at the skill requirements, I should have one subtask for app-wide logic and then one per page for shared components. For SupplierTracker specifically, I'm seeing DocumentsSection used on both the supplier and order detail pages, and a timeline component on the order page that mirrors what SalesCRM is doing.\n\nComparing the actual implementations more closely, SupplierTracker's DocumentsTab has document cards showing file name, type, and upload date with action icons, search functionality by name, upload capability with a type field, and view/download actions. SalesCRM's attachments section appears to have similar functionality.\n\nLooking at the timeline components, SupplierTracker's OrderHistory shows a reverse chronological vertical timeline with timestamps, descriptions, and icons keyed to event types like status changes, document uploads, approvals, and creation events. SalesCRM's TimelineSection is broader—it consolidates tasks, contact events, status changes, deal stage changes, and notes into a chronological feed where each item can be clicked through to its detail page. These are conceptually similar enough that a shared timeline component would make sense, though SalesCRM's version is more feature-rich with the clickable navigation.\n\nSo I'm planning to create subtasks for two shared components: one for documents/attachments across both apps, and one for timelines. But I'm realizing the skill structure expects one subtask for app-wide logic and one per page, whereas these components span multiple pages. I think the practical approach is to just create subtasks for the shared components themselves rather than organizing by page. I'm settling on organizing the subtasks by page since each has a distinct primary component to write—DocumentsSection for SupplierDetailsPage and TimelineSection for OrderDetailsPage, which will reuse the DocumentsSection from the first subtask. All subtasks will use the same skill path since they're part of the same task, so I'm ready to formulate the add-task command with the appropriate parameters. I'm reconsidering whether TimelineSection is the right shared component to extract. Looking at the actual usage patterns across the apps, the timeline implementations have different requirements and structures that might not align well for sharing. Tracker OrderHistory:\n- Vertical timeline of events\n- Reverse chronological order\n- Each entry: timestamp, description, icon by event type\n- Event types with distinct icons: status change, document, approval, creation\n- New entries added when status changes, line items modified, documents uploaded\n\nSalesCRM TimelineSection (from ClientDetailPage spec):\n- Consolidated chronological feed of tasks, contact events, status changes, deal stage changes, notes/writeups\n- Each can be clicked to go to its detail page\n\nThese share the \"timeline of events\" pattern but differ in:\n- SupplierTracker: simple display with icons\n- SalesCRM: clickable entries that navigate to detail pages, more diverse event types\n\nThey're similar enough for a shared component with some configurability. I'll include it.\n\nBut looking at the skill requirements, I should add subtasks for future workers rather than implement this now—the guidelines say to unpack work across apps into subtasks and not
