There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_013bTaFcLz3TsVXnU4yLD9NA","session_id":"f092425f-f5fa-4471-a5a7-dea6643c7d03","uuid":"c50fbc53-a68a-4e69-aa0d-dc8272623d7b"}

Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_013bTaFcLz3TsVXnU4yLD9NA","session_id":"f092425f-f5fa-4471-a5a7-dea6643c7d03","uuid":"08f3157d-8a4b-4e28-a091-7b7c0b264cc0"}

If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints.

Now let me compile the comprehensive report with all the information you requested:\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nI've successfully located all the relevant files you requested. Here's the complete report:\n\n### Apps Directory Structure\n\nThe `/repo/apps/` directory contains the following applications:\n1. **Accounting** - Primary app with extensive test specifications\n2. **InventoryTracker**\n3. **ProductionHub**\n4. **SalesCRM**\n5. **SupplierTracker**\n\nEach app has a `docs/` directory containing `tests.md` files with test specifications.\n\n---\n\n### Files Found and Locations\n\n#### 1. **docs/tests.md in Accounting App**\n**Path:** `/repo/apps/Accounting/docs/tests.md`\n- **Size:** 132,264 bytes\n- **Content:** Comprehensive test specification for the Accounting platform application covering multiple pages including AccountsPage, AccountDetailPage, ReportListPage, CreateReportDialog, and more.\n- **Structure:** Organized by page with component-based test entries following BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) format with Initial state, Action, and Expected outcome for each test\n\n#### 2. **testSpec.md Skill File**\n**Path:** `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md`\n- **Size:** 6,337 bytes\n- **Content:** A skill specification file that provides instructions for writing complete, detailed test specifications for apps based on initial app specifications\n- **Key Sections:**\n  - Unpack Subtasks (how to break down test spec tasks)\n  - Requirements (test spec must be in docs/tests.md, matched to app spec, use BDD format)\n  - Directives (inventory every visible element, test all clickable elements, verify appearance, test modal dialogs, etc.)\n  - Tips (mockup image handling, creating plan.md, parallelizing work)\n\n#### 3. **testing.md Skill File**\n**Path:** `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testing.md`\n- **Size:** 18,220 bytes\n- **Content:** Comprehensive skill specification for running and debugging Playwright tests\n- **Key Sections:**\n  - Unpack Subtasks (how to structure testing work)\n  - Requirements (ensure tests pass, app works correctly, not just hardcoded values)\n  - Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration (detailed setup for v5.0.1)\n  - Running Tests (via npm run test from app directory)\n  - Debugging Process (mandatory 8-step process for test failures)\n  - Bug Writeup Template (structured format with Evidence, Determination, and Root Cause sections)\n  - Directives (manual dev server handling, Netlify Functions configuration)\n\n#### 4. **ReportList Test File (Playwright Test)**\n**Path:** `/repo/apps/Accounting/tests/accounts-page.spec.ts`\n- **Size:** Full implementation with multiple test suites\n- **Content:** Playwright test file covering:\n  - NavBar component tests (9 tests covering navigation, logo, user info, logout)\n  - AccountsOverviewHeader tests (2 tests for title and Generate Reports button)\n  - CategorySection tests (6 tests for category display, expansion, defaults)\n  - AccountCard tests (10 tests covering display, navigation, menus, and liability-specific info)\n- **Notable Tests Include:**\n  - \"NavBar Reports link navigates to ReportList\" (line 54-65)\n  - Tests verify testIds, navigation URLs, visibility with timeouts\n  - Uses Replay browser for recording with extended timeouts (30000ms for navigation, 10000ms for assertions)\n\n#### 5. **testSpec.md in App's Docs Directory**\n**Result:** No testSpec.md file found in `/repo/apps/Accounting/docs/` or other app docs directories. Only `tests.md` files exist in the apps' docs directories.\n\n---\n\n### Key Code Example from Accounting Tests\n\nHere's the ReportList navigation test from the accounts-page.spec.ts file:\n\n```typescript\ntest(\"NavBar Reports link navigates to ReportList\", async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto(\"/accounts\");\n  await expect(page.getByTestId(\"navbar\")).toBeVisible({ timeout: 30000 });\n\n  // Click Reports link\n  await page.getByTestId(\"navbar-link-reports\").click();\n\n  // Verify navigation to ReportList\n  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/reports/);\n  await expect(page.getByTestId(\"report-list-page\")).toBeVisible({ timeout: 30000 });\n  await expect(page.getByTestId(\"navbar-link-reports\")).toHaveClass(/navbar-link--active/);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Test Specification Format (from docs/tests.md)\n\nTests in the Accounting app follow this BDD format:\n\n```\n**Test: [Test Name]**\n- **Initial state:** [Setup description]\n- **Action:** [User action description]\n- **Expected:** [Expected outcome description]\n```\n\nExample from the tests.md file:\n```\n**Test: NavBar Reports link navigates to ReportList**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the AccountsPage.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Reports\" link in the NavBar.\n- **Expected:** The app navigates to the ReportList page. The \"Reports\" link becomes highlighted/active.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Item | Path | Status |\n|------|------|--------|\n| docs/tests.md (Accounting) | `/repo/apps/Accounting/docs/tests.md` | Found |\n| testSpec.md skill | `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md` | Found |\n| testing.md skill | `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testing.md` | Found |\n| ReportList test file | `/repo/apps/Accounting/tests/accounts-page.spec.ts` | Found |\n| testSpec.md in app docs | `/repo/apps/*/docs/testSpec.md` | Not Found |\n\nAll requested files have been located and analyzed.

Now let me compile the comprehensive report with all the information you requested:\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nI've successfully located all the relevant files you requested. Here's the complete report:\n\n### Apps Directory Structure\n\nThe `/repo/apps/` directory contains the following applications:\n1. **Accounting** - Primary app with extensive test specifications\n2. **InventoryTracker**\n3. **ProductionHub**\n4. **SalesCRM**\n5. **SupplierTracker**\n\nEach app has a `docs/` directory containing `tests.md` files with test specifications.\n\n---\n\n### Files Found and Locations\n\n#### 1. **docs/tests.md in Accounting App**\n**Path:** `/repo/apps/Accounting/docs/tests.md`\n- **Size:** 132,264 bytes\n- **Content:** Comprehensive test specification for the Accounting platform application covering multiple pages including AccountsPage, AccountDetailPage, ReportListPage, CreateReportDialog, and more.\n- **Structure:** Organized by page with component-based test entries following BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) format with Initial state, Action, and Expected outcome for each test\n\n#### 2. **testSpec.md Skill File**\n**Path:** `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md`\n- **Size:** 6,337 bytes\n- **Content:** A skill specification file that provides instructions for writing complete, detailed test specifications for apps based on initial app specifications\n- **Key Sections:**\n  - Unpack Subtasks (how to break down test spec tasks)\n  - Requirements (test spec must be in docs/tests.md, matched to app spec, use BDD format)\n  - Directives (inventory every visible element, test all clickable elements, verify appearance, test modal dialogs, etc.)\n  - Tips (mockup image handling, creating plan.md, parallelizing work)\n\n#### 3. **testing.md Skill File**\n**Path:** `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testing.md`\n- **Size:** 18,220 bytes\n- **Content:** Comprehensive skill specification for running and debugging Playwright tests\n- **Key Sections:**\n  - Unpack Subtasks (how to structure testing work)\n  - Requirements (ensure tests pass, app works correctly, not just hardcoded values)\n  - Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration (detailed setup for v5.0.1)\n  - Running Tests (via npm run test from app directory)\n  - Debugging Process (mandatory 8-step process for test failures)\n  - Bug Writeup Template (structured format with Evidence, Determination, and Root Cause sections)\n  - Directives (manual dev server handling, Netlify Functions configuration)\n\n#### 4. **ReportList Test File (Playwright Test)**\n**Path:** `/repo/apps/Accounting/tests/accounts-page.spec.ts`\n- **Size:** Full implementation with multiple test suites\n- **Content:** Playwright test file covering:\n  - NavBar component tests (9 tests covering navigation, logo, user info, logout)\n  - AccountsOverviewHeader tests (2 tests for title and Generate Reports button)\n  - CategorySection tests (6 tests for category display, expansion, defaults)\n  - AccountCard tests (10 tests covering display, navigation, menus, and liability-specific info)\n- **Notable Tests Include:**\n  - \"NavBar Reports link navigates to ReportList\" (line 54-65)\n  - Tests verify testIds, navigation URLs, visibility with timeouts\n  - Uses Replay browser for recording with extended timeouts (30000ms for navigation, 10000ms for assertions)\n\n#### 5. **testSpec.md in App's Docs Directory**\n**Result:** No testSpec.md file found in `/repo/apps/Accounting/docs/` or other app docs directories. Only `tests.md` files exist in the apps' docs directories.\n\n---\n\n### Key Code Example from Accounting Tests\n\nHere's the ReportList navigation test from the accounts-page.spec.ts file:\n\n```typescript\ntest(\"NavBar Reports link navigates to ReportList\", async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto(\"/accounts\");\n  await expect(page.getByTestId(\"navbar\")).toBeVisible({ timeout: 30000 });\n\n  // Click Reports link\n  await page.getByTestId(\"navbar-link-reports\").click();\n\n  // Verify navigation to ReportList\n  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/reports/);\n  await expect(page.getByTestId(\"report-list-page\")).toBeVisible({ timeout: 30000 });\n  await expect(page.getByTestId(\"navbar-link-reports\")).toHaveClass(/navbar-link--active/);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Test Specification Format (from docs/tests.md)\n\nTests in the Accounting app follow this BDD format:\n\n```\n**Test: [Test Name]**\n- **Initial state:** [Setup description]\n- **Action:** [User action description]\n- **Expected:** [Expected outcome description]\n```\n\nExample from the tests.md file:\n```\n**Test: NavBar Reports link navigates to ReportList**\n- **Initial state:** User is on the AccountsPage.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Reports\" link in the NavBar.\n- **Expected:** The app navigates to the ReportList page. The \"Reports\" link becomes highlighted/active.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Item | Path | Status |\n|------|------|--------|\n| docs/tests.md (Accounting) | `/repo/apps/Accounting/docs/tests.md` | Found |\n| testSpec.md skill | `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md` | Found |\n| testing.md skill | `/repo/skills/tasks/build/testing.md` | Found |\n| ReportList test file | `/repo/apps/Accounting/tests/accounts-page.spec.ts` | Found |\n| testSpec.md in app docs | `/repo/apps/*/docs/testSpec.md` | Not Found |\n\nAll requested files have been located and analyzed.

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n   314→  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n   315→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   316→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   317→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   318→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   319→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   320→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   321→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   322→- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n   323→  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n   324→  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n   325→- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n   326→  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n   327→  cold start latency.\n   328→- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   329→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   330→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   331→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n   332→  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n   333→  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n   334→- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n   335→  the component source.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}

The subtask says \"add missing NavBar active state test and search-no-results test for ReportList\". Let me look at the NavBar section and see what tests exist, and also check what's currently in the test spec for the ReportList.\n\nThe violation mentions:\n1. Missing NavBar active state test for ReportList\n2. Missing search-no-results test for ReportList\n\nLet me read the NavBar section of tests.md to understand what's expected, and also check the testSpec directives more carefully.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives say:\n- \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\"\n\n\n- \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n\nLooking at the ReportList section in tests.md, I can see it has ReportListHeader and ReportTable components, but there's no NavBar active state test specifically for the ReportList page. The AccountsPage has a test verifying the Reports link becomes highlighted when navigating there, so I need to add a similar test for ReportList showing that the NavBar Reports link is active on that page.\n\nFor the search-no-results scenario, I'm noticing there are tests for filtering by name and clearing searches, plus an empty state test for when no reports exist at all, but nothing covering the case where a search query returns zero results. I should check the accounts page tests to see how they handle this distinction.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3934,"cache_read_input_tokens":37928,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3934,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f092425f-f5fa-4471-a5a7-dea6643c7d03","uuid":"28c04cba-138c-4bda-9553-f007bf340d09"}

I need to:\n\n1. Add two missing test entries to docs/tests.md in the ReportList section:\n   - **NavBar Reports link is active** - A test that verifies the Reports NavBar link is active when the user is on the ReportList page (similar to the TransactionsPageHeader test on line 1285)\n   - **Search no results displays empty state** - A test for when a search query matches no reports (the component already handles this at line 118-123 with `sorted.length === 0` showing \"No reports found\")\n\nLet me also check if there's a Playwright test file for the ReportList page, or if the tests need to be added to an existing file. \n\nLooking at the test files, I see accounts-page.spec.ts, account-detail-page.spec.ts, and deployment.spec.ts, but no report-list-page.spec.ts. Since the task is to fix testSpec violations, I need to add the missing test entries to docs/tests.md rather than create new Playwright tests.\n\nI need to insert two missing tests under the ReportListHeader component section: a NavBar active state test and a search-no-results test. I'll add these right after the existing ReportListHeader tests, before the ReportTable component section starts. I need to place the NavBar active state test before the page title test for ReportListHeader, matching the TransactionsPage pattern, and then add the search-no-results test after the search bar restoration test.

now.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3597,"cache_read_input_tokens":47988,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3597,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens

The task says \"Fix testSpec violations - add missing NavBar active state test and search-no-results test for ReportList\". Since this is about fixing the testSpec (docs/tests.md), not writing Playwright tests, I think I've done the right thing by adding the two missing test entries to docs/tests.md.\n\nNow I need to move to subtask 2: RunTests. The testing.md skill says to run tests via `npm run test` from the app directory. But since there are no ReportList test files, I should run the existing test suite to make sure my docs changes don't break anything.\n \nThe checkDirectives skill confirms I need to run tests and verify they pass after my fix. Since I only modified docs/tests.md without changing any actual code or test files, the existing tests should still pass, but I should run them to be sure.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":147,"cache_read_input_tokens":54616,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":147,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"f092425f-f5fa-4471-a5a7-dea6643c7d03","uuid":"69738776-7fac-46b8-83f7-7def7c46a081"}

Include the uploaded recording ID\n    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n\n11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: One-line summary only. Never verbose test output.\n- **`logs/test-run-N.log`**: Full Playwright output, recording metadata, and upload results.\n  `N` increments each run (find the highest existing number and add 1).\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON. The\n  `addMetadata` entries contain `metadata.test.result` which indicates pass/fail.\n- The Playwright config must use the Replay browser via `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n  from `@replayio/playwright` and include `replayReporter` with `upload: false`.\n- The HTML reporter must use `open: 'never'` to suppress the interactive \"Serving HTML report\"\n  prompt that blocks the script from exiting.\n- Run Playwright with `--retries 0` — no retries. Failures must be analyzed via Replay.\n- Do NOT inherit stdio from Playwright. Pipe stdout and stderr to the log file using\n  `child_process.execSync` with `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` or similar, then write\n  the captured output to the log file.\n- Use the JSON reporter (`test-results/results.json`) to parse pass/fail counts for the\n  summary line.\n- The `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` env var is already set in the container.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}
