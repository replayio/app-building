You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `strategies/jobs`: Strategies for performing jobs. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `jobs`: The job queue (`jobs.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}
