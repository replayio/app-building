The page includes navigation controls to move between weeks/months, and may integrate data from external inventory and delivery scheduling apps to visually indicate availability constraints (e.g., color coding runs with material shortages). Drag-and-drop or editing of events may be used to reschedule runs.

How seed-db scripts retrieve DATABASE_URL:**\n- **Location**: `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/scripts/seed-db.ts` and `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/scripts/seed-db.ts`\n- **Method**: The script accepts DATABASE_URL in two ways (in this order):\n  ```typescript\n  const databaseUrl = process.argv[2] || process.env.DATABASE_URL;\n  ```\n  - First: As a command-line argument: `npx tsx scripts/seed-db.ts <DATABASE_URL>`\n  - Second: From the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable\n\n**2. How deployed apps store DATABASE_URL:**\n- Both Accounting and InventoryTracker store deployment info in `deployment.txt` files at the root of their app directories\n- **File format** (`/repo/apps/Accounting/deployment.txt` and `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/deployment.txt`):\n  ```\n  url=https://...netlify.app\n  site_id=<netlify-site-uuid>\n  neon_project_id=<neon-project-id>\n  database_url=postgresql://neondb_owner:...\n  ```\n\n**3. The deploy script (`deploy.ts`) handles:**\n- Reads from `.env` file if it exists\n- Falls back to `deployment.txt` to populate `.env` with `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`, `NEON_PROJECT_ID`, and `DATABASE_URL`\n- Creates new Neon projects if `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is missing\n- Sets the `DATABASE_URL` as a Netlify environment variable for serverless functions\n\n### For ProductionHub:\n\n**Current status**: ProductionHub does NOT have:\n- A `deploy.ts` script\n- A `deployment.txt` file with the DATABASE_URL\n- A `.env` file with DATABASE_URL\n\n**To run `npm run seed-db` for ProductionHub, you need to:**\n\n1. **Option A**: Pass the DATABASE_URL directly as an argument:\n   ```bash\n   cd /repo/apps/ProductionHub\n   npx tsx scripts/seed-db.ts \"postgresql://...\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Option B**: Create a `.env` file in ProductionHub root:\n   ```bash\n   cd /repo/apps/ProductionHub\n   echo \"DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...\" > .env\n   npm run seed-db\n   ```\n\n3. **Option C**: Set as environment variable and run:\n   ```bash\n   cd /repo/apps/ProductionHub\n   DATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://...\" npm run seed-db\n   ```\n\n### What's needed to match other apps:\n\nTo fully match Accounting and InventoryTracker setup, ProductionHub would need:\n1. A `deploy.ts` script (based on `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/scripts/deploy.ts`)\n2. A `deployment.txt` file with the actual Netlify site ID and database URL after deployment\n\n### Relevant Files for Reference:\n- **Deploy script pattern**: `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/scripts/deploy.ts` (lines 77-90 show deployment.txt handling)\n- **Seed-db script pattern**: `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/scripts/seed-db.ts` (lines 3-7 show DATABASE_URL retrieval)\n- **Deployed app examples**:\n  - `/repo/apps/Accounting/deployment.txt`\n  - `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/deployment.txt`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a14c328f1a67d68d3 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 37163\ntool_uses: 23\nduration_ms: 28681</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8ca8196f-5866-4dcf-8663-34a04eb6b0ff","uuid":"f8d90d87-280a-41ba-9dd5-c25dd5292b60","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Search the codebase for how other apps get their DATABASE_URL for seed-db scripts.
