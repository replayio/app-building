Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load.

Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"25fd35d2-2ed8-4827-9279-3cb36b38c7c7","uuid":"49630ec2-778b-4ce5-8507-b23f4be859aa","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

time.\n\n**StatusFilter: Empty state when no apps match filter**\nGiven the user is on MainPage and there are no apps with status \"Queued\",\nwhen the user clicks the \"Queued\" tab,\nthe tab becomes selected and the AppCardGrid area displays an empty state (no app cards shown).\nThe StatusFilter remains functional and the user can switch to other tabs.\n\n### RequestAppCTA\n\n**RequestAppCTA: Visible below StatusFilter**\nGiven the user navigates to MainPage (/),\nthe \"Request an app\" CTA is visible as a prominent full-width button with a blue gradient background, positioned between the StatusFilter and the AppCardGrid.\nThe button text reads \"Request an app\".\n\n**RequestAppCTA: Navigates to RequestPage on click**\nGiven the user is on MainPage,\nwhen the user clicks the \"Request an app\" button,\nthe app navigates to the RequestPage (/request).\nThe RequestPage wizard is displayed.\n\n**RequestAppCTA: Remains visible across all filter tabs**\nGiven the user is on MainPage with the \"Building\" tab selected,\nwhen the user switches to the \"Finished\" tab or the \"Queued\" tab,\nthe \"Request an app\" CTA button remains visible and in the same position between the StatusFilter and the AppCardGrid.\nIt does not disappear or move when the filter changes.\n\n### AppCard\n\n**AppCard: Displays title and description**\nGiven there is an app with title \"Inventory Management System\" and description \"Autonomous system to track and order stock in real-time, integrating with suppliers and sales data.\",\nwhen the MainPage loads and the app matches the selected filter,\nthe AppCard displays the app title in bold and the description text below it.\n\n**AppCard: Shows progress bar with percentage for Building apps**\nGiven there is an app with status \"Building\" and build progress at 65%,\nwhen the MainPage loads with the \"Building\" filter selected,\nthe AppCard displays a horizontal progress bar at the top of the card.\nThe progress bar shows a blue filled portion proportional to 65% on a gray track.\nNext to the progress bar, the text \"65% Building\" is displayed.\n\n**AppCard: Shows progress bar at 100% for Finished apps**\nGiven there is an app with status \"Finished\",\nwhen the MainPage loads with the \"Finished\" filter selected,\nthe AppCard displays a progress bar filled to 100% and the status text indicates \"Finished\" (e.g., \"100% Finished\").\n\n**AppCard: Shows progress bar at 0% for Queued apps**\nGiven there is an app with status \"Queued\",\nwhen the MainPage loads with the \"Queued\" filter selected,\nthe AppCard displays a progress bar with 0% fill and the status text indicates \"Queued\" (e.g., \"0% Queued\").\n\n**AppCard: View App button navigates to AppPage**\nGiven the user is on MainPage and an AppCard is visible for an app with id \"inventory-management\",\nwhen the user clicks the blue \"View App\" button on that card,\nthe app navigates to the AppPage at /apps/inventory-management.\n\n**AppCard: Displays app route path next to View App button**\nGiven an AppCard is displayed for an app with id \"inventory-management\",\nthe card shows the route path \"/apps/inventory-management\" as text next to the \"View App\" button, indicating where the link leads.\n\n**AppCard: View App button styling**\nGiven an AppCard is displayed,\nthe \"View App\" button appears as a blue rounded button with white text, matching the mockup styling.\n\n### AppCardGrid\n\n**AppCardGrid: Displays cards in 2-column grid layout**\nGiven there are multiple apps matching the selected filter,\nwhen the MainPage loads,\nthe AppCardGrid displays AppCards in a 2-column grid layout.\nCards fill left-to-right, top-to-bottom (first card top-left, second card top-right, third card bottom-left, etc.).\n\n**AppCardGrid: Filters cards based on StatusFilter selection**\nGiven there are apps in all three states (Building, Finished, Queued),\nwhen the user selects \"Building\" in the StatusFilter,\nthe AppCardGrid shows only apps with status \"Building\".\nWhen the user switches to \"Finished\", only finished apps are shown.\nWhen the user switches to \"Queued\", only queued apps are shown.\n\n**AppCardGrid: Empty state when no apps match filter**\nGiven there are no apps with status \"Queued\",\nwhen the user selects the \"Queued\" tab in the StatusFilter,\nthe AppCardGrid displays an empty state message or placeholder indicating no apps are available in this category.\n\n**AppCardGrid: Updates when new apps are added**\nGiven the user is on MainPage with the \"Queued\" filter selected,\nwhen a new app request is accepted and queued (e.g., by another user or after the current user submits a request and returns to MainPage),\nthe AppCardGrid includes the newly queued app as an AppCard on page refresh or next data fetch.\n\n**AppCardGrid: Responsive layout**\nGiven the user is on MainPage on a standard desktop viewport,\nthe AppCardGrid displays cards in a 2-column layout as shown in the mockup, with consistent spacing between cards.\n\n## AppPage (/apps/:id)\n\n<!-- Components: AppHeader, AppActions, ActivityLog,
