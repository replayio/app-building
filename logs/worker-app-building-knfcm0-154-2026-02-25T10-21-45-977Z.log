Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"29543361-a16e-4e76-a799-a94c8a329ee2","uuid":"a49a2129-e7c5-465e-86b5-84683dd21fa5","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"29543361-a16e-4e76-a799-a94c8a329ee2","uuid":"281cf786-e643-4b6f-be7d-9c10bff2a459","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"29543361-a16e-4e76-a799-a94c8a329ee2","uuid":"219ee92c-8223-453f-bb60-85887dbb6ae3","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

I now have a comprehensive understanding of the SalesCRM app patterns. Let me create a detailed summary document for you.\n\n## Comprehensive SalesCRM App Architecture Summary\n\nBased on my analysis of the codebase, here's a detailed guide to the existing patterns you can use when building new components:\n\n---\n\n### 1. REDUX SLICE PATTERN\n\n**State Shape Structure:**\n```typescript\n// Most slices follow this pattern\ninterface ItemsState {\n  items: ItemType[];\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n  // Optional: additional related data (clients, users, etc.)\n  clients?: Client[];\n  users?: User[];\n}\n\nconst initialState: ItemsState = {\n  items: [],\n  loading: false,\n  error: null,\n};\n```\n\n**Redux Thunk Pattern:**\n- All API calls are wrapped in `createAsyncThunk`\n- Thunks use `fetch` API with auth headers from localStorage\n- Auth headers pattern: `Authorization: Bearer ${token}`\n- Error handling: Parse response JSON and throw errors with meaningful messages\n\n**Example from tasksSlice.ts:**\n- `fetchAllTasks`: GET /.netlify/functions/tasks\n- `fetchTaskClients`: GET /.netlify/functions/clients\n- `fetchTaskUsers`: GET /.netlify/functions/users\n- `createTask`: POST with task data\n- `updateTaskStatus`: PUT with status update\n- `deleteTask`: DELETE by ID\n- `fetchClientDeals`: GET with clientId parameter\n\n**Slice Reducer Pattern:**\n```typescript\nconst slice = createSlice({\n  name: \"featureName\",\n  initialState,\n  reducers: {\n    // Sync actions (optional)\n    clearData(state) { /* reset */ }\n  },\n  extraReducers: (builder) => {\n    // Pending: set loading=true (but only if items.length === 0)\n    // Fulfilled: update items array (unshift for create, filter for delete, etc.)\n    // Rejected: set loading=false, set error message\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Load State Pattern:**\n- Only set `loading=true` when items are initially empty: `if (state.items.length === 0)`\n- This prevents loader flashing on subsequent refetches\n- Clear error on pending, set error message on rejected\n\n---\n\n### 2.

I now have a comprehensive understanding of the SalesCRM app patterns. Let me create a detailed summary document for you.\n\n## Comprehensive SalesCRM App Architecture Summary\n\nBased on my analysis of the codebase, here's a detailed guide to the existing patterns you can use when building new components:\n\n---\n\n### 1. REDUX SLICE PATTERN\n\n**State Shape Structure:**\n```typescript\n// Most slices follow this pattern\ninterface ItemsState {\n  items: ItemType[];\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n  // Optional: additional related data (clients, users, etc.)\n  clients?: Client[];\n  users?: User[];\n}\n\nconst initialState: ItemsState = {\n  items: [],\n  loading: false,\n  error: null,\n};\n```\n\n**Redux Thunk Pattern:**\n- All API calls are wrapped in `createAsyncThunk`\n- Thunks use `fetch` API with auth headers from localStorage\n- Auth headers pattern: `Authorization: Bearer ${token}`\n- Error handling: Parse response JSON and throw errors with meaningful messages\n\n**Example from tasksSlice.ts:**\n- `fetchAllTasks`: GET /.netlify/functions/tasks\n- `fetchTaskClients`: GET /.netlify/functions/clients\n- `fetchTaskUsers`: GET /.netlify/functions/users\n- `createTask`: POST with task data\n- `updateTaskStatus`: PUT with status update\n- `deleteTask`: DELETE by ID\n- `fetchClientDeals`: GET with clientId parameter\n\n**Slice Reducer Pattern:**\n```typescript\nconst slice = createSlice({\n  name: \"featureName\",\n  initialState,\n  reducers: {\n    // Sync actions (optional)\n    clearData(state) { /* reset */ }\n  },\n  extraReducers: (builder) => {\n    // Pending: set loading=true (but only if items.length === 0)\n    // Fulfilled: update items array (unshift for create, filter for delete, etc.)\n    // Rejected: set loading=false, set error message\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Load State Pattern:**\n- Only set `loading=true` when items are initially empty: `if (state.items.length === 0)`\n- This prevents loader flashing on subsequent refetches\n- Clear error on pending, set error message on rejected\n\n---\n\n### 2. USERS API ENDPOINT RESPONSE\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/users.ts`\n\n**List All Users (`GET /.netlify/functions/users`):**\n```typescript\n{\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  avatarUrl: string | null;\n  createdAt: string;\n}[]\n```\n\n**Single User with Stats (`GET /.netlify/functions/users/<id>`):**\n```typescript\n{\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  avatarUrl: string | null;\n  createdAt: string;\n  activeDeals: number;\n  totalDeals: number;\n  openTasks: number;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. LIST PAGE PATTERN\n\n**Structure:**\n```\nPage Component\n├── Header Component (page-header with title + actions)\n├── Filter/Search Component(s)\n├── Content Component (Table, Card List, etc.)\n├── Pagination Component\n└── Modal(s) (Add/Create, Import, etc.)\n```\n\n**Example: TasksListPage**\n- Fetches: `fetchAllTasks`, `fetchTaskClients`, `fetchTaskUsers` in useEffect\n- Maintains state: search, filters (priority, status, assignee, client), pagination\n- Debounces search input (300ms)\n- Uses `useMemo` to filter and sort data client-side\n- Resets pagination when filters change\n- Conditional loading state if items are empty\n- Modal for create/import functionality\n\n**Example: ContactsListPage**\n- PAGE_SIZE constant (typically 50)\n- Uses `useMemo` for filtering\n- Pagination with current page state\n- Resets to page 1 on search change\n- Returns loading state wrapper if no items and loading=true\n\n---\n\n### 4. HEADER COMPONENT PATTERN\n\n**Container:** `div.page-header` (with flex, space-between layout)\n\n**Structure:**\n```typescript\ninterface ComponentListHeaderProps {\n  onActionCallback: () => void;\n}\n\nexport function ComponentListHeader({ onActionCallback }: ComponentListHeaderProps) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div className=\"page-header\" data-testid=\"component-list-header\">\n        <div>\n          <h1 className=\"page-title\">Page Title</h1>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"component-header-actions\">\n          <button className=\"btn btn--secondary\">Import</button>\n          <button className=\"btn btn--secondary\">Export</button>\n          <button className=\"btn btn--primary\">Primary Action</button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      {/* Modals, dialogs, etc. */}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Key Patterns:**\n- Props: callbacks for actions (onCreateTask, onAddContact, etc.)\n- Uses Redux to get data (tasks, contacts) for export\n- Handles export to CSV using shared `generateCsv` utility\n- Handles import via `ImportDialog` from @shared/components\n- Icons: inline SVG with currentColor for theming\n- Buttons: `btn--primary` for main action, `btn--secondary` for secondary\n\n**Common Test IDs:**\n- `[feature]-list-header`\n- `import-btn`, `export-btn`, `new-[item]-btn`, `add-[item]-btn`\n- `import-dialog`\n\n---\n\n### 5.

CARD/GRID COMPONENT PATTERN\n\n**Example: TaskCardList**\n\n**Structure:**\n```typescript\nfunction TaskCardList({ tasks }: { tasks: Task[] }) {\n  // State management (open menus, delete confirmations)\n  const [openMenuId, setOpenMenuId] = useState<string | null>(null);\n  const [deleteConfirmId, setDeleteConfirmId] = useState<string | null>(null);\n  \n  // Click outside handler for menus\n  useEffect(() => {\n    document.addEventListener(\"mousedown\", handleClickOutside);\n    return () => document.removeEventListener(\"mousedown\", handleClickOutside);\n  }, [openMenuId, handleClickOutside]);\n  \n  // Empty state\n  if (tasks.length === 0) {\n    return <div className=\"tasks-empty\">No tasks found</div>;\n  }\n  \n  // Card list\n  return (\n    <div className=\"task-card-list\">\n      {tasks.map(task => (\n        <div className=\"task-card\" key={task.id} onClick={handleCardClick}>\n          {/* Card content */}\n          <div className=\"task-card-left\">\n            <span className={`task-card-priority ${getPriorityClass(priority)}`}>\n              {priority}\n            </span>\n            <div className=\"task-card-info\">\n              <span className=\"task-card-title\">{task.title}</span>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"task-card-right\">\n            {/* Avatar with initials fallback */}\n            {task.assigneeName && (\n              <div className=\"task-card-assignee\">\n                {task.assigneeAvatar ? (\n                  <img src={task.assigneeAvatar} alt={task.assigneeName} />\n                ) : (\n                  <span className=\"task-card-assignee-initials\">\n                    {getInitials(task.assigneeName)}\n                  </span>\n                )}\n              </div>\n            )}\n            {/* Action menu */}\n            <div className=\"task-card-actions-wrapper\">\n              <button className=\"task-card-actions-btn\" onClick={toggleMenu}>···</button>\n              {openMenuId === task.id && (\n                <div className=\"task-card-actions-menu\">\n                  <button>Edit</button>\n                  <button>Mark Complete</button>\n                  <button>Cancel</button>\n                  <button className=\"--danger\">Delete</button>\n                </div>\n              )}\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      \n      <ConfirmDialog {...deleteProps} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Key Patterns:**\n- Navigation on card click: `navigate(/path/${item.id})`\n- Action menu toggle with click outside detection\n- Confirm dialog for destructive actions\n- Helper functions for formatting (initials, priority classes, dates)\n- Test IDs: `task-card`, `task-card-priority`, `task-card-title`, `task-card-actions-btn`\n\n---\n\n### 9. DETAIL PAGE/HEADER COMPONENT\n\n**Example: DealHeader**\n\n**Props:**\n```typescript\ninterface DealHeaderProps {\n  deal: DealDetail;\n  users: DealUser[];\n}\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- Editable fields (value, stage, owner)\n- Dropdowns for selections (stage options, user options)\n- Formatted display values (currency formatting)\n- Save on Enter, cancel on Escape\n- Dispatch thunks on change (with loading states)\n- Click handlers for navigation to related entities\n- Test IDs on interactive elements\n\n**State Management:**\n```typescript\nconst [editingValue, setEditingValue] = useState(false);\nconst [valueInput, setValueInput] = useState(\"\");\nconst [selectedStage, setSelectedStage] = useState(deal.stage);\nconst [selectedOwner, setSelectedOwner] = useState(deal.ownerId || \"\");\n\n// Sync state with props on update\nuseEffect(() => {\n  setSelectedStage(deal.stage);\n}, [deal.stage]);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 10. TESTING/DEBUG PATTERNS\n\n**Common Test IDs:**\n- `[feature]-list-page`: Main page container\n- `[feature]-list-header`: Header section\n- `[feature]-empty`: Empty state\n- `[feature]-loading`: Loading state\n- `[item]-card`: Individual card\n- `[item]-card-priority`: Priority badge\n- `[item]-card-title`: Title/name\n- `[feature]-list`: Container for list\n- `import-btn`, `export-btn`, `add-[item]-btn`, `new-[item]-btn`\n- `import-dialog`\n\n---\n\n### 11. KEY PATTERNS TO FOLLOW\n\n1. **Redux State:** `items`, `loading`, `error` + optional related data\n2. **Page Flow:** useEffect dispatches fetch → selector gets data → useMemo filters/sorts → render with pagination\n3. **Headers:** page-header div with title on left, actions on right, data-testid\n4. **Buttons:** Consistent sizing, gap, flex alignment; use --primary, --secondary, --danger variants\n5. **Icons:** Inline SVG with `currentColor` and `stroke-width=\"1.3\"` or similar\n6. **Modals:** 520px max-width, centered, with header/body/footer sections\n7. **Empty/Loading:** Centered text with min-height, friendly messages\n8. **Auth:** Get token from localStorage, add to Authorization header as Bearer\n9. **Error Handling:** Catch in thunks, throw with message, display in state\n10. **Navigation:** Use `useNavigate()` for route changes, pass IDs in URLs\n\n---\n\nNow you have a comprehensive blueprint for building new components and pages in the SalesCRM app! The patterns are consistent across all existing features."}],"totalDurationMs":57524,"totalTokens":60588,"totalToolUseCount":27,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6493,"cache_read_input_tokens":49918,"output_tokens":4173,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6493},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me check what the existing users API returns for the list endpoint - it returns basic user info (id, name, email, avatarUrl, createdAt) but NOT active deals or open tasks counts. The per-user endpoint returns those stats.\n\nLooking at the spec, the team page needs:\n- A grid of user cards\n- Each card shows: avatar (with initials fallback), name, email, active deals count, open tasks count\n- Clicking a card navigates to /users/:userId\n\nSo I need to either:\n1. Modify the users API list endpoint to include stats, OR\n2. Make separate API calls for each user's stats\n\n\nOption 1 is better - the spec actually says the list endpoint should return stats, so I'll update the API to include them. Now I need to build the Redux slice for fetching users with stats, a simple header component for the team page, and a grid component to display the user cards.\n\nNow I'm putting together the page structure with the header and grid, adding the necessary styles, integrating the users reducer into the store, and making sure the API returns stats in the list view.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2066,"cache_read_input_tokens":57237,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2066,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"29543361-a16e-4e76-a799-a94c8a329ee2","uuid":"414b3679-08b0-4577-b950-4850f97801fc"}
