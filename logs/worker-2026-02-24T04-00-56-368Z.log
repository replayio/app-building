The 480px CSS breakpoint covers the gap below\n    73→Tailwind's 640px `max-sm:`.\n    74→\n    75→Do not use JavaScript-based layout switching. Do not add a hamburger menu or mobile navigation\n    76→unless the app already has one — the sidebar stays fixed.\n    77→\n    78→### Layout adjustments\n    79→\n    80→Apply these patterns at the Tailwind breakpoints:\n    81→\n    82→- **Page padding**: `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the outermost page wrapper.\n    83→- **Multi-column grids** (detail page bodies, metadata grids): start with the desktop column\n    84→  count and collapse at each breakpoint.\n    85→  - Two-column body: `grid grid-cols-2 max-md:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n    86→  - Four-column metadata: `grid grid-cols-4 max-md:grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n    87→- **Section card padding**: `p-4 max-sm:p-3` or `px-5 max-sm:px-3`.\n    88→- **Form layouts** with side-by-side fields: `grid grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`.\n    89→- **Typography scaling**: reduce heading sizes at `max-sm:`.\n    90→  - Page titles: `text-[24px] max-sm:text-[20px]`\n    91→  - Detail headings: `text-[18px] max-sm:text-[16px]`\n    92→- **Button text**: on narrow viewports, hide button labels and keep only icons:\n    93→  `<span className=\"max-sm:hidden\">Label</span>`\n    94→- **Horizontal button rows** and action bars: use `flex-wrap` so they wrap naturally.\n    95→- **Modals and dialogs**: constrain with `max-sm:max-w-[calc(100%-24px)]` and ensure\n    96→  `overflow-y-auto` for tall content.\n    97→\n    98→### Data density in lists and tables\n    99→\n   100→Lists and tables are the most important thing to get right. On wide viewports they can show many\n   101→columns, but on narrow viewports they must progressively hide less-important columns.\n   102→\n   103→- Identify which columns are essential (e.g., name, status) vs secondary (e.g., created date,\n   104→  assigned user, tags).\n   105→- **Column hiding**: Use Tailwind `max-lg:hidden` and `max-md:hidden` directly on `<th>`/`<td>`\n   106→  elements when the table is rendered with explicit column elements.

Each polish stage has a section in the file with\na checklist of completed work. Before unpacking sub-groups, read `docs/plan.md` (create it\nif it doesn't exist) and check which stages have already been completed.\n\nThe format is:\n\n```markdown\n## Polish\n\n### Responsive UI\n- [x] ClientsListPage\n- [x] ClientDetailPage\n- [ ] DealsListPage\n```\n\nWhen a polish stage is fully complete, mark it done:\n\n```markdown\n### Responsive UI ✓\n```\n\nA stage with `✓` in its heading is skipped during unpacking — no groups are added for it.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nRead `docs/plan.md` and check which polish stages still need work. For each incomplete stage,\nadd the appropriate groups as described below. After adding groups, update `docs/plan.md` with\nthe planned items (unchecked). As each job completes, check off its entry.\n\n### Responsive UI\n\nIf the `Responsive UI` section in `docs/plan.md` is missing or not marked `✓`, the app needs\nresponsive work. Read `docs/tests.md` to identify all pages, then add one group per page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/maintain/polishApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"MakeResponsive<PageName>: Make <PageName> responsive\"\n```\n\nAdd or update the `Responsive UI` section in `docs/plan.md` with an unchecked entry for each page.\n\n## Making a Page Responsive\n\nWhen working on a `MakeResponsive` job, update the page and its components so the layout adapts\ncleanly as the viewport shrinks from desktop down to mobile widths. The goal is that all content\nremains usable and readable — no horizontal scrolling, no overlapping elements, no truncated\ncontrols.\n\nAfter completing the work, check off the page in `docs/plan.md`. If all pages are done, mark the\nsection heading with `✓`.\n\n### Implementation approach\n\nUse **Tailwind responsive utility classes** (max-width variants) as the primary tool. Only fall\nback to raw CSS media queries in `index.css` when Tailwind utilities cannot express the rule\n(e.g., hiding table columns rendered from mapped data, or switching `<tr>` display modes).\n\n**Do not mix min-width and max-width variants.** Use `max-*:` variants consistently so styles\ndegrade from desktop down:\n- `max-lg:` — max-width 1024px\n- `max-md:` — max-width 768px\n- `max-sm:` — max-width 640px\n\nWhen raw CSS is needed (e.g., table column hiding via nth-child or tag selectors), use `@media\n(max-width: ...)` at 1024px, 768px, and 480px. The 480px CSS breakpoint covers the gap below\nTailwind's 640px `max-sm:`.\n\nDo not use JavaScript-based layout switching. Do not add a hamburger menu or mobile navigation\nunless the app already has one — the sidebar stays fixed.\n\n### Layout adjustments\n\nApply these patterns at the Tailwind breakpoints:\n\n- **Page padding**: `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the outermost page wrapper.\n- **Multi-column grids** (detail page bodies, metadata grids): start with the desktop column\n  count and collapse at each breakpoint.\n  - Two-column body: `grid grid-cols-2 max-md:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n  - Four-column metadata: `grid grid-cols-4 max-md:grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`\n- **Section card padding**: `p-4 max-sm:p-3` or `px-5 max-sm:px-3`.\n- **Form layouts** with side-by-side fields: `grid grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4`.\n- **Typography scaling**: reduce heading sizes at `max-sm:`.\n  - Page titles: `text-[24px] max-sm:text-[20px]`\n  - Detail headings: `text-[18px] max-sm:text-[16px]`\n- **Button text**: on narrow viewports, hide button labels and keep only icons:\n  `<span className=\"max-sm:hidden\">Label</span>`\n- **Horizontal button rows** and action bars: use `flex-wrap` so they wrap naturally.\n- **Modals and dialogs**: constrain with `max-sm:max-w-[calc(100%-24px)]` and ensure\n  `overflow-y-auto` for tall content.\n\n### Data density in lists and tables\n\nLists and tables are the most important thing to get right. On wide viewports they can show many\ncolumns, but on narrow viewports they must progressively hide less-important columns.\n\n- Identify which columns are essential (e.g., name, status) vs secondary (e.g., created date,\n  assigned user, tags).\n- **Column hiding**: Use Tailwind `max-lg:hidden` and `max-md:hidden` directly on `<th>`/`<td>`\n  elements when the table is rendered with explicit column elements. When columns are generated\n  from mapped data or use CSS Grid, define named classes in `index.css` with `@media` rules.\n- **Card mode at narrowest viewport**: At 480px (via `@media` in `index.css`), hide the table\n  header and switch rows to `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap` so each row reads as a card with\n  key fields only.\n- Ensure sort/filter controls remain accessible — use `flex-wrap` on filter bars so controls\n  wrap naturally on narrow viewports.\n\n### Card-based lists\n\nWhen the page uses cards instead of a table (e.g., task lists), adjust information density within\neach card at breakpoints:\n\n- At `max-lg:` hide secondary metadata (avatars, role text).\n- At `max-md:` relocate metadata that was in a side column to an inline row below the title\n  using `hidden max-md:flex`.\n- At `max-sm:` consolidate remaining metadata into a single compact row using\n  `hidden max-sm:flex`.\n","numLines":124,"startLine":1,"totalLines":124}}}
