This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- Apps that receive webhooks from external services must include a webhook help/documentation UI\n    67→  accessible from the app's status or admin page. The help UI must list each webhook endpoint with its\n    68→  URL path, HTTP method, authentication requirements (e.g., Bearer token, query parameter), required\n    69→  and optional payload fields, and an example curl command. Example curl commands must use the actual\n    70→  deployed site URL (derived from the current page origin) rather than placeholder values — commands\n    71→  should be ready to use as-is. Each curl command and endpoint URL should have a copy-to-clipboard\n    72→  button so users can quickly use them. Test entries should verify that the help UI is accessible via a\n    73→  clearly labeled button, displays accurate documentation for each webhook endpoint, uses the actual\n    74→  site URL in examples, and provides working copy buttons.\n    75→\n    76→- For apps that expose backend API endpoints (webhooks, serverless functions, etc.), the test specification\n    77→  must include entries that verify the endpoints actually function correctly — not just that their\n    78→  documentation or help UI is accurate. Test entries should cover calling each endpoint with valid inputs\n    79→  and verifying the expected side effects (e.g., database records created or updated, status transitions\n    80→  completed, downstream processes triggered).\n    81→\n    82→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    83→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    84→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    85→\n    86→## Tips\n    87→\n    88→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    89→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    90→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    91→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    92→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    93→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    94→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    95→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    96→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    97→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    98→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_015FJXbdrKW4sbrnKW2Ycwcg","session_id":"23b8f041-518b-4058-b0fc-d60ef1a99622","uuid":"daf961be-c7d8-4c39-bf80-89aee4f5b812"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n   102→  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n   103→  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n   104→  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n   105→  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n   106→  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n   107→  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n   108→\n   109→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   110→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   111→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   112→\n   113→## Tips\n   114→\n   115→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   116→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   117→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   118→  ```ts\n   119→  build: {\n   120→    sourcemap: true,\n   121→    minify: false,\n   122→  },\n   123→  define: {\n   124→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   125→  },\n   126→  ```\n   127→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   128→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   129→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   130→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   131→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   132→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   133→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   134→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   135→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   136→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   137→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   138→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   139→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   140→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   141→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   142→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   143→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   144→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   145→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   146→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   147→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   148→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   149→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   150→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   151→\n   152→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   153→  exploration and content searching.

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_015FJXbdrKW4sbrnKW2Ycwcg","session_id":"23b8f041-518b-4058-b0fc-d60ef1a99622","uuid":"986a106a-e0eb-4c4c-871e-9b3397bd692e"}

Now let me compile a comprehensive summary with all the information requested. Let me create a final summary document:\n\n## Complete Information Summary\n\nI have successfully located and read all the requested files for the LoopBuilder app. Here's the complete breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### SKILL DOCUMENTS (with DIRECTIVES sections)\n\n#### 1. **testSpec.md** (/repo/skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md)\nThis is the skill document for writing complete, detailed test specifications. Key contents:\n\n**DIRECTIVES:**\n- Images of different pages might not have consistent styling—prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows\n- For every clickable element, specify the exact navigation target or action result\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects\n- Button and control appearance matters—verify appearance, not just existence\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless specified otherwise\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n- Backend integrations that users can configure must include complete setup instructions\n- Apps receiving webhooks must include help/documentation UI with URL paths, HTTP methods, authentication requirements, and example curl commands\n- For apps exposing backend API endpoints, test specification must include entries verifying endpoints actually function\n- State-changing actions must have tests where other parts update appropriately\n- For timeline/history features, every mutation must write a history entry\n- For reciprocal relationships, creating/updating/deleting one side must update the other\n\n#### 2. **writeApp.md** (/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md)\nThis is the skill document for writing the database and code for apps. Key contents:\n\n**DIRECTIVES:**\n- Always run `npm run check` from the app directory, not standalone `npx tsc`\n- When working on a component, identify relevant test entries and satisfy requirements\n- Match visual appearance to mockup: button variants, icons, badges, section layouts\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements during initial development\n- In monorepo subdirectories, add `base = \"apps/AppName\"` to `netlify.toml`\n- When using neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax for queries\n- For DATE, TIMESTAMP, UUID columns, convert empty strings to null with `value || null`\n- Netlify Functions at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have function name at path index 2 and resource ID at index 3\n- When building modals that reference other entities, use searchable select/dropdown, not plain text input for IDs\n- Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links to the same URL\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` for filter controls—use custom dropdown components\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads\n- Netlify Functions doing long-running operations must use Netlify Background Functions\n- Every page component must include consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`) so content never flush against screen edges\n\n#### 3. **writeTests.md** (/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md)\nThis is the skill document for writing Playwright tests. Key contents:\n\n**DIRECTIVES:**\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely—assert URL or page content after click\n- When test spec implies component is available across multiple pages, tests must interact with it on each page\n- For actions with side effects, write assertions verifying both primary effect and side effect, and that they happen exactly once\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words—prefer `getByTestId` or `getByRole` with exact matching\n- All `data-testid` values for same component must be consistent across all test files\n- When test spec describes file upload, test must exercise actual file upload mechanics\n- NEVER put Playwright auto-wait semantics inside `.toPass()` retry blocks on dynamic elements—use atomic assertions instead\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks\n- For assertions depending on backend round-trips, use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`)\n- For multi-step end-to-end flows, add `test.slow()` to triple default timeout\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/`, not inside app directory\n- For deployment tests: use correct `data-testid` values, handle empty-state scenarios, use generous timeouts\n- When test spec describes editing specific fields, test must exercise that exact field with all interactions\n- Apps with login/signup must have complete e2e test exercising full flow against real auth backend\n- Auth flows with email-based verification must exercise real production code path without IS_TEST bypass\n- Tests run in parallel—don't rely on fixed total count of records\n- Use `fullyParallel: true` in Playwright config, not `workers: 1`\n- Use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`, not standard Chrome\n- Set Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms\n\n---\n\n### LOOPBUILDER APP STRUCTURE\n\n#### **RequestPage-Related Source Files**\n\n**1. RequestPage.tsx** (/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/pages/RequestPage.tsx)\n- Main page component that orchestrates the request wizard\n- Uses Redux dispatch to reset request on unmount\n- Conditionally renders: DescribeAppForm, AssessmentScreen, RejectionResult, or AcceptanceResult based on wizard step\n- Has `data-testid=\"request-page\"`\n\n**2. RequestPage.css** (/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/pages/RequestPage.css)\n- Styles the main container with max-width 960px, centered, 24px padding\n- Responsive: 12px padding on mobile\n- Defines content layout with flex column and gaps\n\n**3. requestSlice.ts** (/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/store/requestSlice.ts)\n- Redux slice managing request state:\n  - `step`: WizardStep ('describe' | 'assessment' | 'confirmation')\n  - `appName`, `appDescription`, `appRequirements`: form fields\n  - `assessmentResult`: AssessmentResult ('pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected')\n  - `rejectionReason`: string\n  - `createdAppId`: string | null\n  - `submitting`: boolean\n  - `error`: string | null\n- `submitRequest` async thunk that POSTs to `/.netlify/functions/request`\n- Reducers: setAppName, setAppDescription, setAppRequirements, goToStep, resetRequest\n\n**4. request.ts (Netlify Function)** (/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/netlify/functions/request.ts)\n- POST endpoint that:\n  - Validates request (disallowed keywords, name length >3, description length >10)\n  - If rejected: inserts to app_requests table with status 'rejected'\n  - If accepted: \n    - Generates appId from name (lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with dash)\n    - Inserts to apps table with status 'queued'\n    - Inserts to app_requests table with status 'accepted'\n  - Returns JSON response with `result` ('accepted'|'rejected') and optional `rejectionReason` or `appId`\n- Uses neon serverless driver with tagged template SQL queries\n\n**5. RequestAppCTA.tsx** (/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/RequestAppCTA.tsx)\n- Navigation component with button that navigates to `/request`\n- Has `data-testid=\"request-app-cta\"`\n- Styled with CSS variables for gradient\n\n**6.

Confirmation\"\n- Shows step number or checkmark (✓) based on completion\n- Has connectors between steps with completion styling\n- `data-testid=\"wizard-stepper\"` with testids for individual steps and connectors\n- Not clickable—read-only progress indicator\n\n**8. DescribeAppForm.tsx** (/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/DescribeAppForm.tsx)\n- Form with three fields:\n  - App Name (text input): `data-testid=\"app-name-input\"`\n  - Description (textarea): `data-testid=\"app-description-input\"`\n  - Requirements (textarea): `data-testid=\"app-requirements-input\"`\n- Submit button: `data-testid=\"describe-app-form-submit\"` (disabled while submitting)\n- Button text changes to \"Submitting...\" during submission\n- Dispatches `submitRequest` on submit\n- Has error display: `data-testid=\"describe-app-form-error\"`\n- Can submit only if appName and appDescription are non-empty\n\n**9. AssessmentScreen.tsx** (/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/AssessmentScreen.tsx)\n- Two-column layout:\n  - Left: \"Request Summary\" panel showing appName, appDescription, appRequirements\n  - Right: Assessment progress display\n- Shows heading \"Assessing Request against Policy & Technical Criteria...\"\n- Has progress bar (visual), waiting message, and loading spinner\n- `data-testid=\"assessment-screen\"`, `data-testid=\"assessment-summary\"`, `data-testid=\"assessment-progress\"`\n- Summary fields have `data-testid=\"assessment-summary-name\"`, `data-testid=\"assessment-summary-description\"`, `data-testid=\"assessment-summary-requirements\"`\n\n**10.

Key contents:\n\n**DIRECTIVES:**\n- Images of different pages might not have consistent styling—prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows\n- For every clickable element, specify the exact navigation target or action result\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects\n- Button and control appearance matters—verify appearance, not just existence\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless specified otherwise\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n- Backend integrations that users can configure must include complete setup instructions\n- Apps receiving webhooks must include help/documentation UI with URL paths, HTTP methods, authentication requirements, and example curl commands\n- For apps exposing backend API endpoints, test specification must include entries verifying endpoints actually function\n- State-changing actions must have tests where other parts update appropriately\n- For timeline/history features, every mutation must write a history entry\n- For reciprocal relationships, creating/updating/deleting one side must update the other\n\n#### 2. **writeApp.md** (/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md)\nThis is the skill document for writing the database and code for apps. Key contents:\n\n**DIRECTIVES:**\n- Always run `npm run check` from the app directory, not standalone `npx tsc`\n- When working on a component, identify relevant test entries and satisfy requirements\n- Match visual appearance to mockup: button variants, icons, badges, section layouts\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements during initial development\n- In monorepo subdirectories, add `base = \"apps/AppName\"` to `netlify.toml`\n- When using neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax for queries\n- For DATE, TIMESTAMP, UUID columns, convert empty strings to null with `value || null`\n- Netlify Functions at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have function name at path index 2 and resource ID at index 3\n- When building modals that reference other entities, use searchable select/dropdown, not plain text input for IDs\n- Navigation sidebars must not contain duplicate links to the same URL\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` for filter controls—use custom dropdown components\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons/thumbnails\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads\n- Netlify Functions doing long-running operations must use Netlify Background Functions\n- Every page component must include consistent padding (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`) so content never flush against screen edges\n\n#### 3. **writeTests.md** (/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md)\nThis is the skill document for writing Playwright tests. Key contents:\n\n**DIRECTIVES:**\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely—assert URL or page content after click\n- When test spec implies component is available across multiple pages, tests must interact with it on each page\n- For actions with side effects, write assertions verifying both primary effect and side effect, and that they happen exactly once\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words—prefer `getByTestId` or `getByRole` with exact matching\n- All `data-testid` values for same component must be consistent across all test files\n- When test spec describes file upload, test must exercise actual file upload mechanics\n- NEVER put Playwright auto-wait semantics inside `.toPass()` retry blocks on dynamic elements—use atomic assertions instead\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach` hooks\n- For assertions depending on backend round-trips, use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`)\n- For multi-step end-to-end flows, add `test.slow()` to triple default timeout\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/`, not inside app directory\n- For deployment tests: use correct `data-testid` values, handle empty-state scenarios, use generous timeouts\n- When test spec describes editing specific fields, test must exercise that exact field with all interactions\n- Apps with login/signup must have complete e2e test exercising full flow against real auth backend\n- Auth flows with email-based verification must exercise real production code path without IS_TEST bypass\n- Tests run in parallel—don't rely on fixed total count of records\n- Use `fullyParallel: true` in Playwright config, not `workers: 1`\n- Use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`, not standard Chrome\n- Set Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms\n\n---\n\n### LOOPBUILDER APP STRUCTURE\n\n#### **RequestPage-Related Source Files**\n\n**1.

There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- Apps that receive webhooks from external services must include a webhook help/documentation UI\n    67→  accessible from the app's status or admin page. The help UI must list each webhook endpoint with its\n    68→  URL path, HTTP method, authentication requirements (e.g., Bearer token, query parameter), required\n    69→  and optional payload fields, and an example curl command. Example curl commands must use the actual\n    70→  deployed site URL (derived from the current page origin) rather than placeholder values — commands\n    71→  should be ready to use as-is.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- Apps that receive webhooks from external services must include a webhook help/documentation UI\n  accessible from the app's status or admin page. The help UI must list each webhook endpoint with its\n  URL path, HTTP method, authentication requirements (e.g., Bearer token, query parameter), required\n  and optional payload fields, and an example curl command. Example curl commands must use the actual\n  deployed site URL (derived from the current page origin) rather than placeholder values — commands\n  should be ready to use as-is. Each curl command and endpoint URL should have a copy-to-clipboard\n  button so users can quickly use them. Test entries should verify that the help UI is accessible via a\n  clearly labeled button, displays accurate documentation for each webhook endpoint, uses the actual\n  site URL in examples, and provides working copy buttons.\n\n- For apps that expose backend API endpoints (webhooks, serverless functions, etc.), the test specification\n  must include entries that verify the endpoints actually function correctly — not just that their\n  documentation or help UI is accurate. Test entries should cover calling each endpoint with valid inputs\n  and verifying the expected side effects (e.g., database records created or updated, status transitions\n  completed, downstream processes triggered).\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks.

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n   102→  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n   103→  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n   104→  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n   105→  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n   106→  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n   107→  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n   108→\n   109→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   110→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   111→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   112→\n   113→## Tips\n   114→\n   115→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   116→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   117→  and developer warnings.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files.

N/A for this check.\n\n**Directive 2: \"When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\"**\n- I need to check each component against its test entries. Let me go through them:\n\n**WizardStepper**: \n- Test: \"Displays three labeled steps\" → Component shows 3 steps with labels \"1. Describe App\", \"2. \n\nAssessment\", \"3. Confirmation\" ✓\n- Test: \"Step 1 active on initial load\" → Active step gets `--active` class ✓\n- Test: \"Step 1 completed and Step 2 active during assessment\" → Completed shows ✓, active shows number ✓\n- Test: \"Steps 1 and 2 completed and Step 3 active on confirmation\" → Works via currentStep prop ✓\n- Test: \"Steps are not clickable for navigation\" → No onClick handlers on steps ✓\n\n**DescribeAppForm**: Checking the form fields against the test requirements for step 1, verifying that all expected inputs and validations are present in the component.\n\nThe form has the three required fields with proper labels and controlled inputs that dispatch to Redux, plus a blue submit button. Validation correctly requires all three fields to be filled, but I'm noticing the tests expect per-field error messages to display near each input, and the current implementation doesn't show those inline validation errors. The test spec explicitly requires validation error messages displayed near each field, but the current implementation only disables the submit button—this is a violation of directive 2 which requires the app code to satisfy the entry requirements. I need to determine if this is actually a problem for the CheckComponentsRequestPage subtask or if I'm conflating test specs with the writeApp.md directives.\n\nNow I'm checking the other components against their test specs: AssessmentScreen properly handles the loading state with a heading, progress bar, waiting text, and spinner, displays the request summary in a two-column layout, animates the progress bar with CSS, and transitions between rejection and acceptance states through Redux. RejectionResult is next on my list. message\" → Uses appName in message ✓\n- Test: \"Displays Next Steps section\" → Shows \"Next Steps\" with appropriate text ✓\n- Test: \"Go to AppPage button visible and styled\" → Link styled as primary blue button ✓\n- Test: \"Go to AppPage button navigates\" → Link to `/apps/${createdAppId}` ✓\n- Test: \"View all My Apps link visible\" → Link to \"/\" styled as text link ✓\n- Test: \"View all My Apps link navigates to MainPage\" → Link to \"/\" ✓\n\nThe visual styling looks good against the mockup requirements. Now I'm checking that all interactive elements and containers have proper `data-testid` attributes for testing purposes. I've verified that all the major components have comprehensive test ID coverage across the request flow—from the initial form through assessment and final results screens. Now I'm moving on to check how test IDs should be structured in a monorepo setup.\n\nFor the Netlify configuration, I need to confirm that `netlify.toml` has the correct base path set for the SalesCRM app subdirectory. I'm also verifying that the request handler uses the proper Neon serverless driver syntax with tagged template literals, and that empty strings are being converted to null for date and timestamp fields as required. The function routing structure looks correct for accessing the resource ID from the URL path.\n\nNow checking the remaining directives — the request page doesn't use modals, sidebars, native select elements, or attachments, so those don't apply. The database operations are straightforward inserts rather than long-running tasks, so background functions aren't needed either.\n\nFor the padding directive, the CSS uses 24px and 12px at smaller breakpoints, which matches the Tailwind equivalents of `p-6` and `max-sm:p-3` exactly.\n\nLooking at the components, I notice the DescribeAppForm doesn't display per-field validation messages when fields are empty—it just disables the submit button instead. The test spec expects validation error text near the App Name field, which suggests this is a directive violation since the code doesn't satisfy the stated entry requirements.\n\nBut there's a logical issue here: if the button is disabled when the field is empty, the user can't actually click it, so the test scenario as written can't execute. The spec seems to assume the button remains clickable even with empty fields, which contradicts the implementation's approach.\n\nThis is a genuine violation of the test requirements, so I should add a task to fix it. Though I'm weighing whether the spec is being overly prescriptive about implementation details—the disabled button is arguably better UX, but it doesn't match what the test expects.\n\nLooking at the form logic more carefully, the button stays disabled until both fields are filled and the form isn't submitting, which means users never see validation error messages for empty fields.

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent.

Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks.
