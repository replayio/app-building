When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect.

Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n   102→  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n   103→  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n   104→  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n   105→  for up to 15 minutes.

Configure this with:\n   118→  ```ts\n   119→  build: {\n   120→    sourcemap: true,\n   121→    minify: false,\n   122→  },\n   123→  define: {\n   124→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   125→  },\n   126→  ```\n   127→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   128→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   129→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   130→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   131→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   132→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   133→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   134→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   135→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   136→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   137→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   138→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   139→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   140→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   141→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   142→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   143→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   144→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   145→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   146→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   147→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   148→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   149→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   150→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   151→\n   152→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   153→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   154→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   155→\n   156→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   157→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   158→\n   159→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   160→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   161→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   162→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   163→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   164→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"44e914a3-ecea-46c8-b8ff-72bc90a67a34","uuid":"42a16890-28a2-4b32-8ffc-4e4db6821c8f","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide. If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target.

Main page has a selector at top for which apps to show: apps currently being built, apps that have recently been finished, apps that have been queued but not started yet.  Below the selector is a \"request an app\" CTA which goes to the request page.  App cards show a title and description and link to the app page.  App page shows the above info with a link to the completed app (if available) and below that a feed with the AI output while developing the app, which is updated actively for in progress apps.  Request page is a wizard where the user describes the app they're looking for, then the system assesses whether it fits requirements (no personal info etc) and then either rejects the request with a reason or queues it and links to the page for the app.\n     3→\n     4→Pages:\n     5→\n     6→1. MainPage (/)\n     7→   Description: Main landing page for the autonomous app builder. Layout: at the top, there is a selector (e.g., tabs, dropdown, or segmented control) that filters which apps to show with three options: (1) apps currently being built, (2) apps that have recently been finished, and (3) apps that have been queued but not started yet. Directly below this selector, there is a prominent 'Request an app' call-to-action (CTA) button or section that navigates the user to the RequestPage. The main content area displays a list or grid of app cards. Each app card shows the app’s title and a short description, and each card links to that app’s dedicated AppPage. The page should support updating the visible list according to the selected filter, showing only apps in the corresponding state (in progress, recently finished, or queued).\n     8→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdqvIroDiRZOVD8n3oL79Tegv1adIFGkcmQ6HA\n     9→\n    10→2.

If a completed app is available, the page includes a clear link or button to access or open the completed app (e.g., a URL to the deployed app or a download link). Below the main info section, there is a chronological feed or activity log showing the AI output while developing the app (e.g., status updates, logs, intermediate reasoning or steps). For in-progress apps, this feed is actively updated in real time or via periodic refresh, so the user can watch the development process as it happens. For completed or queued apps, the feed shows the historical development output or indicates that development has not yet started, respectively.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdR5c80FCuTrISNsDvKXJtHUEOBkned31bC8VP\n    13→\n    14→3. RequestPage (/request)\n    15→   Description: A multi-step wizard where the user can request a new app. Step 1: the user describes the app they are looking for, likely via a text input or form with fields capturing requirements and details. After submission, the system assesses whether the request fits policy and technical requirements (e.g., no personal information, disallowed content, or other restricted criteria). Based on this assessment, the wizard either (a) rejects the request, displaying a clear rejection message and a reason for rejection, or (b) accepts the request, queues the app for autonomous building, and then shows a confirmation screen with a link to the new app’s AppPage where the user can monitor its progress. The layout should guide the user step-by-step, indicate progress through the wizard, handle validation errors, and clearly communicate the outcome of the assessment.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kds5EP7hTtGH82bSwipudoBvMJrNqh1kgO3jVR\n    17→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_018YXteNnUn9KLgSC7jZXkVp","session_id":"44e914a3-ecea-46c8-b8ff-72bc90a67a34","uuid":"f981e721-a0ac-4794-93d1-ad79b789afca"}

See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2.

Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt.

Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n     4→\n     5→## Unpack Subtasks\n     6→\n     7→Unpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n     8→\n     9→First, add a setup task:\n    10→```\n    11→npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n    12→  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n    13→  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n    14→```\n    15→\n    16→Then add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n    17→```\n    18→npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n    19→  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n    20→  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n    21→  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n    22→```\n    23→\n    24→## Guidelines\n    25→\n    26→- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Netlify Functions that perform long-running operations (e.g., spawning containers, calling external APIs\n   102→  that may take more than a few seconds, polling for readiness) must use Netlify Background Functions.\n   103→  Background functions use the v1 handler format (`export const handler: Handler`) and the `-background`\n   104→  filename suffix (e.g., `my-function-background.ts`). They return 202 immediately to the caller and run\n   105→  for up to 15 minutes. The synchronous entry-point function should validate input, insert a pending record\n   106→  in the database, trigger the background function via HTTP, and return immediately. The background function\n   107→  should update the database on completion (success or failure).\n   108→\n   109→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   110→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   111→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   112→\n   113→## Tips\n   114→\n   115→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   116→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   117→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   118→  ```ts\n   119→  build: {\n   120→    sourcemap: true,\n   121→    minify: false,\n   122→  },\n   123→  define: {\n   124→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   125→  },\n   126→  ```\n   127→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   128→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   129→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   130→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   131→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   132→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   133→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   134→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   135→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   136→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   137→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   138→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   139→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   140→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   141→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   142→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   143→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   144→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   145→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   146→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   147→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   148→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   149→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   150→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   151→\n   152→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   153→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   154→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   155→\n   156→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   157→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   158→\n   159→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   160→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   161→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   162→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   163→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   164→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_018YXteNnUn9KLgSC7jZXkVp","session_id":"44e914a3-ecea-46c8-b8ff-72bc90a67a34","uuid":"13fbc97f-721c-40e4-8eac-3aaf9d09ee1b"}

Now I have all the information I need. Let me create a comprehensive report:\n\n## LoopBuilder App Structure and Webhook Documentation Exploration\n\n### 1. App Structure Overview\n\nThe `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder` application is a React-based autonomous app builder with the following architecture:\n\n**Main Pages (4 routes):**\n- `/` - MainPage: Main landing page with app filter selector and app cards grid\n- `/apps/:id` - AppPage: Detail page for individual app with activity feed\n- `/request` - RequestPage: Multi-step wizard to request new apps\n- `/status` - StatusPage: System status dashboard with containers, webhook events, and default prompt display\n\n**Project Stack:**\n- **Framework**: React 18 with React Router v7\n- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit\n- **Styling**: CSS files with CSS variables for theming\n- **Backend**: Netlify Functions with Serverless DB (@neondatabase/serverless)\n- **Container Management**: @replayio/app-building npm package\n- **Icons**: lucide-react\n\n### 2. Webhook Documentation Components\n\n**Location**: `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/`\n\n**WebhookHelpButton.tsx** (lines 1-154):\n- Modal button component that opens a help panel with webhook endpoint documentation\n- Displays on StatusPage in the header (see StatusPage.tsx line 37)\n- Opens an overlay modal with documentation for 3 API endpoints:\n  1. `POST /.netlify/functions/app-builder-event` - for sending webhook events\n  2. `POST /.netlify/functions/spawn-container` - for spawning container to build apps\n  3. `POST /.netlify/functions/set-default-prompt` - for setting default build prompt\n\n**Key Issue Identified:**\n- Bug Report (from `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/docs/bugReports.md` line 5):\n  ```\n  \"3/1/2026: Webhook docs are not user-friendly — they need a working copy button \n  for curl commands with YOUR_SITE replaced by the actual site URL. Directives \n  should require that all info fields worth copying have a copy button.\"\n  ```\n\n### 3. Curl Command Examples in WebhookHelpButton\n\nAll three endpoints have hardcoded curl examples (lines 17-49 in WebhookHelpButton.tsx):\n\n**Example 1 (app-builder-event):**\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://YOUR_SITE/.netlify/functions/app-builder-event \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\"container_id\": \"machine-123\", \"event_type\": \"build_complete\", \"status\": \"finished\"}'\n```\n\n**Example 2 (spawn-container):**\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://YOUR_SITE/.netlify/functions/spawn-container \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\"prompt\": \"Build a todo app with authentication\"}'\n# Returns immediately with { name, status: \"pending\", prompt }\n# Container spawning runs in background; poll status endpoint for updates\n```\n\n**Example 3 (set-default-prompt):**\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://YOUR_SITE/.netlify/functions/set-default-prompt \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\"prompt\": \"Build a dashboard app with charts\"}'\n```\n\n**Issue**: All examples use placeholder `YOUR_SITE` and `YOUR_TOKEN` instead of actual values, and no copy buttons exist.\n\n### 4. Related Components and Pages\n\n**StatusPage.tsx** (lines 1-66):\n- Location: `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/pages/StatusPage.tsx`\n- Displays WebhookHelpButton in the header (line 37: `<WebhookHelpButton />`)\n- Shows three main sections:\n  1. `DefaultPromptDisplay` - displays current default prompt\n  2. `ActiveContainers` - table of running containers\n  3. `WebhookEventFeed` - feed of recent webhook events\n\n**WebhookEventFeed.tsx** (lines 1-56):\n- Displays recent webhook events received\n- Shows event timestamp, container_id, event_type, and payload summary\n- Empty state: \"No webhook events received\"\n\n**ActiveContainers.tsx** (lines 1-54):\n- Table showing active/running containers\n- Columns: Name, Status (badge), Prompt (truncated), Last Event time\n- Status badges use color variables from theme\n\n### 5. Styling Architecture\n\n**Theme Variables** (`/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/index.css`):\n- Primary color: `#3b82f6` (blue)\n- Surface/background colors, text colors, status colors (building, finished, queued, rejected)\n- Log type colors (deploy, test, reasoning, plan, init)\n- Shadow and radius variables\n- All CSS files use `var()` for theme consistency\n\n**Webhook Button Styling** (`WebhookHelpButton.css`):\n- Modal overlay with semi-transparent background\n- Panel with 720px max-width\n- Endpoint cards with borders and headers\n- Curl example code in dark code block (#1e293b bg, #e2e8f0 text)\n- **NO copy button styling** (this needs to be added)\n\n### 6. Database/State Management\n\n**statusSlice.ts** contains:\n- `WebhookEvent` type with fields: id, container_id, event_type, payload, received_at\n- Status data structure with containers, webhookEvents, defaultPrompt\n\n### 7. Test Specifications\n\n**WebhookHelpButton Tests** (`/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/docs/tests.md` lines 626-674):\n- Button visible and opens help panel\n- Shows documentation for all 3 endpoints with correct details\n- Curl examples must be accurate with correct headers and JSON\n- **NO TESTS YET** for copy button functionality\n\n### 8. AppSpec.md and Key Directives\n\n**From AppSpec.md**:\n- Three page requirements clearly defined\n- MainPage, AppPage, and RequestPage all specified with mockups\n- StatusPage not in original spec but added later (based on commit history)\n\n**From writeApp.md** (key relevant directives):\n- All JSX must be in separate component files\n- Use CSS with style variables instead of hardcoded styles\n- Add `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements and containers\n- Include proper padding on pages (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n- Components should be layout-agnostic (no outer padding/margin)\n- All interactive elements need testids for E2E tests\n\n### 9. Key Files List - Summary\n\n**Core Components:**\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/WebhookHelpButton.tsx` - Main webhook docs component\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/WebhookHelpButton.css` - Styling (no copy button yet)\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/WebhookEventFeed.tsx` - Webhook events display\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/ActiveContainers.tsx` - Container table\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/DefaultPromptDisplay.tsx` - Default prompt display\n\n**Pages:**\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/pages/StatusPage.tsx` - System status dashboard\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/pages/MainPage.tsx` - Landing page\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/pages/AppPage.tsx` - App detail page\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/pages/RequestPage.tsx` - Request wizard\n\n**Configuration:**\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/AppSpec.md` - App specification\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/AppRevisions.md` - Backend container management requirements\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/docs/tests.md` - Complete test specifications\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/docs/bugReports.md` - Open bugs (webhook copy button issue)\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/package.json` - Dependencies\n\n**Styling:**\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/index.css` - Global theme with CSS variables\n- `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/*.css` - Component-specific styles\n\n### 10. Known Issues & Directives\n\n**Bug Report (Open):**\nThe webhook documentation needs:\n1. **Copy buttons** for curl commands that work\n2. **Variable substitution**: Replace `YOUR_SITE` with actual deployed site URL\n3. **Variable substitution**: Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with a placeholder or indication of where to get it\n4. **Directive requirement**: \"All info fields worth copying have a copy button\" (per writeApp.md philosophy)\n\n**Container Spawn Endpoint Bug (Unreviewed):**\n- Endpoint doesn't actually create containers on Fly.io\n- Root cause: spawn-container.ts doesn't await the background function fetch\n- Background function needs retry logic for MANIFEST_UNKNOWN errors\n\nThis comprehensive exploration shows a well-structured React app with webhook documentation that lacks copy button functionality - a key UX feature mentioned in the bug reports and aligned with the general directive that copyable content should have copy buttons."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a0e7ac6e5147ad046 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 45818\ntool_uses: 37\nduration_ms: 70378</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"44e914a3-ecea-46c8-b8ff-72bc90a67a34","uuid":"07820b38-0409-4864-a343-29048ba2cc26","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the /repo/apps/LoopBuilder directory to understand the app structure, especially:\n1.

Let me create a comprehensive report:\n\n## LoopBuilder App Structure and Webhook Documentation Exploration\n\n### 1. App Structure Overview\n\nThe `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder` application is a React-based autonomous app builder with the following architecture:\n\n**Main Pages (4 routes):**\n- `/` - MainPage: Main landing page with app filter selector and app cards grid\n- `/apps/:id` - AppPage: Detail page for individual app with activity feed\n- `/request` - RequestPage: Multi-step wizard to request new apps\n- `/status` - StatusPage: System status dashboard with containers, webhook events, and default prompt display\n\n**Project Stack:**\n- **Framework**: React 18 with React Router v7\n- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit\n- **Styling**: CSS files with CSS variables for theming\n- **Backend**: Netlify Functions with Serverless DB (@neondatabase/serverless)\n- **Container Management**: @replayio/app-building npm package\n- **Icons**: lucide-react\n\n### 2. Webhook Documentation Components\n\n**Location**: `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/src/components/`\n\n**WebhookHelpButton.tsx** (lines 1-154):\n- Modal button component that opens a help panel with webhook endpoint documentation\n- Displays on StatusPage in the header (see StatusPage.tsx line 37)\n- Opens an overlay modal with documentation for 3 API endpoints:\n  1. `POST /.netlify/functions/app-builder-event` - for sending webhook events\n  2. `POST /.netlify/functions/spawn-container` - for spawning container to build apps\n  3. `POST /.netlify/functions/set-default-prompt` - for setting default build prompt\n\n**Key Issue Identified:**\n- Bug Report (from `/repo/apps/LoopBuilder/docs/bugReports.md` line 5):\n  ```\n  \"3/1/2026: Webhook docs are not user-friendly — they need a working copy button \n  for curl commands with YOUR_SITE replaced by the actual site URL. Directives \n  should require that all info fields worth copying have a copy button.\"\n  ```\n\n### 3.

Let me also read the Replay MCP skill file to see how to analyze recordings, and check if there's a recording ID referenced in the bug report.\n\nLooking at the bug report:\n```\n3/1/2026: Webhook docs are not user-friendly — they need a working copy button for curl commands with YOUR_SITE replaced by the actual site URL. Directives should require that all info fields worth copying have a copy button.\n```\n\nThere's no recording ID referenced. The bug is asking for:\n1. Copy buttons for curl commands \n2. `YOUR_SITE` should be replaced with the actual site URL\n\n\n3. All info fields worth copying should have a copy button\n\nThis is a feature request rather than a traditional bug, and the skill file says to skip analysis for bugs asking for new functionality. However, since AnalyzeBug is included in the subtasks, I should proceed with the analysis anyway.\n\nThe core issues are that there's no copy button for curl commands, `YOUR_SITE` isn't being replaced with the actual URL, and other copyable fields like endpoint paths and auth info lack copy buttons. Let me move forward with documenting this analysis, then implement the fix and update the tests accordingly. I should also check if a bugs directory already exists.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8448,"cache_read_input_tokens":30945,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8448,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"44e914a3-ecea-46c8-b8ff-72bc90a67a34","uuid":"6096402b-4607-4077-ab1b-e03d7782ae6e"}

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution.

The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n   314→  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n   315→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   316→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   317→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   318→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   319→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   320→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   321→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   322→- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n   323→  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n   324→  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n   325→- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n   326→  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n   327→  cold start latency.\n   328→- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   329→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   330→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   331→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n   332→  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n   333→  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n   334→- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n   335→  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n   336→  prevent with a quick source check.\n   337→- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n   338→  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n   339→  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n   340→  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n   341→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"44e914a3-ecea-46c8-b8ff-72bc90a67a34","uuid":"c62aa598-f2f3-4fab-b760-c8fd2f48e194","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/testing.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial testing task into a single task:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testing.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a task to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testing.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}

This is the single entry point for running\n     7→tests during development and debugging.\n     8→\n     9→## Usage\n    10→\n    11→- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n    12→- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n    13→- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n    14→\n    15→## Behavior\n    16→\n    17→1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n    18→   previous runs.\n    19→\n    20→2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n    21→   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n    22→\n    23→3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n    24→   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n    25→\n    26→4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n    27→   test data.\n    28→\n    29→5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n    30→   prior runs.\n    31→\n    32→6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n    33→   specified test file.

This is the single entry point for running\ntests during development and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n   previous runs.\n\n2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n\n3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n\n4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n   test data.\n\n5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n   prior runs.\n\n6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n   `DATABASE_URL`. Pipe all Playwright output to a log file (see Outputs).\n\n7. **Parse results**: Count passed/failed/skipped tests from the Playwright JSON reporter output\n   at `test-results/results.json`.\n\n8. **On failure** (non-zero exit code):\n   a. Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n   b. Append full metadata for every recording that has test metadata to the log file in a\n      delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, append `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` to the\n      log file. On failure, log the exit code.\n\n9. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n10. **Print summary** to stdout: a single line like `10 passed` or\n    `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`. Include the uploaded recording ID\n    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n\n11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`.
