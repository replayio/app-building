Review the testing strategy\n\nNow I'll examine the test spec to understand what filtering behavior is expected.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2630,"cache_read_input_tokens":23014,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2630,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"90ac0b57-f245-4c1e-a61e-52dd35132ebc","uuid":"da3f8562-caff-44e9-aa01-92735d38aa57"}

Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

menus.","signature":"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

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification).

The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   253→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   254→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   255→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   256→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.
