First, I should identify which app this is for by checking the task queue or apps directory.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2761,"cache_read_input_tokens":23768,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2761,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4d8dabf0-2a23-42ee-ae49-e9bbaef91ce7","uuid":"6365c52b-2f22-403f-b48c-74c2ac3d1516"}

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings.

Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it.

Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development.

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

The glob showed only `deployment.spec.ts` and `dashboard.spec.ts`. Let me also check for any other test files.\n\nNow let me also read the AppSpec.md to cross-reference what the mockup requires.\n\nLet me now systematically check each subtask:\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecMaterialDetailPage - testSpec.md directives\n\nLet me check each test entry against the testSpec.md directives:\n\n### testSpec.md Directives:\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n\n2. I need to inventory every visible element in each mockup — columns, filters, buttons, icons, badges, sections — and write a test for each one, since it's easy to miss minor elements.\n3. I shouldn't substitute simpler elements for what the mockup actually shows. If the mockup requires complex columns with joins or computed values, I need to test all of them, not just the easier ones. Same goes for filter controls — test all of them, not just the simplest.\n4. For every clickable element, the test must specify exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers, not leaving anything vague.\n5. For buttons that open external flows like OAuth or payment processing, I need to specify how they open (popup, redirect, etc.) and what happens when they complete.\n6. Any action that changes data needs test entries verifying the change persists and that the exact side effects occur — like history entries being created once, not duplicated.\n7. Button appearance matters too — if the mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that exact appearance, not just that a button exists.\n8. Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they work properly.\n9. File uploads should be supported unless the mockup indicates otherwise, and import dialogs need to specify the expected data format.\n10. Backend integrations that users can configure and state management also need thorough testing.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the MaterialDetailPage test entries against these guidelines. Looking at the MaterialHeader section, the tests cover the heading, category, unit of measure, description, and breadcrumb navigation with proper targets specified. The sidebar test confirms the Materials link shows as active. For the EditMaterialButton section, I'm checking that the button appearance is tested with secondary styling, the modal opens with pre-filled data, and verifying the modal behavior works as expected.\n\nContinuing through the EditMaterialButton tests, I see the edit submission updates the header immediately, canceling discards changes, and the required field validations are all in place for Material Name, Category, and Unit of Measure. Moving into the NewBatchButton section, the tests verify the button displays with primary styling, clicking it opens the create batch modal with the material pre-filled, submitting adds a new batch to the table, and the Account field validation is being checked.\n\nNow looking at the remaining batch modal validations—Quantity must be required and positive, and the cancel button properly closes without creating anything. The NewTransactionButton tests confirm it displays correctly and navigates to the transaction page with the material pre-filled. For the AccountsDistributionTable, I'm verifying the section header displays, column headers are correct, account rows show the right data, and the View Account link navigates to the correct detail page.\n\nThe nested batch expansion tests check that expanding an account reveals its batches, collapsing hides them, nested rows display correct data, batch IDs navigate to the detail page, single-batch accounts work properly, and the empty state appears when a material isn't in any account. Moving into the AllBatchesTable section, I'm testing that the heading displays, column headers are correct, batch rows show proper data, and the View Lineage link navigates to the batch detail page.\n\nNow I'm verifying the batch ID navigation works, the Account filter dropdown appears with \"All Accounts\" as default, opening it lists all relevant accounts, selecting an account filters the batches accordingly, and \"All Accounts\" resets the filter. The Date filter dropdown also defaults to \"All Dates\", shows date range options when opened, and filtering by date range works correctly. I'm also checking that both filters work together to narrow results and that empty states display when no batches exist or when filters return no results.\n\nMoving into the Transactions History section, I'm testing that it displays with proper headings and column headers, shows transaction rows with correct data, and the Accounts Involved column displays the arrow notation between source and destination accounts. Clicking a Transaction ID or Batch Reference should navigate to their respective detail pages. The Type filter defaults to \"All Types\", lists transaction type options when opened, filters transactions when a type is selected, and resets when \"All Types\" is chosen. The Date filter defaults to \"Last 30 Days\" and opens to show date range options.\n\nNow I'm checking that the Type and Date filters work together to narrow results, the table shows empty states when no transactions exist or when filters match nothing, transactions display in reverse chronological order, and creating a new transaction adds an entry to the history. Let me verify these tests against the AppSpec to see if there's a mockup I should reference and check for any visible elements that might be missing from the test coverage.\n\nLooking at the testSpec directives, I need to ensure that data mutations are properly persisted with correct side effects—the edit material, create batch, and create transaction tests all verify database persistence and table updates. The modal dialogs for editing materials and creating batches appear fully tested with open, pre-fill, save, cancel, and validation scenarios. I should also verify that every clickable element has its exact navigation path specified in the tests.\n\nNow I'm checking the navigation targets across all interactive elements—breadcrumbs route to Dashboard and Materials, account and batch links navigate to their detail pages, and the new transaction button goes to the creation form. Let me cross-reference the AppSpec for MaterialDetailPage to confirm all the mock data and expected behaviors align with what the tests are covering. I'm checking the remaining directives against the test entries—specifically whether mutations include persistence and side effect validation, button appearances are tested, modals are fully covered, file uploads work, and state changes propagate across the app. Without seeing the actual mockup in AppSpec.md, I can't fully verify that all visible elements are inventoried or that simpler elements weren't substituted, but the clickable navigation targets, mutation testing, modal coverage, and cross-component state updates all look solid. Let me pull up AppSpec.md to see the mockup and complete the directive

The only references to MaterialDetailPage in tests are from the dashboard.spec.ts file, which just tests navigation to it.\n\nNow let me also download and look at the mockup to check directive 2 (inventory every visible element). But actually, I should focus on checking the directives systematically. Let me download the mockup.\n\nActually, wait. The task is to check for directive violations. Let me think about this systematically by going through each directive and checking the test entries.\n\nLet me re-read the tests.md MaterialDetailPage section more carefully now, and also think about the AppSpec description.\n\nAppSpec says:\n\n\n- Header: material name, category, description, unit of measure\n- Buttons: Edit Material, New Batch, New Transaction\n- (1) Accounts Distribution table: Account Name, Account Type, Quantity, Number of Batches, link to account\n- Under each account: batches with Batch ID, Quantity, Unit, Created Date\n- (3) Batches - all batches for this material\n- (4) Transactions - Date, Transaction ID, Accounts involved, Batch references, Quantity moved\n- Functionality: jump to account detail, filter batches by account or date, see lineage, start new transaction pre-filled\n\nNow I'm looking at the test entries to see what's actually being tested against these specifications.\n\nI can't easily view the mockup image, so I'm going to work through the testSpec.md directives systematically. The first directive about consistent styling over exact image adherence doesn't apply to individual test entries. For the second directive about inventorying every visible element, I'd need the mockup to verify completely, but the test entries seem to cover the main header elements and sections described in the AppSpec.\n\nNow I'm checking the remaining directives — whether clickable elements specify their exact navigation targets, and whether the test entries avoid substituting easier implementations for what the mockup actually shows. The breadcrumb navigation looks properly specified with its targets, and the detailed column specifications suggest the entries aren't cutting corners on implementation details. Now I'm checking that all data mutations have proper persistence and side effect verification—edits to materials, batch creation, and transaction creation all update their respective tables and sections correctly. I'm also verifying that button styling matches the mockups, with secondary outlined buttons for edits and primary filled blue buttons for creation actions.\n\nFor the modals, both the edit material and create batch dialogs are fully tested across opening, pre-filling, saving, canceling, and validation scenarios. Since there's no attachment functionality shown on this page and the import/upload requirements are still being reviewed, I'm moving through the remaining directives to ensure complete coverage.\n\nNow I'm double-checking the breadcrumb test entries more carefully—the test spec says it should display \"Home > Materials > Material Name\" but I'm noticing the actual text might be slightly different.\n\nLooking at the New Transaction button test, it specifies navigation to NewTransactionPage with the material pre-filled in the batch allocation section, which is concrete enough. I'm also scanning through to see if there are any other gaps in the test coverage I might have missed.\n\nThe filter controls look complete across both tables—AllBatchesTable covers Account and Date filtering, while TransactionsHistoryTable has Type and Date filters, matching what the AppSpec describes. Now I need to shift focus and check whether the writeApp.md directives are being followed in the actual component implementation.\n\nLooking at the directive checklist: I need to verify npm run check is being used, that test spec requirements map to actual code, visual elements match the mockup, interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes, the netlify.toml config is set correctly for the monorepo, the neon driver uses tagged template literals, database columns handle null conversions appropriately, Netlify Functions follow the correct path indexing, modals use searchable dropdowns instead of plain text inputs for entity references, and navigation elements follow specific patterns.\n\nNow checking MaterialDetailPage.tsx against these requirements: the root element has the correct padding classes, interactive elements include testids, the category and account dropdowns use the custom FilterSelect component rather than native select elements, and the modal for editing materials is properly configured.\n\nI'm noticing that the Edit Material and Create Batch modals are rendered inline within the page component itself rather than being abstracted into separate component files. Let me verify whether this violates the writeApp.md guidelines about JSX abstraction.\n\nActually, I need to focus specifically on the Directives section of writeApp.md rather than the Guidelines section. Looking at the three directives: the first is about running npm check from the app directory, the second requires checking components against their test entries, and the third is about matching visual appearance to the mockup. Let me examine each directive to see if there are actual code violations.\n\nFor the visual appearance directive, I can't fully verify without seeing the mockup. But for the data-testid directive, I'm systematically checking each component to ensure interactive elements, containers, and list items have the required test IDs. Starting with MaterialHeader.tsx, I can see it has test IDs on the container, material name, meta information, description, and action buttons.\n\nNow I'm moving through AccountsDistributionTable.tsx, verifying that the section container, empty state, table itself, and individual account rows all have appropriate test IDs with dynamic identifiers where needed. I'm noticing a React fragment issue—the `<>` wrapper in the map doesn't have a key, though the `<tr>` elements inside do have keys. This will trigger a React warning since fragments in lists should be keyed, so I should refactor this to use a proper keyed container instead.\n\nNow I'm checking the test IDs across AllBatchesTable.tsx to verify all the required data attributes are in place for the section, empty state, table, and individual batch rows. Continuing through the TransactionsHistoryTable component, I'm verifying test IDs for each transaction row including the date, transaction ID link, accounts, batch references, quantity fields, and the filter controls for transaction type and date.\n\nNow moving to the MaterialDetailPage modals, I'm checking that the edit material modal and all its internal elements have proper test IDs—the overlay, close button, name input field with error messaging, and the category dropdown with its error state. Continuing through the create batch modal test IDs, covering the material input, account dropdown via FilterSelect, quantity and location fields, lot number, expiration date, and cancel button.\n\nNow I'm checking the backend directives—the monorepo base path and neon driver requirements don't apply to this component layer. Looking at the actual fetch calls in MaterialDetailPage, the client-side POST requests to the netlify functions are straightforward and don't involve the neon driver directly, so those are fine as-is.\n\nFor the database column handling, I can see the expiration_date is already correctly converting empty strings to null. The modals are using FilterSelect for searchable dropdowns on both the category and account fields, which follows the pattern. All the filter controls throughout are using the FilterSelect component rather than native HTML selects, so that's consistent.\n\nThe page has the proper padding applied with the responsive breakpoint for smaller screens. Now I'm checking whether the test entries actually match what the components require—specifically looking at MaterialHeader and what fields it expects. The edit modal properly pre-fills all fields and validates name, category, and unit before saving, with the ability to discard changes by canceling. The NewBatchButton similarly displays with primary styling, opens a modal pre-filled with the material name as read-only, handles batch creation via POST request, and validates account and quantity fields.\n\nNow I'm checking the TransactionButton to ensure it displays with primary styling and correctly navigates to the new transaction page with the material ID as a query parameter. The AccountsDistributionTable needs to render the section heading, column headers for account details and batch counts, display account rows with data, include clickable View Account links, support expanding and collapsing nested batch tables with a chevron, make batch IDs clickable, and handle the empty state when there are no accounts.\n\nFor AllBatchesTable, I'm verifying the section heading, column headers for batch information and actions, batch row data, clickable View Lineage links and batch IDs, filtering capabilities by account and date range, and empty state handling. TransactionsHistoryTable similarly needs the section heading, proper column headers showing transaction details and batch references, transaction rows with arrow notation between accounts, clickable transaction and batch IDs, and filters for transaction type and date.\n\nNow I'm checking the transactions are in reverse chronological order and empty states are handled properly. Looking at the writeApp.md directives, I don't see any violations in the MaterialDetailPage components themselves. The Edit Material and Create Batch modals are defined inline rather than as separate components, but that's listed as a guideline rather than a directive, so it shouldn't be flagged as a violation based on the task requirements. Looking at the component structure in the test spec versus the actual implementation, I see that `EditMaterialButton` and `NewBatchButton` are listed as separate components but they're actually rendered inline as modals within MaterialDetailPage.tsx. This matches the pattern established in previous commits where inline modals were extracted into their own files, so it's being treated as a violation in this codebase even though it's technically a Guidelines issue rather than a Directives one. I need to focus specifically on the Directives section of writeApp.md since that's what the task asks for, separate from the Guidelines. But I'm noticing a real inconsistency here—the test spec expects `EditMaterialButton` and `NewBatchButton` as separate components, yet they're implemented inline within `MaterialDetailPage.tsx` with their modals embedded there. This mismatch between what tests.md specifies and what's actually in the code suggests the implementation doesn't match the intended architecture, which would be a violation if writeApp.md has directives about component structure.\n\nMoving to subtask 3, there are no dedicated test files for MaterialDetailPage at all—just `dashboard.spec.ts` and `deployment.spec.ts`. Since the tests don't exist yet, I can't really check for writeTests.md directive violations; this is more of a missing test suite issue than a violation of how tests should be written.\n\nNow I'm compiling the violations I've found so far: testSpec.md looks clean, but writeApp.md has issues with the Edit Material and Create Batch modals being defined inline in MaterialDetailPage.tsx instead of as separate components.\n\nSince the guidelines require all JSX to be abstracted into separate component files, and I've seen this pattern fixed before in a previous commit, I should add a fix task for extracting these modals rather than fixing them directly.\n\nLooking at the test spec more carefully, I notice it doesn't specify which file each component belongs to like other pages do, but that's not a directive violation. Let me also check if there's a React Fragment key issue in the AccountsDistributionTable where fragments are being mapped over without proper keys.\n\nActually, I'm noticing a potential problem with the test spec entry about clearing the Category selection—if Category is a FilterSelect dropdown, I need to verify whether that's actually a clearable action.\n\nLooking at the validation logic, it checks `if (!editCategoryId)`, which means the category needs to be unset for the validation to trigger. But if the modal pre-fills the category and FilterSelect doesn't expose a clear option, this test scenario might not be implementable as written.\n\nSo my final findings are: no testSpec.md violations, one writeApp.md violation about extracting the inline modals into separate component files, and no test file exists to review against writeTests.md.\n\nActually, I should reconsider this more carefully. The previous fix commit for AccountDetailPage treated inline modals as a writeApp.md violation, so I should apply the same standard here. Plus, the test spec lists \"EditMaterialButton\" and \"NewBatchButton\" as components, which implies the modals they trigger should also be separate files. This looks like a testSpec.md and writeApp.md alignment issue that needs flagging.\n\nI've got enough clarity now to move forward with the
