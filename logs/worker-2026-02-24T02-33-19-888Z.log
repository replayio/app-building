Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

The error says `\"param is missing or the value is empty: context\"`. Looking at the PATCH request body (line 277-280), it uses `context: 'all'` but Netlify might require a different format. Let me check the Netlify API docs.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the error: it seems the PATCH endpoint requires individual `context` values rather than `\"all\"`. The POST creates with `context: 'all'` which might work, but the PATCH updates existing vars and maybe has a different format.\n\nWait, the error happens at line 286, which is from the PATCH fallback. \n\nBoth the POST and PATCH are failing, which suggests the issue is with how I'm formatting the context parameter. The Netlify API might expect a different structure for the PATCH endpoint than what I'm currently sending—possibly individual context entries instead of the `values` array format, or maybe I need to use PUT instead. I think the issue is that PATCH expects a different body format than what I'm sending. Instead of the full values array, it should just be the value and context directly. Let me try using PUT to set the value for a specific context instead, or switch to DELETE followed by POST to recreate the variable. I'll take the simpler route and delete the existing variable first, then create it fresh to avoid dealing with the PATCH formatting
