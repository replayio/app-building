[2026-02-26T06:39:24.151Z] Running task: 2 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md)
[2026-02-26T06:39:24.151Z]   - FixViolationTypeLabels: Fix account type labels to match mockup - typeLabel returns Stock/Input/Output but mockup shows Inventory Account for stock accounts. Update typeLabel in AccountHeader.tsx and AccountDetailPage.tsx to match AppSpec types (inventory/consumer/producer/custom), fix inconsistent test entries in tests.md (line 537 says Inventory Account but line 550 says Stock), and deduplicate the typeLabel function into a shared utility
[2026-02-26T06:39:24.151Z]   - RunTests: Verify tests pass after type label fix

The app is tracking the inventory held of a variety of categorized materials and is broadly similar to an accounting platform.  There is a global set of accounts (inventory, consumer, producer) which can be customized, and within each account there are a variety of materials and their quantity (in customizable units).  Each account / material can be further subdivided into batches where the amount of material in each batch is tracked separately.  Transactions can be recorded and use a double entry system where credits / debits must balance.  Transactions can either reuse batches or create new ones.  newly created batches remember the lineage of batches they were created from.\n     3→\n     4→Pages:\n     5→\n     6→1.

The app is tracking the inventory held of a variety of categorized materials and is broadly similar to an accounting platform.  There is a global set of accounts (inventory, consumer, producer) which can be customized, and within each account there are a variety of materials and their quantity (in customizable units).  Each account / material can be further subdivided into batches where the amount of material in each batch is tracked separately.  Transactions can be recorded and use a double entry system where credits / debits must balance.  Transactions can either reuse batches or create new ones.  newly created batches remember the lineage of batches they were created from.\n\nPages:\n\n1. DashboardPage (/)\n   Description: Main overview page of the inventory and batch management system.

Let me analyze:\n\n1. **AppSpec.md** says account categories are: \"inventory, consumer, producer\" (and custom). The initial prompt says: \"There is a global set of accounts (inventory, consumer, producer) which can be customized\"\n\n2. **AccountsPage description** says: \"Categories for accounts are stock, input, output\"\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy in the AppSpec itself. The initial prompt uses \"inventory, consumer, producer\" but the AccountsPage description uses \"stock, input, output\". The AccountDetailPage description says \"inventory, consumer, producer, or custom\".\n \nLooking at the actual database, the stored values are `stock`, `input`, and `output`, but the `typeLabel` function currently displays them as \"Stock\", \"Input\", \"Output\". The subtask is asking me to update this function so it maps to the AppSpec terminology instead—so `stock` becomes \"Inventory Account\", `input` becomes \"Consumer Account\", and `output` becomes \"Producer Account\". I need to make sure this aligns with what the AppSpec actually specifies.\n\nNow I'm noticing there's inconsistency across the tests and documentation. The tests expect \"Inventory Account\" in some places but \"Stock\" in others, and the AppSpec descriptions themselves seem to use different terminology depending on which page they're describing. I need to figure out which labels are actually correct according to the AppSpec before making the fix. I need to clarify what the actual test inconsistencies are by looking at the specific lines in tests.md. The subtask is asking me to update the typeLabel function to return \"Inventory Account\", \"Consumer Account\", and \"Producer Account\" instead of \"Stock\", \"Input\", \"Output\", then fix the test entries that don't match this naming, and finally extract the typeLabel logic into a shared utility function to avoid duplication across AccountHeader and AccountDetailPage.","signature":"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

[2026-02-26T06:41:29.214Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_017cWtXbmTo4YYvMNQHtYtyn","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the inconsistency clearly:\n- Line 537: `type \"Inventory Account\"` - on AccountDetailPage header\n- Line 550-554: Uses `type \"Stock\"`, `type \"Input\"`, `type \"Output\"` - on AccountDetailPage header\n- Line 586: `Account Type field shows \"Inventory Account\"` - in edit modal\n\nThe test at line 537 says the stock account \"Finished Goods Warehouse 2\" has type \"Inventory Account\", while at line 552 a stock account \"Main Inventory\" has type \"Stock\". These are inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the AppSpec:\n\n\n- Initial prompt: \"global set of accounts (inventory, consumer, producer)\"\n- AccountDetailPage description: \"Detail view for a specific account (inventory, consumer, producer, or custom)\"\n- AccountsPage description: \"Categories for accounts are stock, input, output\"\n\nSo the AppSpec itself has this mapping:\n- stock = inventory\n- input = consumer  \n- output = producer\n\nFor the AccountDetailPage, the type label should use the AppSpec terms: \"Inventory Account\", \"Consumer Account\", \"Producer Account\". But on the AccountsPage, the section headers are \"Stock Accounts\", \"Input Accounts\", \"Output Accounts\" — and the Account Type column values need to match what's shown on the detail page, which means they should display the mapped terminology rather than the internal category names.\n\nThe subtask is specifically about updating typeLabel in AccountHeader, so I need to change it to return the AppSpec-mapped values. But I should check whether this affects the AccountsPage display too — if typeLabel is used there, changing it globally would shift those labels from \"Stock\" to \"Inventory Account\" and so on. I also need to update the tests.md inconsistency around line 550 and consider whether to extract typeLabel into a shared utility to avoid duplication. So the key changes are updating the typeLabel functions in AccountHeader.tsx and EditAccountModal.tsx to display \"Inventory Account\", \"Consumer Account\", and \"Producer Account\" instead of the current labels, which aligns with the AppSpec and the detail page mockup. I should leave AccountsPage.tsx as-is since it uses different category names intentionally for that context, and I'm not sure if AccountsDistributionTable.tsx needs updating since the subtask doesn't explicitly mention it. \"Stock\", \"Input\", \"Output\" makes sense because the section headings are \"Stock Accounts\", \"Input Accounts\", \"Output Accounts\". For AccountDetailPage, I need \"Inventory Account\", \"Consumer Account\", \"Producer Account\" instead. The shared utility would handle the AppSpec-based labels since AccountsPage and AccountDetailPage need different label sets. Looking at the existing AccountsPage tests, they all expect \"Stock\", \"Input\", \"Output\" in the Account Type column, which the subtask doesn't ask to change. For AccountDetailPage, I need to check what the tests expect.\n\nI'm seeing inconsistencies in the test expectations—lines 537 and 586 expect \"Inventory Account\", but line 552 still says \"Stock\". I need to update the tests to consistently use \"Inventory Account\", \"Consumer Account\", \"Producer Account\" across AccountDetailPage. For the deduplication, I should create a utility function that maps account_type to the appropriate display label, accounting for the fact that different pages use different terminology.\n\nLooking at the subtask more carefully, it's asking me to update the typeLabel functions used within AccountDetailPage's context—specifically AccountHeader and EditAccountModal—to return the AppSpec labels instead of the current Stock/Input/Output labels. The remaining typeLabel copies can then be consolidated into a shared utility.\n\nSo my approach should be: create a shared `accountTypeLabel` function for the AppSpec-based labels, update AccountHeader and EditAccountModal to use it, and also update AccountsDistributionTable since it displays account types in a similar context. AccountsPage can keep its current Stock/Input/Output labels since that matches its section naming. Then I need to fix the inconsistent test entries in tests.md where line 537 says \"Inventory Account\" but line 550 says \"Stock\".\n\nActually, both those test lines are testing the same AccountHeader component, so they should definitely be consistent—line 550 should change to match line 537's \"Inventory Account\" format. The AccountsPage tests that reference \"Stock\" are fine since that's the correct label for that specific page context, even though it creates a slight UX inconsistency where the same account shows different type labels depending on which page you're viewing.\n\nLet me look at what the tests expect for the edit modals on both pages to see if there's a pattern

Let me plan the changes:\n\n1. **Create a shared utility** for the account type label that maps the database types to the AppSpec display names\n2. **Update AccountHeader.tsx** to use the shared utility\n3. **Update EditAccountModal.tsx** to use the shared utility\n4. **Update AccountsDistributionTable.tsx** to use the shared utility (since it also shows account types)\n5. **Fix tests.md** - lines 550-554 should use \"Inventory Account\", \"Consumer Account\", \"Producer Account\" instead of \"Stock\", \"Input\", \"Output\"\n\n\n6. **Leave AccountsPage.tsx** alone - it has its own `typeLabel` function that returns \"Stock\", \"Input\", \"Output\" for section headers and context\n\nActually, I need to reconsider. The AccountsPage also has an inline edit modal that shows the Account Type field, and the test expects it to display \"Input\" as read-only. But if I'm creating a shared utility that returns \"Consumer Account\" instead, this will break that test. Let me trace through which modal is being used where and what the actual requirements are.\n\nThe AccountsPage has its own inline edit modal separate from the EditAccountModal component used on AccountDetailPage. The AccountsPage's modal uses its own typeLabel function that returns \"Stock\"/\"Input\"/\"Output\", while the EditAccountModal needs to return the full account type names like \"Inventory Account\". So I need to update the EditAccountModal's typeLabel to return the proper account type labels instead of the abbreviated versions.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, there are multiple copies of typeLabel scattered across AccountHeader, EditAccountModal, AccountsDistributionTable, and AccountsPage—all with the same Stock/Input/Output implementation. The task asks me to deduplicate these into a shared utility, so I should consolidate them into one place rather than maintaining four separate copies.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1780,"cache_read_input_tokens":55715,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1780,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"globa

The AccountsDistributionTable test at line 1275 says Account Type \"Storage\" and \"Manufacturing\" - these are custom types, not the standard stock/input/output types. So the distribution table doesn't specifically test stock/input/output labels, meaning we don't need to worry about changing those tests.\n\nNow let me finalize my plan:\n\n**Changes needed:**\n\n1. **Create shared utility** `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/src/utils/accountTypeLabel.ts`:\n   - A function that maps `stock` → `\"Inventory Account\"`, `input` → `\"Consumer Account\"`, `output` → `\"Producer Account\"`, and defaults to capitalized string for custom types\n\n\n2. **Update AccountHeader.tsx**, **EditAccountModal.tsx**, and **AccountsDistributionTable.tsx**: Each needs to import and use this shared utility instead of their local typeLabel implementations\n3. **Fix tests.md** lines 550-554: Replace the old type labels with the new standardized ones\n\nBut I'm noticing something odd with the AccountsDistributionTable test—it references account types like \"Storage\" and \"Manufacturing\" that don't match the standard stock/input/output categories defined in the TypeScript types. These might be custom account types, or the test data is just using different names. The typeLabel function has a default case that capitalizes any string, so it would handle these custom values, but I need to understand whether these are actually valid account types or test artifacts.\n\nThe subtask specifically mentions updating typeLabel in AccountHeader.tsx and AccountDetailPage.tsx, so I should focus on those files first and make sure they're consistent with the stock/input/output mapping.\n\nSince AccountsPage already displays \"Stock\", \"Input\", \"Output\" correctly and the tests expect that behavior, I'll keep its typeLabel separate rather than changing it. The shared utility function will handle the conversion for AccountHeader, EditAccountModal, and AccountsDistributionTable, while AccountsPage maintains its own implementation.\n\nNow I need to figure out where to create the utils directory for this shared

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions.
