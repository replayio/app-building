This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel.

Let me analyze:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientsList - Check testSpec.md directive violations in ClientsListPage test entries\n\nLooking at the test spec (`docs/tests.md`), the ClientsListPage section at line 95 is:\n```\n## ClientsListPage (/clients)\n```\n\nThat's it - just a header with no test entries! This is clearly a violation of the testSpec.md directives. The AppSpec.md describes ClientsListPage as having:\n- Tabular or card-based layout with key summary fields: client name, type, current status, tags, primary contact, count of open deals, next task\n\n\n- Search, filtering (by status, tags, source, etc.), and sorting controls\n- Action to open detailed Client page\n- Buttons to add a new client and import/export client data\n- Pagination or infinite scrolling\n- A mockup image\n\nThe testSpec.md directives require systematically inventorying every visible element in each mockup and writing test entries for each one, with exact navigation targets or action results for clickable elements. The test spec is essentially empty for ClientsListPage - there are no test entries at all, which is a major violation.\n\nI need to identify these violations and add fix groups rather than fixing them immediately, per the strategy. The ClientsListPage component itself is just a stub with only a heading, which also violates the writeApp.md directives. I should check systematically for test files and inventory what's missing - the test spec has no entries for any interactive elements, navigation targets, filtering, sorting, search functionality, the add new client button, or import/export actions.\n\nThe component stub doesn't match the mockup and lacks the required data-testid attributes on interactive elements, but since there are no test entries defined yet, there's a circular dependency where the component can't be properly implemented without the test spec being filled in first. There are also no Playwright test files specifically for this component.\n\nThe real blocker is that the test spec for ClientsListPage is completely empty, so I need to create fix groups to address the test spec first, then the component implementation, then the tests themselves. The empty test spec is a clear violation of the directive to inventory every visible element and write test entries for each one. I need to add fix groups that will implement the missing test spec, components, and tests for ClientsListPage. Let me check what components already exist and what the mockup shows to understand the full scope of work needed.","signature":"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

Let me systematically go through each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientsList\n\nThe ClientsListPage section in docs/tests.md (line 95) is:\n```\n## ClientsListPage (/clients)\n```\n\nThat's just a header with NO test entries whatsoever. \n\nThe AppSpec.md describes ClientsListPage with the following features:\n- Tabular or card-based layout\n- Key summary fields: client name, type (org/individual), current status (active/inactive/prospect/churned), tags, primary contact, count of open deals, next task\n\n\n- Search functionality, filtering by status/tags/source, sorting controls, and actions to open detailed client pages\n- Buttons to add new clients, import/export capabilities, pagination or infinite scrolling, plus a mockup image\n\nThe testSpec.md directive violations are clear: I need to systematically inventory every visible element in the mockup—every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section—but nothing has been specified at all, and I can't verify whether the mockup's actual elements are being represented accurately.\n\nBeyond that, there are no test entries for clickable elements and their navigation targets, no mutation tests for data changes, no appearance tests for buttons and controls, no modal dialog tests, and no import dialog tests specifying expected data formats. The entire ClientsListPage test spec section is completely empty.\n\nNow I'm looking at the ClientsListPage component itself, which is currently just a minimal stub.\n\nDefining the component structure... Looking at the test file situation, there are only scattered references to ClientsListPage in navigation and deployment tests, but no dedicated test suite for it. Since the test specification itself is empty, there's nothing to write tests against—the real blocker is establishing what ClientsListPage should actually do. I need to start by writing out the test spec, then build the components to match it, and finally implement the actual tests. to add separate build groups for the test spec, components, and tests rather than trying to fit everything into a single fix group—that way each piece can be built with its appropriate strategy.\n\nLet me check the clientsSlice.ts file to see what Redux state structure

No clients backend function exists. The Redux slice references `/.netlify/functions/clients` but the function doesn't exist yet.\n\nNow I have a complete picture. Let me systematically go through each checking job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientsList\n\n**Checking:** ClientsListPage section in docs/tests.md (line 95)\n\nThe section is completely empty - just a header:\n```\n## ClientsListPage (/clients)\n```\n\nThe AppSpec.md describes ClientsListPage with many features that need test entries.\n\n**testSpec.md directive violations found:**\n\n\nThe test spec is missing entries for every UI element and interaction on the page—no tests for individual columns, filters, buttons, or badges. There are no tests documenting what happens when users click navigation elements or perform data mutations like adding or importing clients. The section violates multiple requirements around comprehensive element inventory and action verification.\n\nNow checking the actual component implementation, and I'm finding that ClientsListPage is just a stub with a heading—it's missing the entire table structure, search functionality, filters, sorting, and pagination that the AppSpec requires. The component also lacks the section-level abstraction that should break the page into smaller, reusable components.\n\nThere's no corresponding Netlify backend function for fetching clients data, even though the Redux slice is trying to reference it. And since there are no interactive elements at all, there are naturally no data-testid attributes either. The padding on the root div is correct, but that's the only thing that passes.\n\nLooking at the test side, there's no Playwright test file for this page at all. All three checks point to the same issue: ClientsListPage hasn't actually been built yet—it's just a placeholder. The fix needs to add actual build jobs to implement the component properly.\n\nI need to think about the right approach here. The test spec should come first, then the component implementation, then the tests themselves, so they run in sequence. Looking back at the strategy, I should use `add-group` with the appropriate build strategies rather than treating this as directive violations. I'll need three separate groups: one to write the test spec, one to build the components, and one to write the tests. I'm going back and forth on the right approach here. The checkDirectives strategy is designed for fixing violations, but what I really need to do first is establish the test entries using testSpec, then validate the components against those. But that's probably overcomplicating things—the checkDirectives strategy already covers what needs to happen: fix the code and documentation, update the tests and playwright tests accordingly. Let me just follow that pattern.\n\nSince the entire page needs to be built from scratch, I'll organize this into sequential fix groups: first write the test spec entries for ClientsListPage, then build the actual components with all their features, then write the Playwright tests. Each one depends on the previous, so they need to be separate groups. I should use the build strategies for each task since they have the right instructions—testSpec.md for writing test entries, the component building strategy for the page itself, and the test strategy for Playwright tests.\n\nLooking at what each strategy expects for job naming, I need to follow their specific patterns so the unpacking works correctly.\n\nThe right move is to start with a testSpec group to define what components and test entries ClientsListPage needs, then the component building and test writing can follow in sequence. I'm realizing I don't actually know the exact components yet, so I should plan those out first before committing to specific job names. looking at the AppSpec, I need to break down the ClientsListPage into smaller components like a table or card listing, filters and search controls, and modals for adding or importing clients. For the fix groups, I should use the checkDirectives strategy to ensure the implementation updates tests and documentation alongside the code changes.\n\nRather than trying to build everything at once, I'll create separate fix groups: one for the test spec violations, another for the component and backend implementation, and a third for the Playwright tests. This way future workers can tackle each piece independently without being overwhelmed by the scope. I need to think through the order carefully—when I add groups to the front of the queue sequentially, each new addition pushes the previous one back, so I should add them in reverse order of execution to get the right sequence.\n\nUsing `--trailing` would be simpler and makes more sense strategically: let all the existing checks complete first, then run the fixes for ClientsListPage afterward. Though there's a tension here—ideally the fixes should happen before we check that same area again, but that depends on where ClientsListPage falls in the overall check sequence.\n\nI'm realizing the strategies themselves have unpacking patterns, so adding a single job will cascade into multiple jobs. Rather than trying to predict the exact components, I should create higher-level jobs that let the strategies unpack them naturally—something like asking the testSpec strategy to read the mockup and plan out the test entries for ClientsListPage, then letting the writeApp and writeTests strategies handle their respective pieces based on what components get identified. come from the test spec\n\nFor writeTests, I could add:\n- This depends on having test entries\n\nSo the dependencies are clear: testSpec first, then writeApp, then writeTests.\n\nLet me just add the testSpec group first, and then add a follow-up checkDirectives group to re-check. Actually, this could lead to infinite loops.\n\nOK, let me just be practical. I'll add:\n\n1. A testSpec group to plan and write test entries for ClientsListPage components\n2. A writeApp group to build the ClientsListPage\n3. A writeTests group to write tests for ClientsListPage\n\nFor the testSpec group, I'll include PlanPage and PlanComponent jobs.\nFor the writeApp group, I'll include Write jobs.\nFor the writeTests group, I'll include WriteTest jobs.\n\nBut I don't know the component names yet. Let me start with a PlanPage job that reads the mockup and figures out what components are needed, then I can add PlanComponent jobs for each one. After the test entries are written, I'll add the writeApp group, and once the components are defined, I'll add the writeTests group. The challenge is that I need the component names before I can set up the later groups, so I'll need to handle this sequentially.\n\nI think the best approach is to add the testSpec group with a PlanPage job first, then once that's done, add the other groups based on what components are identified.\n\nI'm going to start by adding the testSpec group with a PlanPage job that will read the
