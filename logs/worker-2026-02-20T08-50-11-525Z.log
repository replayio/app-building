Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values.

Let me focus on TaskDetailPage (section 7) specifically. I need to:\n\n1. **Job 1 (CheckTestSpecTaskDetailPage)**: Check testSpec.md directives against TaskDetailPage test entries in tests.md\n2. **Job 2 (CheckComponentsTaskDetailPage)**: Check writeApp.md directives against TaskDetailPage components\n3. **Job 3 (CheckTestsTaskDetailPage)**: Check writeTests.md directives against TaskDetailPage tests\n\nLet me start with Job 1 - checking testSpec.md directives against TaskDetailPage test entries.\n\n\nLooking at the TaskDetailPage section, I can see it has TaskDetailHeader and TaskNotesSection components with test entries ranging from TDP-HDR-01 through TDP-HDR-04 and TDP-NTS-01 through TDP-NTS-03. Now I'm reviewing the testSpec.md directives to see how they apply here - the key guidance is to prioritize consistent styling and navigation across pages, then systematically document every visible element in the mockups including column headers, filters, buttons, icons, badges, and sections with individual test entries for each.\n\nThe directives also emphasize not substituting easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup actually shows, ensuring every clickable element specifies its exact navigation target or action result, and verifying that data-mutating actions persist correctly with appropriate side effects. I need to check that button appearances are tested, modal dialogs work properly, attachment and import functionality are fully specified with expected data formats, and state-changing actions trigger updates across the app. Looking at the existing TaskDetailPage entries, TDP-HDR-01 covers the task title, priority badge, status, due date, assignee, and client/deal names, which is good, but I should continue evaluating the remaining entries against these criteria. I'm noticing the description field isn't explicitly covered in the existing test cases even though it's part of the component definition, so I need to add a test for that. Let me also verify the notes section is fully tested before finalizing the checklist.\n\nLooking at the navigation requirements, I see that while the back button, mark complete, and cancel task actions are all accounted for, there's a gap—the client and deal links are described as clickable in the component but there's no test verifying they actually navigate to their respective detail pages, which seems like an oversight I should flag.\n\nFor data mutations, I'm noticing the persistence verification is inconsistent across the tests. Mark Complete shows the completed date but doesn't explicitly verify it persists or that timeline entries are created on related pages. Similarly, adding and deleting notes don't mention persistence checks, even though those changes should be saved to the database.\n\nI'm also realizing the button appearance isn't described—Mark Complete and Cancel Task buttons lack details about their styling. And there's a gap where completing a task on TaskDetailPage itself isn't tested for cross-page effects, even though the same action on DealDetailPage creates timeline entries that reflect elsewhere.\n\nLooking back at the core directives, I'm seeing three main gaps: the description field exists but isn't explicitly tested, the client and deal links are clickable but navigation targets

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecTaskDetailPage — testSpec.md Directives vs TaskDetailPage Test Entries\n\nThe TaskDetailPage section (section 7 in tests.md) has:\n- Components: TaskDetailHeader (back button, task title with priority badge, description, due date, assignee, client/deal links, status badge, Mark Complete and Cancel Task buttons), TaskNotesSection (notes list with add note form, delete note button per note)\n- Test entries: TDP-HDR-01 through TDP-HDR-04, TDP-NTS-01 through TDP-NTS-03\n\n\n- The testSpec.md directive requires inventorying every visible element and writing a test for each one. Looking at TaskDetailHeader, I notice the description is listed as a component element but TDP-HDR-01 doesn't explicitly mention testing it—it covers title, priority badge, status, due date, assignee, and client/deal names, but the description field appears to be missing from the test coverage.\n\n- The client/deal links are described as clickable \"links\" in the component definition, yet the test only verifies they display as \"names\" without any test entry for the navigation behavior when clicked—this violates the directive requiring exact navigation targets for every clickable element.\n\n- For the Mark Complete action in TDP-HDR-02, the test verifies the status change, button visibility, and completed date display, but it doesn't specify what other side effects should occur or confirm that the change persists correctly in the backend.\n\n- Looking at how other test entries handle persistence, some explicitly mention it (like CLP-HDR-03 with \"page reload still shows it\" and CDP-QA-03 with \"Task is persisted\"), while others like TDP-HDR-02, TDP-NTS-02, and TDP-NTS-03 don't mention persistence verification at all, creating inconsistency in the spec's rigor around data mutation testing.\n\nThe button appearance directive is less applicable here since there's no actual mockup for TaskDetailPage to reference. For state-changing actions like marking a task complete, I need to verify that the change cascades properly—the task should disappear from the TasksListPage's upcoming list and the client timeline should update accordingly. updated. The cross-cutting test DATA-02 partially covers this (\"Completing a task on DealDetailPage reflects on ClientDetailPage and TasksListPage\") but that's for DealDetailPage, not TaskDetailPage. There's no cross-page verification for marking complete from TaskDetailPage. VIOLATION? Actually, the cross-cutting entries are a separate section. The per-page entries don't necessarily need to repeat cross-cutting behavior. Let me be careful here.\n\n6. **\"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\"** — N/A, no mockup.\n\n7. **\"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\"** — The confirm dialogs are tested (Mark Complete and Cancel Task both use confirm dialogs). OK.\n\n8. **\"Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format.\"** — N/A for TaskDetailPage.\n\n9. **\"Backend integrations that the user can configure...\"** — N/A for TaskDetailPage.\n\nNow I'm checking the component description against the actual implementation. The spec says \"client/deal links\" should be clickable, but looking at TaskDetailHeader.tsx, the client and deal names are rendered as plain `<span>` elements rather than actual navigation links. This is a mismatch — either the test spec needs to clarify that these should be clickable, or the component needs to implement them as proper links. The test TDP-HDR-01 should specify the expected interaction behavior here. navigates to their respective detail pages.\n- writeApp violation: The component renders client/deal as plain text instead of clickable links.\n\nSummary of violations found for Job 1:\n\n1. **TDP-HDR-01 missing description**: The component definition mentions \"description\" but TDP-HDR-01 doesn't verify the description is displayed.\n2. **No test entry for client/deal link navigation**: The component description says \"client/deal links\" but there's no test entry for clicking them and navigating to the respective detail pages.\n3. **TDP-HDR-02, TDP-NTS-02, TDP-NTS-03 missing persistence verification**: These data-mutating operations don't verify persistence.\n\n## Job 2: CheckComponentsTaskDetailPage — writeApp.md Directives vs TaskDetailPage Components\n\nNow I'm checking the writeApp directives against the TaskDetailPage implementation. The key requirements are identifying relevant test entries for each component and verifying the app code satisfies them, matching visual appearance to mockups, and ensuring all interactive elements have proper data-testid attributes. I'm seeing that TaskDetailPage and TaskDetailHeader have the necessary test IDs in place, though I need to continue checking the full list of attributes. Now I'm checking the remaining guidelines against the TaskDetailPage implementation — verifying the neon driver uses tagged template literals in the backend function, confirming database columns handle empty strings as null conversions, checking the Netlify Functions path structure, and noting that the page uses confirm dialogs rather than entity-referencing modals, so most of these don't apply here.\n\nI'm spotting a key issue: the client and deal fields are rendered as plain text spans when they should be clickable links based on the test specifications. I also need to verify the priority badge has proper test identifiers.\n\nNow I'm moving into checking the test directives against the actual TaskDetailPage tests, starting with whether navigation targets are verified precisely with URL or content assertions.\n\nLooking at the mark complete action tests, I notice they're verifying the primary effect but missing assertions for side effects like the task disappearing from the list or timeline entries being created—the writeTests directive specifically requires verifying both the action and its side effects.\n\n3. **\"Avoid using getByText() with common words...\"**\n   - The tests use `getByTestId` consistently. ✓ No `getByText()`\n\nNow I need to verify that the test IDs in the test file match what's actually defined in the components, then check the `.toPass()` blocks for any problematic Playwright locator patterns with auto-wait assertions inside retry logic. Looking more carefully at the `.toPass()` blocks, I see they're wrapping assertions that check for text content within specific sections. The pattern uses `getByTestId` to locate the notes section, then verifies the note content appears there with a timeout buffer. This approach should handle the asynchronous rendering properly. I see the real issue now—nesting `expect().toContainText()` inside `.toPass()` creates nested retry logic where the outer block can't interrupt the inner assertion's auto-wait if it times out. The cleaner approach is to use a single atomic assertion with an explicit timeout instead, eliminating the unnecessary wrapper entirely.\n\nThe same problem applies to those `.toPass()` blocks wrapping `toBeVisible()` calls on lines 49-52, 91-94, and 139-142—they risk deadlocking if the element never appears. Using a direct assertion with a timeout parameter would be safer and more aligned with the testing directive.\n\nNow I'm cataloging the actual violations I've found across the test file to determine which ones are worth flagging.\n\nIn the TaskDetailPage tests, I notice the header test doesn't verify that the description field is actually displayed, even though the component definition includes it. There's also no test coverage for clicking the client and deal links to navigate elsewhere, and the mutation tests for marking complete, adding notes, and deleting notes don't explicitly check that changes persist. Meanwhile, in the actual component code, the client and deal names are rendered as plain spans rather than clickable links, which contradicts what the spec says they should be. I'm checking the TaskPriorityBadge component to see if it has the proper test

Let me also check the backend for the task detail GET — it returns task data including client_id and deal_id. The frontend header renders client_name and deal_name as plain spans. They should be links.\n\nAlso, looking at the backend GET /tasks/:taskId, it only fetches `c.name as client_name` and `d.name as deal_name` but NOT `t.client_id` or `t.deal_id` — actually wait, it does `SELECT t.*, ...` so all task columns are included including client_id and deal_id.\n\nBut the frontend TaskDetailHeader component receives a `Task` type and doesn't have access to client_id/deal_id in the rendering... \n\nActually, the task object from the API does include client_id and deal_id since it selects all task columns. The issue is that the component is just rendering client_name and deal_name as plain text instead of converting them to links.

The Task type has `client_id`, `client_name`, `deal_id`, `deal_name`. The TaskDetailHeader component has access to `task.client_id` and `task.deal_id` but renders client/deal names as plain `<span>` elements, not as links.\n\nNow let me compile all findings and systematically report them.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecTaskDetailPage — testSpec.md Directive Violations\n\nChecking each test entry:\n\n**TDP-HDR-01: Task detail page displays task information**\n- Expected: \"Shows task title, priority badge, status (Open/Completed), due date, assignee, and associated client/deal names.\"\n\n\n- Violations:\n  - Directive \"Systematically inventory every visible element\": Description field is in the component but not mentioned in this test entry.\n  - Directive \"For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target\": The component definition says \"client/deal links\" but TDP-HDR-01 says \"client/deal names\" without specifying click behavior.\n\n**TDP-HDR-02: Mark Complete changes task status**\n- Expected: \"Task status changes to 'Completed'. Mark Complete and Cancel Task buttons are hidden. Completed date is shown.\"\n- Violations:\n  - Directive \"For any user action that mutates data, verify persistence\": No verification that the status change persists after page reload.\n\n**TDP-HDR-03: Cancel Task deletes task and redirects**\n- Expected: \"Task is deleted. User is redirected to /tasks list page.\"\n- OK - specifies navigation target.\n\n**TDP-HDR-04: Back button navigates to tasks list**\n- Expected: \"Navigates to /tasks list page.\"\n- OK.\n\n**TDP-NTS-01: Notes section shows empty state**\n- Expected: \"Shows 'No notes yet' message and an add note form.\"\n- OK.\n\n**TDP-NTS-02: Adding a note persists and shows in list**\n- Expected: \"Note appears in the notes list with content, author, and timestamp. Input is cleared.\"\n- Violations:\n  - Directive \"verify that the change is persisted correctly\": No explicit persistence verification after reload.\n\nContinuing through the remaining test cases...\n\n**TDP-NTS-03: Deleting a note removes it from list**\n- Expected: \"Note is removed from the list.\"\n- Violations:\n  - Directive \"verify that the change is persisted correctly\": No explicit persistence verification after reload.\n\nLooking at comparable test entries from other features, the well-written ones explicitly mention persistence—like CDP-QA-03 and CDP-QA-05 both state \"Task is persisted\" or \"Deal is persisted.\" So these note tests are missing that verification step. I should also check whether there's a test case for the client/deal link navigation mentioned in the component definition.\n\nActually, the component spec describes \"client/deal links\" but in the current implementation they're just plain spans. If they're supposed to be links, the test spec needs to specify what clicking them does—that's a testSpec.md directive violation since every clickable element needs its navigation target or action result documented. And checking TaskDetailHeader.tsx, I can see those client and deal names are rendered as plain span elements rather than actual links, which violates the writeApp.md directive about making sure component code satisfies the test entry requirements.\n\nThe rest of the components look good—TaskNotesSection and TaskDetailPage have proper data-testid attributes on interactive elements, no native select elements where they shouldn't be, and the backend tasks.ts file is using the correct tagged template literal syntax for queries.\n\nFor the path indexing in the backend, I'm verifying the URL structure: when the path gets split and filtered, the taskId lands at index 3, the subResource (notes) at index 4, and the noteId at index 5—all correct.\n\nNow I'm checking the DELETE endpoint to see if it needs to create a timeline event when a task is removed. The test spec only requires that the task is deleted and the user is redirected to the tasks list, which the code handles. There's no explicit requirement for a timeline entry on deletion, so that seems fine.\n\nLooking at another potential issue: the component definition mentions \"client/deal links\" as clickable elements, but the test spec just says \"associated client/deal names\" without specifying interactivity, and the actual code renders them as plain spans instead of links. This creates a mismatch between what the component is supposed to do and what it actually does.\n\nNow I'm moving into the test file violations. The tests are using `.toPass()` with auto-waiting assertions like `expect(card).toBeVisible()` inside, which isn't the right pattern for that method.\n\nThe notes test also has gaps—it's supposed to verify content, author, and timestamp appear together, but it's only checking that the content exists and the input clears. And the header test seems incomplete in what it's checking.\n\nLooking at the header display test more carefully, the spec requires showing title, priority badge, status, due date, assignee, and client/deal names, but the actual test only validates title visibility, status text, and that the notes section exists. It's missing explicit checks for priority, due date, assignee, and those relationship fields. There's also the mark complete test that doesn't verify the side effect—it creates a timeline entry on the client according to the backend, but the test doesn't assert that happened. Looking back at the test spec more carefully, TDP-HDR-01 is missing checks for the priority badge, due date, assignee, and client/deal names that the spec explicitly requires. And reconsidering the writeTests directive about side effects — the mark complete action does produce timeline updates in the backend, so the test should verify those happen exactly once, regardless of whether the test spec mentions them. This is a writeTests violation since the directive requires verifying side effects for actions that produce them.\n\nThe real issue is that the test spec entries themselves should document these side effects so the tests follow naturally from the requirements. Let me compile the violations I'm actually going to flag: TDP-HDR-01 is missing several required field checks, there are no test entries for client/deal link navigation even though the component definition mentions those links, and TDP-NTS-02 and TDP-NTS-03 have similar gaps.\n\nOn the implementation side, the client and deal names are rendered as plain text instead of clickable links, which contradicts the component spec. The test assertions also have issues—using `.toPass()` with nested auto-waiting creates flaky patterns that should be direct assertions with explicit timeouts instead. And several tests are incomplete: TDP-HDR-01 doesn't verify the priority badge, due date, assignee, or client/deal names, while TDP-NTS-02 skips the author and timestamp checks.\n\nI'm grouping these into four fix categories: add the missing client/deal link navigation test entry and make those elements actual links in the code, update the test spec to document description fields and persistence requirements, fix the `.toPass()` assertion patterns throughout, and fill in the missing field assertions in the existing tests.\n\nActually, thinking about the root causes here—client/deal links need updates across the spec, component, and tests as one cohesive fix. The test spec entries are underspecified, missing descriptions and persistence language. And the tests themselves don't fully verify what the spec requires. So I should consolidate into three fix groups aligned with those root causes. I'm consolidating the test fixes since items 3 and 4 both address spec mismatches, then keeping the .toPass() refactor separate. A single RunTests at the end should cover everything once the fixes are
