Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

Configure this with:\n   101→  ```ts\n   102→  build: {\n   103→    sourcemap: true,\n   104→    minify: false,\n   105→  },\n   106→  define: {\n   107→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   108→  },\n   109→  ```\n   110→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   111→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   112→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   113→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   114→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   115→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   116→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   117→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   118→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   119→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   120→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   121→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   122→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   123→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   124→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   125→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   126→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   127→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   128→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   129→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   130→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   131→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   132→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   133→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   134→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"832a56e2-0760-40a3-9546-cfd321588562","uuid":"5bbc8e12-517c-479a-8774-ec456c7bdc4c","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}}}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    10→\n    11→2/14/2026: Sidebar navigation contains only Clients, Deals, and Tasks links. Dashboard, Reports, and Settings links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    12→\n    13→2/14/2026: Filter dropdowns on the deals page use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system.\n    14→\n    15→2/16/2026: Deal detail page attachment upload modal now supports both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n    16→\n    17→2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page now supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    18→\n    19→2/16/2026: Task links on client detail page and deal detail page now navigate to /tasks/:taskId (the task detail page) instead of the deal detail page or being non-clickable.\n    20→\n    21→2/16/2026: Added Supabase authentication system. New pages: Login (/login) with email/password and Google OAuth, Register (/register) with name/email/password and Google OAuth, AuthCallback (/auth/callback) for OAuth redirects. All app routes are protected by a RequireAuth guard that redirects unauthenticated users to /login. The sidebar displays the authenticated user's name, avatar, and a sign-out button. All 10 Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware. Timeline events and deal history now attribute actions to the authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n    22→\n    23→2/17/2026: Authentication is now optional. Removed Login and Register pages. Removed RequireAuth route guard — all pages are accessible without authentication. SSO (Google OAuth) now opens in a popup window instead of navigating the current window. The sidebar user area moved to the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated.\n    24→\n    25→2/18/2026: CSV import dialog on the clients page now shows a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Includes a \"Download CSV template\" button that generates a sample CSV file. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n    26→\n    27→2/18/2026: CSV import extended to support deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks in addition to clients. Deals page has Import button with CSV format (Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status) — client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with CSV format (Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee) — client lookup by name. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with CSV format (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) — creates individuals and optionally associates them with clients by name. Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n    28→\n    29→2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. The Settings page has two sections: (1) Import & Export — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV. (2) Webhooks — CRUD for webhook configurations that can send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint. Sidebar navigation now includes Clients, Deals, Tasks, and Settings.\n    30→\n    31→2/19/2026: Webhook modal now includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    32→\n    33→2/20/2026: FilterSelect dropdowns with many options now include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    34→\n    35→2/20/2026: Fixed testSpec directive violations: CDP-HDR-02 now includes name save persistence verification (edit name, save, confirm persisted after reload) per the directive requiring mutation persistence tests. CDP-QA-04 stage dropdown label corrected from 'Proposal' to 'Proposal Sent' to match the actual application UI labels used in AddDealModal and other components.\n    36→\n    37→2/18/2026: Added Team page (UsersListPage at /users) and User Detail page (UserDetailPage at /users/:userId). Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. Added /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint (GET list with stats, GET detail with deals/tasks/activity). Seeded 9 team members. Sidebar now has \"Team\" nav item. Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal now show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    38→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"832a56e2-0760-40a3-9546-cfd321588562","uuid":"ac35efd5-cadd-47aa-87e1-167f96923fbe","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nChanges to the app spec from bug reports and maintenance.\n\n## Revisions\n\n2/14/2026: Attachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.\n\n2/14/2026: Added a TaskDetailPage at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\n2/14/2026: Sidebar navigation contains only Clients, Deals, and Tasks links. Dashboard, Reports, and Settings links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n2/14/2026: Filter dropdowns on the deals page use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system.\n\n2/16/2026: Deal detail page attachment upload modal now supports both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle, matching the client detail page attachment modal pattern.\n\n2/16/2026: Pipeline view on the deals page now supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n2/16/2026: Task links on client detail page and deal detail page now navigate to /tasks/:taskId (the task detail page) instead of the deal detail page or being non-clickable.\n\n2/16/2026: Added Supabase authentication system. New pages: Login (/login) with email/password and Google OAuth, Register (/register) with name/email/password and Google OAuth, AuthCallback (/auth/callback) for OAuth redirects. All app routes are protected by a RequireAuth guard that redirects unauthenticated users to /login. The sidebar displays the authenticated user's name, avatar, and a sign-out button. All 10 Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware. Timeline events and deal history now attribute actions to the authenticated user's name instead of \"System\".\n\n2/17/2026: Authentication is now optional. Removed Login and Register pages. Removed RequireAuth route guard — all pages are accessible without authentication. SSO (Google OAuth) now opens in a popup window instead of navigating the current window. The sidebar user area moved to the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign in with Google\" button when not logged in. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated.\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import dialog on the clients page now shows a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. Includes a \"Download CSV template\" button that generates a sample CSV file. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoint validates types, statuses, and required fields.\n\n2/18/2026: CSV import extended to support deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks in addition to clients. Deals page has Import button with CSV format (Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status) — client lookup by name. Tasks page has Import button with CSV format (Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee) — client lookup by name. Clients page has new \"Import Contacts\" button with CSV format (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) — creates individuals and optionally associates them with clients by name. Shared ImportDialog component extracted for reuse across all entity types.\n\n2/18/2026: Added Settings page at /settings with sidebar navigation link. The Settings page has two sections: (1) Import & Export — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV. (2) Webhooks — CRUD for webhook configurations that can send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation.

Let me also check the AppSpec.md for the original spec images, and look at the test file for UsersListPage.\n\nThe UsersListPage is relatively simple:\n- Header with \"Team Members\" title and Users icon\n- Grid of user cards showing avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count\n- Clicking a card navigates to /users/:userId\n\nNow let me systematically check each testSpec.md directive against the UsersListPage test entries:\n\n### testSpec.md Directives Check:\n\n1. **\"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\"**\n   \n   Checking the existing tests against the visible elements: the header with Users icon and \"Team Members\" title is covered, the user cards grid is present, and individual card elements like avatar, name, email, deal counts, and task counts are all accounted for in the test entries. Card navigation is tested, and I notice the empty state test appears to be incomplete.\n\nThe page is straightforward with no filter controls or extra buttons beyond the cards themselves. The navigation target for card clicks is explicitly specified as the /users/:userId route pattern, which satisfies the requirement for exact navigation targets. Since this is a read-only list page with no data mutations, I don't need to verify any persistence changes. For the button and control styling requirements, I'm checking whether the mockup specifies particular text, icons, or styling that needs to be matched.\n\nLooking at the test entries more closely, there are only two entries listed under the UsersPageHeader component, and I'm noticing the second entry appears to be cut off mid-thought.\n\nActually, examining the structure more carefully, ULP-HDR-02 is testing User Cards functionality—clicking a card to navigate to a user's detail page—but it's grouped under the UsersPageHeader section when it should have its own User Cards component section. The directive requires test entries to be grouped by component and indicate which components they're exercising, so this organizational mismatch needs to be addressed.\n\nLooking at the coverage requirements, ULP-HDR-01 does mention verifying user card content like names, emails, and deal counts, which seems to satisfy the inventory requirement. But I'm noticing the individual card elements—avatar, name, email, active deals count, open tasks count—might need more granular testing to fully comply with the \"write a test entry for each one\" directive.\n\nComparing to other pages like ClientsListPage and DealsListPage, they have dedicated test entries (CLP-TBL-02, DLP-TBL-02) that specifically verify all required fields display correctly in each row. Following that same pattern, there should probably be a ULP-CRD-01 entry that explicitly tests whether each user card displays all its required fields.\n\nBut I'm noticing the real issue here—ULP-HDR-02 is currently grouped under UsersPageHeader when it should actually be under a UserCards section. And looking back at the testSpec directive about systematically inventorying every visible element, I need to make sure I'm being thorough about what's actually being tested versus what's missing.

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecUsersListPage - testSpec.md directive violations\n\nThe UsersListPage test entries in docs/tests.md (lines 1213-1232):\n\n```\n## 9. UsersListPage (/users)\n\n### Components\n- **UsersPageHeader**: \"Team Members\" title with Users icon\n- **User Cards**: Grid of user cards showing avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. Clicking a card navigates to /users/:userId.\n\n### Test Entries\n\n#### UsersPageHeader\n\n**ULP-HDR-01: Users page displays header and team members**\n\n\n```\n\nLooking at the test cases for the UsersPageHeader component, I can see two specific test scenarios: one verifying that the page header displays correctly with the \"Team Members\" title and the users grid shows all the expected card information, and another checking that clicking a user card properly navigates to that user's detail page.\n\nNow I'm systematically going through each visible element on the UsersListPage mockup to ensure comprehensive test coverage. The users icon in the header is mentioned in the component specs but isn't explicitly tested yet, and while ULP-HDR-01 checks for the grid and card data, I should add a dedicated test that verifies each individual field (avatar, name, email, deal count, task count) on a specific card rather than just confirming they exist in general.\n\n```\nI also notice the empty state message isn't tested at all. Looking at the component structure, there's a mismatch between what's listed in the Components section—UsersPageHeader and User Cards—and the test section headers, which only has UsersPageHeader. ULP-HDR-02 actually tests User Cards functionality but it's grouped under the wrong section header, so I need to create a separate \"#### UserCards\" section to properly organize these tests.\n``` I'm identifying the core issue: the User Cards component lacks its own dedicated test section with specific entries that verify card content like avatar, name, email, deal counts, and task counts—this mirrors the pattern used for other components and needs to be added alongside the header tests.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the app code actually satisfies the test requirements. The header test expects a page header with \"Team Members\" title and a users grid displaying cards with names, emails, and counts—all of which are present in the code. The navigation test expects clicking a card to route to the user detail page, which is also implemented. The next step is verifying the visual appearance matches the mockups. I'm verifying the remaining requirements: the neon driver syntax doesn't apply here since this is frontend code, there are no native select elements to worry about, and I need to check the sidebar for duplicate navigation links. The page root padding is fine since it's the page layout itself, not a reusable component.\n\nNow I'm catching an issue with UsersPageHeader—it has `mb-6` margin on its root element, which violates the layout-agnostic principle that says components shouldn't include outer margins or padding. The parent page should control that spacing instead.\n\nLooking at the user card rendering in UsersListPage.tsx, the entire grid is built inline without being abstracted into its own component file, which is another violation of the requirement that all JSX on a page must be in separate React components. The user card JSX spanning about 38 lines is definitely substantial enough to extract into its own component, while the empty state is simple enough to leave inline.
