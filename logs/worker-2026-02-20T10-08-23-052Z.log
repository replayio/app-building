Let me look at what's already responsive and what's not:\n\n**DealDetailPage.tsx** (main page):\n- Already has `max-sm:p-3` for smaller padding on mobile\n- Two-column layout already has `max-md:grid-cols-1` to stack on medium screens\n- ✅ Mostly responsive\n\n**DealDetailHeader.tsx**:\n- Grid already has `max-md:grid-cols-2 max-sm:grid-cols-1` - ✅ Good\n- The header flex layout could be tight on small screens but it's simple title + edit button\n\n\n- The stage selector's flex row with \"Change Stage\" button might overflow on very narrow screens\n\n**StagePipeline.tsx**:\n- Already has `overflow-x-auto` on the container and smaller text/icon sizes for mobile\n- ✅ Well responsive\n\n**DealHistorySection.tsx**:\n- Simple list layout with flex-1 min-w-0\n- ✅\n\n**DealMetricsSection.tsx**:\n- The two-column grid needs to stack on small screens, so I should add `max-sm:grid-cols-1`\n\n**WriteupsSection.tsx**:\n- Card-based layout looks fine\n- ✅\n\n**LinkedTasksSection.tsx**:\n- Simple list layout\n- ✅\n\n**DealAttachmentsSection.tsx**:\n- Already has responsive flex wrapping and margin adjustments\n- ✅\n\n**DealContactsSection.tsx**:\n- The \"View Profile\" button might wrap awkwardly on very narrow screens\n\n**Modals**:\n- Already have responsive handling in place with proper margins and max heights\n- ✅\n\nThe main issues to address are the metrics grid stacking, contact rows wrapping behavior, task items on very small screens, and the stage selector row getting cramped. Looking at the overall page though, it's already fairly responsive—just needs these targeted tweaks.\n\nLet me implement these fixes now.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7190,"cache_read_input_tokens":45481,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7190,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"89e1ad30-c60c-43a1-aaa5-2fed3aa1a371","uuid":"549b2437-c132-48ec-b46f-7f2dac62963d"}
