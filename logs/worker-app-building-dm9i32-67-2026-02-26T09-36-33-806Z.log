No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n    53→  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write app task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a setup task:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --subtask \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --subtask \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings.

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend.

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch.

Let me now systematically check them against the testSpec.md directives. Let me first list all the directives from testSpec.md:\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n\n3. Don't swap in simpler elements just because they're easier to build — if the mockup shows a table with columns that need joins or computed values, I need to test all of them, and if there are four filter controls shown, I should test all four rather than just the straightforward ones.\n4. Every clickable element needs a test that specifies exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers, with no ambiguity about destinations. For buttons that open external flows like OAuth or payments, I need to document how the flow opens and what happens when it completes.\n5. For any action that changes data, I need to write test entries that verify the mutation happens correctly.\n6. Button appearance matters too — if the mockup specifies particular text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that exact appearance, not just that a button exists.\n7. Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they work as intended.\n8. File uploads should be supported in attachment functionality unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs need to specify the expected data format upfront, and tests should verify that format documentation is visible to users before they try importing.\n10. Any backend integrations the user can configure — webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps — need complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n11. State-changing actions require test coverage.\n\nNow I need to verify that when these actions happen, the rest of the app responds correctly — the timeline captures every mutation it tracks, and any symmetrical relationships automatically update both sides when one side changes.\n\nLet me go through the PersonDetailPage test entries one by one and check them against the mockups in AppSpec.md to make sure I'm covering everything.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4037,"cache_read_input_tokens":36614,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4037,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5da7daac-4415-4888-bca9-45a1d88de458","uuid":"a21b4c33-70fc-494e-93ec-bfd27cc586e0"}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5da7daac-4415-4888-bca9-45a1d88de458","uuid":"0598c8c3-47cc-4ef6-8275-862dd52ccd4e","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

[2026-02-26T09:33:20.664Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01L2XYT9287SbcWWjFztmPAF","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear view of the mockup. Let me systematically check the testSpec.md directives against the PersonDetailPage test entries.\n\n**testSpec.md Directives to check:**\n\n1. **Consistent styling/navigation over exact adherence to images** - The mockup shows a sidebar with Dashboard, Clients, People, Opportunities, Reports, Settings. But per AppRevisions.md, the sidebar was updated to Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, Settings. The test entries don't reference the sidebar, which is fine since it's a shared component.\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element** - Let me check the mockup carefully:\n   - Header section with Dr. Anya Sharma's name, title, organization affiliations, and contact details (email, phone, location) are all tested ✓\n   - Associated Clients listed as clickable links ✓\n   - Relationships section starting to appear in the mockup, which I need to verify is covered in the tests Other Individuals\" with icon ✓ (tested)\n   - Graph View / List View tabs ✓ (tested)\n   - Filter button ✓ (tested)\n   - + Add Entry button ✓ (tested)\n   - Relationship entries with name, type, role, org, [Link] ✓ (tested)\n   \n   Contact History section:\n   - Title \"History of Contact\" with icon ✓ (tested)\n   - Filter button ✓ (tested)\n   - + Add Entry button ✓ (tested)\n   - Entries with date/time, type, summary, team member ✓ (tested)\n   - Edit icons ✓ (tested)\n   \n   Associated Clients section:\n   - Title \"Associated Clients\" with icon ✓ (tested)\n   - Client cards with icon, name, status, industry ✓ (tested)\n   - \"View Client Detail Page\" button with external link icon ✓ (tested)\n\nNow I'm verifying that the layout matches the mockup exactly—the contact history entries maintain their column structure with date, type, summary, and team member, while relationships display person name with type in parentheses, role, and org. For every interactive element, I need to confirm the navigation targets: client cards link to the client detail page, relationship links navigate to individual profiles, and the view tabs properly switch between graph and list layouts.\n\nI'm also checking that data mutations persist correctly—adding contact history entries appear in the list, edits save their changes, and relationship creation triggers reciprocal entries while deletion removes both sides. But I'm wondering whether adding a contact history entry also creates a corresponding timeline entry, since the ClientDetailPage has its own timeline section. adding contact history on a person create a timeline entry on the associated client? The spec doesn't explicitly state this for person contact history. Let me think...\n\nActually, looking at the contact history entries test - the test entry at line 814 says \"the modal closes and the new entry appears in the contact history list\" - this is about persistence. It doesn't mention checking for any timeline side effects. But would adding a contact history entry trigger a timeline event on the associated client? That's an app behavior question. The testSpec directive says: \"State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately\" - specifically for timeline/history and reciprocal relationships.\n\nFor relationships, the reciprocal test is there ✓. For contact history mutations, if the app tracks contact events in the consolidated chronological feed alongside tasks and status changes, then adding a contact history entry should create a timeline event on the client. But that would be tested on the ClientDetailPage. The PersonDetailPage tests are focused on what happens within this page itself. If there's a missing cross-page side effect test, that could be a gap worth flagging.\n\nLooking more closely at the directives - they require tests verifying that mutations are persisted and that exactly the right side effects occur. The contact history submission test only checks that it appears in the list, not whether it persists across a page reload or triggers timeline updates elsewhere. The \"appears in the list\" check might be sufficient if the list is pulling from the backend, but it's worth considering whether persistence and cross-page effects are adequately covered. matters:**\n   - Test entries specify icon types (mail icon, phone icon, pin icon, filter icon, plus icon, pencil/edit icon, external link icon, relationship/connection icon, clock/history icon, building/client icon) ✓\n\n7. **Modal dialogs must be completely tested:**\n   - Add relationship modal: mentions fields (searchable dropdown for person, relationship type, organization) ✓ (tested at line 765)\n   - Add contact history modal: mentions fields (date/time, type, summary, team member) ✓ (tested at line 812)\n   - The relationship modal submission isn't explicitly tested as a complete flow—line 785 covers creating a reciprocal relationship but doesn't describe the actual modal submission sequence of filling fields, clicking submit, and seeing the entry appear. For contact history, I can see the modal opens at line 811, submission creates the entry at line 814, editing works at line 838, and changes persist at line 841, but the relationship tests are missing that same level of detail for the modal submission itself.\n\nSo the gap is: the relationship modal needs an explicit test describing the full submission flow, not just the reciprocal side effect. The contact history might also need a timeline side effect test if adding an entry creates a corresponding event on the associated client's timeline, though that could be covered in the ClientDetailPage tests instead. Looking back at the mockup, the relationship entries follow a specific format with the type and role separated by a dash, which the existing tests capture across multiple entries.\n\nI'm noticing a potential gap in the test coverage though. The modal for adding relationships is tested for opening, and there's a test for creating reciprocal entries, but there's no explicit test for the full form submission flow—filling in the fields, submitting, watching the modal close, and seeing the new entry appear in the list. The ContactHistorySection tests both the modal opening and the form submission separately, so the relationship tests should do the same to fully comply with the directive about testing modal dialogs.\n\nNow I'm checking the delete functionality. The mockup shows edit icons on contact history entries but no delete buttons, so those shouldn't be tested. But there's a delete test for relationships even though the mockup doesn't show delete buttons there either—that test was added because of the reciprocal relationship requirement. I need to figure out if that delete test is actually justified or if it's an overreach. I'm realizing the delete functionality for contact history isn't shown in the mockup—only edit icons are visible—so based on the mockup alone, there's no test needed for deletion. But the directives mention that extra features like delete buttons may be necessary for a complete app, so I should verify whether the test requirements actually call for this. Let me refocus on checking the specific directives rather than the broader requirements section.\n\nGoing through the directive checklist: the modal dialogs directive seems to have a gap—the add relationship modal doesn't explicitly test the submit action. And looking more carefully at the test entries, I can see that reciprocal relationships are being tested, like when a new colleague relationship is added, it should appear on both sides of the connection. I'm realizing the relationship creation test might actually be sufficient since it does verify the modal works end-to-end, even if it doesn't explicitly detail each field. But directive 2 is pushing me to check the mockup more systematically—I should inventory every visible UI element and make sure there's a test for each one.\n\nLooking through the mockup more carefully, I see the relationship entries have that dash between type and role, the contact history rows show date, type, summary, team member, and edit icon, and the associated clients section displays cards with icons, names, status, industry, and a view detail button. All of these appear to be covered in the test entries already.\n\nI'm noticing a potential gap though: the test mentions deleting relationships, but the mockup doesn't show a visible delete button on the relationship entries—just a link. I need to figure out whether the deletion mechanism is actually present in the UI or if the test is describing functionality that isn't visually represented. the test spec doesn't need to specify the exact UI mechanism for deletion—it just needs to describe the user action and expected outcome clearly enough to be testable. The directive about clickable elements is about documenting what happens when you click something, not about requiring every action to specify its triggering element.\n\nLooking back at the PersonDetailPage test entries, they actually cover all the key requirements: visible elements, navigation targets, data persistence, modals, icons, reciprocal relationships, and empty states. The add relationship modal is the only borderline case where the test could be more explicit about form submission with specific field values, but overall the spec seems compliant. I'm seeing the asymmetry now—the contact history tests explicitly cover the full modal flow (opening, filling fields, submitting, modal closing, entry appearing), but the relationships tests skip that submission step. The \"Creating a relationship creates reciprocal entry\" test covers the outcome but not the modal interaction itself, which means the directive to completely test modal dialogs isn't fully satisfied for relationships. I should also check whether there are any edit tests for relationship entries, since the mockup only shows [Link] elements without edit icons. The relationship creation test describes the action at a higher level than the contact history test—it confirms the modal was submitted and the result appeared, but doesn't walk through each field being filled in step-by-step like the contact history test does. The directive requires completely testing modal dialogs, so this might be a gap worth noting.\n\nLooking at the mockup format again, I see the relationship displays as \"Name (Type) - Role, Organization [Link]\" with a dash between the type and role, but the test entries break this down into separate components without explicitly mentioning that dash as part of the formatting.\n\nI don't think this rises to a violation since the test describes the content accurately, just not the exact punctuation. However, I do notice the deletion test at line 788 doesn't specify how users actually delete a relationship entry—there's no visible delete button in the mockup, yet the test assumes deletion is possible. That's a real gap: the test needs to specify the exact mechanism (icon, button, menu action) for removing entries, which directive 4 requires for all clickable elements. I think the extra delete functionality might be intentional—the requirements do mention adding necessary features beyond the spec when needed. The clearest gap I'm seeing is the missing test for actually submitting the add relationship form. Let me verify I've covered everything in the mockup by scanning through it once more: the header with Dr. Anya Sharma's name, title, company affiliations, contact details, and associated clients all check out.\n\nThe layout shows email, phone, and location grouped together visually, which differs slightly from how the tests treat them as separate items, but that's just a presentation difference—the content itself is covered. I'm satisfied with the testSpec.md validation now, so I should move forward to checking the directives in writeApp.md and writeTests.md. Actually, I should be more systematic about this and go through every directive explicitly rather than just flagging the ones I think might be problematic.\n\nThe sidebar navigation with Dashboard, Clients, People, Opportunities, Reports, and Settings was updated per AppRevisions.md, and the PersonDetailPage tests handle it separately, so that's fine. I've inventoried all visible elements across the mockups, confirmed that nothing's been substituted for easier alternatives, verified that every clickable element specifies its target, and checked that data mutations like adding relationships are properly tested for persistence and side effects.\n\nFor the modal dialogs, I'm seeing that the add relationship modal opens and the reciprocal creation implicitly covers the submission flow, while the add and edit contact history modals are more explicitly tested. The add relationship modal submission could use more explicit coverage, though it's borderline. Attachment uploads and import dialogs don't apply to this page.\n\nOn state-changing actions, reciprocal relationships are tested, but there's a question about whether adding contact history should verify that timeline events are created on the associated client—though that might belong in the ClientDetailPage tests instead. I'm focusing on what's clearly within PersonDetailPage scope, and I think the main finding is that the add relationship modal's submission flow isn't explicitly tested as a separate case.\n\nActually, wait—looking more carefully, the test at line 785 does test the modal submission when it describes adding a 'Colleague' relationship between the current person and 'Alex Rivera'. Combined with the modal opening test at line 764, these together cover the complete flow. The real issue is that the submission test doesn't explicitly describe which fields were filled in or the modal interaction itself.\n\nComparing to the contact history test at line 814, which spells out filling in the date, type, summary, and team member fields, then clicking submit and seeing the modal close—the relationships test should be similarly explicit about selecting the person dropdown, relationship type, and organization, then clicking submit and confirming the modal closes with the reciprocal entry created. I've identified a gap in the test coverage: the add relationship modal is tested for opening, but there's no explicit test for the complete submission flow—filling fields, clicking submit, the modal closing, and the new entry appearing in the list. The reciprocal entry test covers the side effect but not the modal UX itself, which is inconsistent with how the contact history modal is tested. Let me verify this by checking the actual test entries again.\n\nLooking at the test descriptions, the submission flow is mentioned within the reciprocal entry test rather than as its own dedicated test.

Let me also read the backend functions for individuals.\n\n**writeApp.md Directives to check:**\n\n1. Always run `npm run check` from the app directory - N/A for checking, this is about development process\n2. When working on a component, identify the test entries and make sure requirements are satisfied\n3. Match visual appearance of elements to the mockup\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything E2E tests need to target\n5. In a monorepo, add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` to `netlify.toml` - not specific to PersonDetailPage\n\n\n6. Neon serverless driver requires tagged template literals, and DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns need empty strings converted to null\n7. Netlify Functions use function name at index 2 and resource ID at index 3 in the path\n8. Modals referencing other entities must use searchable select/dropdown instead of plain text input, and filter controls can't use native HTML `<select>` elements\n9. Navigation sidebars shouldn't have duplicate links, and attachments need file-type-specific icons with actual file upload support\n10. Every page component needs consistent styling with `p-6 max-sm:p-3` padding on the root, while child components stay layout-agnostic without their own outer padding or margins\n\nNow I'm verifying the implementation details across PersonDetailPage and PersonHeader—checking that padding is applied correctly at the page level, all interactive elements use proper components instead of native selects, and test IDs are consistently placed on key elements.\n\nLooking at RelationshipsSection, I'm confirming it uses the searchable select component for adding relationships rather than plain text inputs, and checking that all the major UI sections have appropriate test IDs for the tabs, filters, and list items.\n\nNow moving through ContactHistorySection to verify its test coverage on the section itself and the action buttons. AssociatedClientsSection.tsx looks good with comprehensive test IDs and no outer padding.

[2026-02-26T09:35:45.812Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01EUiyTmd6kQZJZKUQua8w3N","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now let me check the writeApp.md directives against all PersonDetailPage components and backend functions.\n\n**Directive 1: Run `npm run check` from app directory** - N/A (process directive, not code check)\n\n**Directive 2: When working on a component, identify test entries and make sure requirements are satisfied** - I'll check if the components satisfy the test entry requirements.\n\n**Directive 3: Match visual appearance to mockup** - Already checked visually, components seem to match.\n\n**Directive 4: All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything E2E tests need to target**\n\n\nI'm verifying that PersonDetailPage, PersonHeader, RelationshipsSection, and ContactHistorySection all have the required data-testid attributes across their interactive elements, tabs, buttons, filters, lists, and form fields.\n\nNow I need to check the backend implementation—specifically whether the database query functions in individuals.ts are using tagged template literals as required, or if they're relying on a wrapper function that might not follow that pattern. The wrapper functions are likely handling the query execution, but I need to verify whether they're using the tagged template syntax internally or just passing through the parameterized approach, which would violate the directive about only using tagged templates with the neon serverless driver. This pattern is consistent across the SalesCRM backend, so understanding how it works is important. I need to focus on the PersonDetailPage components themselves, not the backend functions—those were checked separately. Let me review the remaining directives for the component layer, starting with the modal requirements around searchable selects for entity references. modal uses `<SearchableSelect>` for person selection ✓\n- ContactHistorySection: The add modal uses text inputs for team member field. But \"Team Member\" is a text field, not an entity reference. Looking at the test spec, line 812 says \"team member(s)\" - it's a free-text field. So this is fine. ✓\n\nWait, I need to reconsider this. The team member field in ContactHistorySection is currently a plain text input, but the test data shows actual user names and roles like \"Michael B. (Sales Lead)\" and \"Emily R. (Account Manager)\" - these are clearly entity references, not arbitrary text. The directive is explicit that modals referencing other entities should use searchable selects instead of plain text inputs, so this field should be updated to use a dropdown component that queries the users API. Team members are entities (users). The current implementation uses a plain text input.\n\nHmm, but team members are not really IDs here - they're just display names. The \"performedBy\" field in the backend (contact-history.ts line 97) stores a plain string, not a user ID. So this might not be \"referencing another entity\" in the ID sense.\n\nActually, looking at the AppRevisions.md: \"Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\"\n\nThis was specifically added for deal/task fields. The contact history team member field is a plain text field where you can type \"Michael B. (Sales Lead)\". This is by design since it stores display names, not user IDs. The mock data shows entries like \"Team Member: Michael B. (Sales Lead)\" and \"Team Member: System (Auto-logged)\", so I'll consider this NOT a violation since the team member field stores display names rather than entity references.\n\nMoving through the directives: Navigation sidebars aren't relevant here, and both RelationshipsSection and ContactHistorySection properly use FilterSelect instead of native HTML select elements. Attachment-related directives don't apply to PersonDetailPage.\n\nNow checking the padding and layout directives - PersonDetailPage has the correct `p-6 max-sm:p-3` padding on its root element, and all child sections use semantic class names without inline padding utilities, which keeps them layout-agnostic as required.\n\nI'm also noticing a potential data model mismatch where `source_type` from the clients table is being mapped to `industry` in the individuals function, but the AppSpec describes clients having a more complex Source structure with Type, Detail, Campaign, and Channel fields rather than a simple industry field.\n\nLet me verify I've covered all the directive violations: the npm check process, test entries matching components, visual mockup alignment, data-testid attributes on interactive elements, and the backend's use of Neon tagged template literals. Now I'm verifying that all interactive elements have proper test IDs across the components. PersonHeader has the client link buttons covered, and RelationshipsSection has test IDs for the tabs, filter button, add entry button, and the type filter select, with the relationship link buttons also getting unique identifiers.\n\nContinuing through the modal elements for adding relationships—the person select, type filter, and cancel/submit buttons all have their test IDs assigned. ContactHistorySection follows the same pattern with filter and add entry buttons, type filter select, and edit buttons for individual entries.\n\nNow I'm verifying the edit form fields for contact history entries have their test IDs, along with the cancel and save buttons, then checking the add modal fields and buttons.
