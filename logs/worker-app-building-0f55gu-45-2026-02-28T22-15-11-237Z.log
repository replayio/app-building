For actions that produce side effects, verify both primary effect and side effect; assert side effect happens exactly once\n4. Avoid `getByText()` with common words — prefer `getByTestId`\n5. All `data-testid` values across test files for the same component must be consistent\n6. When test spec describes file upload, exercise actual file upload mechanics\n7. NEVER put auto-wait locator calls inside `.toPass()` retry blocks\n8. No unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach`\n9. Generous timeouts for backend round-trips\n10. `test.slow()` for multi-step flows\n11.

Tests must verify navigation targets precisely (assert URL or page content)\n2. When a test spec entry implies a component across multiple pages, tests must interact on each page — never use `page.goto()` as workaround\n3. For actions that produce side effects, verify both primary effect and side effect; assert side effect happens exactly once\n4. Avoid `getByText()` with common words — prefer `getByTestId`\n5. All `data-testid` values across test files for the same component must be consistent\n6. When test spec describes file upload, exercise actual file upload mechanics\n7. NEVER put auto-wait locator calls inside `.toPass()` retry blocks\n8. No unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach`\n9. Generous timeouts for backend round-trips\n10. `test.slow()` for multi-step flows\n11. Tests must exercise exact fields described in spec entries\n\n### Checking NavigationHeader tests (lines 3-97)\n\n**\"Navigation header displays app branding and all navigation links\"** (line 4):\n- Uses `getByTestId` throughout ✓\n- Generous timeout `{ timeout: 30000 }` ✓\n- Verifies text, order, and all elements ✓\n- No `getByText` with common words ✓\n\n**\"Navigation link for Accounts navigates to AccountsPage\"** (line 33):\n- Verifies URL with `toHaveURL(/\\/accounts$/)` ✓\n- Verifies page content `getByTestId(\"accounts-page\")` visible ✓\n- Navigation target verified precisely ✓\n\n**\"Navigation link for Materials/Batches/Transactions/Settings\"** (lines 43-81):\n- All follow same pattern: click, verify URL, verify page content ✓\n\n**\"Active navigation link is visually highlighted\"** (line 83):\n- Verifies CSS class `navbar-link--active` ✓\n- Verifies both pages (dashboard and accounts) ✓\n- Verifies logo deactivation ✓\n\n### Checking LowInventoryAlerts tests (lines 99-280)\n\n**\"Low inventory alerts section displays with heading and warning icon\"** (line 103):\n- Verifies heading text and icon visibility ✓\n\n**\"Each low inventory alert shows severity, material name, current quantity, and reorder point\"** (line 113):\n- `test.slow()` ✓\n- Iterates rows checking all fields ✓ (not inside `.toPass()` so no auto-wait deadlock risk)\n- Verifies specific severity assignments (Aluminum=Critical, Steel/Copper=Warning) ✓\n\n**\"Low inventory alert View Details link navigates to material detail page\"** (line 174):\n- URL verified precisely with material ID ✓\n- MaterialDetailPage visibility verified ✓\n\n**\"Low inventory alert Dismiss button removes the alert\"** (line 194):\n- Primary effect verified: Copper Wire removed with atomic `toHaveCount(0)` ✓\n- Other alerts remain ✓\n- **VIOLATION**: The test spec entry says \"The dismissal is persisted so the alert does not reappear on page reload (until inventory changes again)\" but the test does NOT verify persistence by reloading the page.

Let me check the test script and try running from the correct directory.\n$ npm run test tests/dashboard.spec.ts 2>&1 | tail -5\n$ cat package.json | grep -A5 '\"test\"'\n    \"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@neondatabase/serverless\": \"^0.10.4\",\n    \"@reduxjs/toolkit\": \"^2.5.0\",\n    \"react\": \"^18.3.1\",\n$ pwd\n/repo/apps/InventoryTracker\n[TaskOutput]\nThe test seems to be timing out during setup.

I need to add `test.slow()` to triple the timeout.

The 6 remaining failures are all pre-existing issues unrelated to my change:\n- 2 cold-start timeouts for NavigationHeader tests (first tests hit Vite cold start)\n- `Materials categories overview updates when category filter is applied` - timeout/browser closed\n- `Recent transactions table shows multiple transactions in reverse chronological order` - timeout/browser closed\n- `Recent transactions table updates when date range filter is applied` - date filter SQL error (pre-existing `$1` syntax error)\n- `Selecting a new date range updates all dashboard widgets` - same date filter issue\n\nThe serial LowInventoryAlerts tests all pass now (tests 14, 17, 19), confirming the dismiss persistence test works correctly with the reload verification.\n[TodoWrite]\nBoth subtasks are complete:\n\n1. **FixViolationDashboardDismissPersistence**: Updated the dismiss alert test at `tests/dashboard.spec.ts:194` to reload the page after dismissing the Copper Wire alert and verify it does not reappear, matching the testSpec.md requirement: \"The dismissal is persisted so the alert does not reappear ... (truncated)\n\n2. **RunTests**: The modified test passes successfully (1.7m with slow timeout).
