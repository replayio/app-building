The Webhooks section is visible.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Add Webhook\" button.\n- **Expected:** The AddEditWebhookModal opens with empty form fields and the title \"Add Webhook\" (or \"Create Webhook\"). The modal contains fields for Name, URL, platform selection, and event checkboxes.\n\n#### Webhook list displays configured webhooks\n- **Initial state:** User is on /settings. One or more webhooks have been configured (e.g., \"Zapier Integration\" pointing to https://hooks.zapier.com/...).\n- **Expected:** The Webhooks section displays a list of configured webhooks. Each webhook entry shows the webhook name (e.g., \"Zapier Integration\"), the URL (or a truncated version), an enable/disable toggle, an edit button, and a delete button.\n\n#### Clicking edit on a webhook opens AddEditWebhookModal in edit mode\n- **Initial state:** User is on /settings. A webhook named \"Zapier Integration\" exists in the list.\n- **Action:** User clicks the edit button on the \"Zapier Integration\" webhook entry.\n- **Expected:** The AddEditWebhookModal opens with all fields pre-populated with the existing webhook data: Name = \"Zapier Integration\", URL = the configured URL, platform selection matching the URL pattern, and the previously selected event checkboxes checked.\n\n#### Enable/disable toggle changes webhook active state\n- **Initial state:** User is on /settings. A webhook named \"Zapier Integration\" exists with the toggle in the enabled (active) state.\n- **Action:** User clicks the enable/disable toggle on the \"Zapier Integration\" webhook entry.\n- **Expected:** The toggle switches to the disabled state. The webhook is updated via the API to be inactive. Disabled webhooks will not fire when events occur. The toggle visually reflects the disabled state. Clicking the toggle again re-enables the webhook.\n\n#### Delete webhook button shows confirmation dialog\n- **Initial state:** User is on /settings. A webhook named \"Zapier Integration\" exists in the list.\n- **Action:** User clicks the delete button on the \"Zapier Integration\" webhook entry.\n- **Expected:** A confirmation dialog appears asking the user to confirm deletion (e.g., \"Are you sure you want to delete this webhook?\"). The dialog has \"Cancel\" and \"Delete\" (or \"Confirm\") buttons.\n\n#### Confirming webhook deletion removes the webhook\n- **Initial state:** The delete confirmation dialog is open for the \"Zapier Integration\" webhook.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Delete\" (or \"Confirm\") button.\n- **Expected:** The webhook is deleted via the API. The webhook entry is removed from the list. If no webhooks remain, the empty state message is shown.\n\n#### Canceling webhook deletion keeps the webhook\n- **Initial state:** The delete confirmation dialog is open for the \"Zapier Integration\" webhook.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The dialog closes. The webhook remains in the list unchanged.\n\n#### Webhook list shows event types for each webhook\n- **Initial state:** User is on /settings. A webhook exists configured to fire on \"New Client Created\" and \"Deal Stage Changed\" events.\n- **Expected:** The webhook entry displays the subscribed event types (e.g., as badges or a comma-separated list showing \"New Client Created\", \"Deal Stage Changed\") so the user can see at a glance what events trigger each webhook.\n\n### AddEditWebhookModal\n\n#### Modal displays name, URL, platform, and event fields\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open (via clicking \"Add Webhook\").\n- **Expected:** The modal contains: a Name text input field, a platform selection control with options for Zapier, n8n, and Custom, a URL text input field, and a set of event checkboxes for subscribing to events (e.g., \"New Client Created\", \"Deal Stage Changed\", \"Task Completed\", etc.). The modal has \"Cancel\" and \"Save\" (or \"Create\") buttons at the bottom.\n\n#### Platform selection shows Zapier setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Zapier\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A platform-specific setup guide is displayed with step-by-step instructions for obtaining the Zapier webhook URL. The guide explains where to find the webhook URL in Zapier (e.g., \"Create a new Zap, add 'Webhooks by Zapier' as the trigger, select 'Catch Hook', and copy the webhook URL\"). A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/...\"). A platform-specific tip is displayed explaining that Zapier needs the first event sent to detect the payload schema. The URL input placeholder updates to reflect the Zapier URL format.\n\n#### Platform selection shows n8n setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"n8n\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A platform-specific setup guide is displayed with step-by-step instructions for obtaining the n8n webhook URL. The guide explains where to find the webhook URL in n8n (e.g., \"Add a Webhook node to your workflow, copy the webhook URL from the node settings\"). A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...\"). A platform-specific tip is displayed explaining that n8n has separate test and production URLs and to use the production URL. The URL input placeholder updates to reflect the n8n URL format.\n\n#### Platform selection shows Custom endpoint setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Custom\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A setup guide is displayed with instructions for configuring a custom webhook endpoint. The guide explains that the endpoint must accept POST requests with a JSON payload. A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://your-server.com/webhook\"). The URL input placeholder updates to a generic webhook URL format.\n\n#### Payload format preview is toggleable\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with a platform selected.\n- **Action:** User clicks a toggle or expandable section to show the payload format preview.\n- **Expected:** A section expands or appears showing the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The preview displays example JSON with fields like event type, timestamp, and entity data. The user can toggle this section closed again to hide the preview.\n\n#### Event checkboxes allow selecting multiple events\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open. No events are selected.\n- **Action:** User checks the \"New Client Created\" and \"Deal Stage Changed\" event checkboxes.\n- **Expected:** Both checkboxes are visually checked. The user can check or uncheck any combination of event types independently. At least one event must be selected to save the webhook.\n\n#### Modal validates required fields\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with all fields empty.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Save\" button without filling in any fields.\n- **Expected:** Validation errors are displayed for required fields: Name is required, URL is required, and at least one event must be selected. The webhook is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### Modal validates URL format\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open. User has entered a name and selected events.\n- **Action:** User enters \"not-a-valid-url\" in the URL field and clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** A validation error is displayed indicating the URL is not valid (e.g., \"Please enter a valid URL\"). The webhook is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### Successfully creating a webhook adds it to the list\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User fills in Name = \"My Zapier Hook\", selects platform = \"Zapier\", enters URL = \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123/abc\", checks \"New Client Created\" and \"Task Completed\" events, and clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** The webhook is created via the CRUD API. The modal closes. The new webhook \"My Zapier Hook\" appears in the webhooks list with the URL displayed, an enabled toggle, and the selected event types shown.\n\n#### Successfully editing a webhook updates the list\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open in edit mode for a webhook named \"My Zapier Hook\" subscribed to \"New Client Created\" and \"Task Completed\".\n- **Action:** User changes the name to \"Updated Zapier Hook\" and additionally checks the \"Deal Stage Changed\" event. User clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** The webhook is updated via the API. The modal closes. The webhook list shows the updated name \"Updated Zapier Hook\" and now displays three subscribed events: \"New Client Created\", \"Task Completed\", and \"Deal Stage Changed\".\n\n#### Cancel button closes modal without saving\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with some fields filled in.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No webhook is created or updated. The webhooks list remains unchanged.\n\n#### Modal closes on overlay click without saving\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the modal overlay (area outside the modal dialog).\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No webhook is created or updated.\n\n#### URL placeholder updates based on selected platform\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with no platform selected.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Zapier\", then \"n8n\", then \"Custom\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** When \"Zapier\" is selected, the URL input placeholder shows a Zapier-style URL hint (e.g., \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/...\"). When \"n8n\" is selected, the placeholder changes to an n8n-style URL hint (e.g., \"https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...\"). When \"Custom\" is selected, the placeholder changes to a generic URL hint (e.g., \"https://your-server.com/webhook\").\n\n## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n\n## UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n\n## ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n\n## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n","numLines":843,"startLine":1,"totalLines":843}}}

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n     8→\n     9→## Task Detail Page\n    10→\n    11→A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification.

Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n\n## Sidebar Navigation\n\nSidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n\n## Filter Dropdowns\n\nFilter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n\n## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n\nPipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n\n## Authentication\n\nAuthentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n\nEmail/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n\nA \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n\nThree auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n\n## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n\nThe Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n\n## CSV Import and Export\n\nCSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n\nCSV formats:\n- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n\nA shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n\n## Settings Page\n\nA Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n\n## Webhook Setup Guides\n\nWebhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n\n## Team Page and User Management\n\nA Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n\nDeal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n\n## Client Following and Email Notifications\n\nAuthenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n\nTwo new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n","numLines":79,"startLine":1,"totalLines":79}}}

From the AppRevisions.md (line 68-72):\n\n> A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count.\n\nAnd from the exploration, the User data structure is:\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: string\n  name: string\n  email: string\n  avatar_url: string | null\n  active_deals_count: number\n  open_tasks_count: number\n  created_at: string\n\n\n}\n```\n\nThe Redux state has:\n```typescript\ninterface UsersState {\n  items: User[]\n  current: User | null\n  loading: boolean\n  error: string | null\n}\n```\n\nComponents: UsersGrid, UserCard\n\nNow I'm ready to write the test entries for UsersListPage following the testSpec.md directives and matching the existing patterns in tests.md. I'll structure the tests for the Team page with sections for UsersGrid and UserCard, starting with the page heading and grid display tests.\n\nFor the UsersGrid tests, I need to verify that the \"Team\" heading appears when navigating to /users with the sidebar link highlighted, and that user cards render in a responsive grid layout that adapts from single column on mobile to multiple columns on larger screens. For UserCard tests, I'm checking that avatars display correctly with fallbacks for missing images, and that user information like names and other details are properly rendered. -square icon (e.g., \"3 open tasks\", \"1 open task\"). The count reflects the current number of tasks in open status assigned to that user.\n\nSelecting a user card should navigate to the detail page for that user at /users/:userId, displaying their full information. While the users list is loading, I need to show a loading indicator in the grid area while keeping the page heading visible. For the empty state, I'm handling the case when there are no users to display. I'm realizing I need to follow the job description more closely—the components are UsersGrid and UserCard, so I should organize the tests accordingly. Looking at how other pages structure their tests, the pattern seems to be that a \"Content\" component handles page-level concerns like headings, loading states, and empty states, while the specific components like cards handle their own display logic.

The dialog has \"Cancel\" and \"Delete\" (or \"Confirm\") buttons.\n\n#### Confirming webhook deletion removes the webhook\n- **Initial state:** The delete confirmation dialog is open for the \"Zapier Integration\" webhook.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Delete\" (or \"Confirm\") button.\n- **Expected:** The webhook is deleted via the API. The webhook entry is removed from the list. If no webhooks remain, the empty state message is shown.\n\n#### Canceling webhook deletion keeps the webhook\n- **Initial state:** The delete confirmation dialog is open for the \"Zapier Integration\" webhook.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The dialog closes. The webhook remains in the list unchanged.\n\n#### Webhook list shows event types for each webhook\n- **Initial state:** User is on /settings. A webhook exists configured to fire on \"New Client Created\" and \"Deal Stage Changed\" events.\n- **Expected:** The webhook entry displays the subscribed event types (e.g., as badges or a comma-separated list showing \"New Client Created\", \"Deal Stage Changed\") so the user can see at a glance what events trigger each webhook.\n\n### AddEditWebhookModal\n\n#### Modal displays name, URL, platform, and event fields\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open (via clicking \"Add Webhook\").\n- **Expected:** The modal contains: a Name text input field, a platform selection control with options for Zapier, n8n, and Custom, a URL text input field, and a set of event checkboxes for subscribing to events (e.g., \"New Client Created\", \"Deal Stage Changed\", \"Task Completed\", etc.). The modal has \"Cancel\" and \"Save\" (or \"Create\") buttons at the bottom.\n\n#### Platform selection shows Zapier setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Zapier\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A platform-specific setup guide is displayed with step-by-step instructions for obtaining the Zapier webhook URL. The guide explains where to find the webhook URL in Zapier (e.g., \"Create a new Zap, add 'Webhooks by Zapier' as the trigger, select 'Catch Hook', and copy the webhook URL\"). A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/...\"). A platform-specific tip is displayed explaining that Zapier needs the first event sent to detect the payload schema. The URL input placeholder updates to reflect the Zapier URL format.\n\n#### Platform selection shows n8n setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"n8n\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A platform-specific setup guide is displayed with step-by-step instructions for obtaining the n8n webhook URL. The guide explains where to find the webhook URL in n8n (e.g., \"Add a Webhook node to your workflow, copy the webhook URL from the node settings\"). A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...\"). A platform-specific tip is displayed explaining that n8n has separate test and production URLs and to use the production URL. The URL input placeholder updates to reflect the n8n URL format.\n\n#### Platform selection shows Custom endpoint setup guide\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Custom\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** A setup guide is displayed with instructions for configuring a custom webhook endpoint. The guide explains that the endpoint must accept POST requests with a JSON payload. A URL format hint is shown (e.g., \"https://your-server.com/webhook\"). The URL input placeholder updates to a generic webhook URL format.\n\n#### Payload format preview is toggleable\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with a platform selected.\n- **Action:** User clicks a toggle or expandable section to show the payload format preview.\n- **Expected:** A section expands or appears showing the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The preview displays example JSON with fields like event type, timestamp, and entity data. The user can toggle this section closed again to hide the preview.\n\n#### Event checkboxes allow selecting multiple events\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open. No events are selected.\n- **Action:** User checks the \"New Client Created\" and \"Deal Stage Changed\" event checkboxes.\n- **Expected:** Both checkboxes are visually checked. The user can check or uncheck any combination of event types independently. At least one event must be selected to save the webhook.\n\n#### Modal validates required fields\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with all fields empty.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Save\" button without filling in any fields.\n- **Expected:** Validation errors are displayed for required fields: Name is required, URL is required, and at least one event must be selected. The webhook is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### Modal validates URL format\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open. User has entered a name and selected events.\n- **Action:** User enters \"not-a-valid-url\" in the URL field and clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** A validation error is displayed indicating the URL is not valid (e.g., \"Please enter a valid URL\"). The webhook is not created. The modal remains open.\n\n#### Successfully creating a webhook adds it to the list\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User fills in Name = \"My Zapier Hook\", selects platform = \"Zapier\", enters URL = \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123/abc\", checks \"New Client Created\" and \"Task Completed\" events, and clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** The webhook is created via the CRUD API. The modal closes. The new webhook \"My Zapier Hook\" appears in the webhooks list with the URL displayed, an enabled toggle, and the selected event types shown.\n\n#### Successfully editing a webhook updates the list\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open in edit mode for a webhook named \"My Zapier Hook\" subscribed to \"New Client Created\" and \"Task Completed\".\n- **Action:** User changes the name to \"Updated Zapier Hook\" and additionally checks the \"Deal Stage Changed\" event. User clicks \"Save\".\n- **Expected:** The webhook is updated via the API. The modal closes. The webhook list shows the updated name \"Updated Zapier Hook\" and now displays three subscribed events: \"New Client Created\", \"Task Completed\", and \"Deal Stage Changed\".\n\n#### Cancel button closes modal without saving\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with some fields filled in.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Cancel\" button.\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No webhook is created or updated. The webhooks list remains unchanged.\n\n#### Modal closes on overlay click without saving\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the modal overlay (area outside the modal dialog).\n- **Expected:** The modal closes. No webhook is created or updated.\n\n#### URL placeholder updates based on selected platform\n- **Initial state:** The AddEditWebhookModal is open with no platform selected.\n- **Action:** User selects \"Zapier\", then \"n8n\", then \"Custom\" as the platform.\n- **Expected:** When \"Zapier\" is selected, the URL input placeholder shows a Zapier-style URL hint (e.g., \"https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/...\"). When \"n8n\" is selected, the placeholder changes to an n8n-style URL hint (e.g., \"https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...\"). When \"Custom\" is selected, the placeholder changes to a generic URL hint (e.g., \"https://your-server.com/webhook\").\n\n## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n\n## UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n\n## ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n\n## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":833,"oldLines":6,"newStart":833,"newLines":53,"lines":[" "," ## UsersListPage - Team (/users)"," ","+Components: UsersGrid, UserCard","+","+### UsersGrid","+","+#### Page displays heading \"Team\"","+- **Initial state:** User navigates to /users.","+- **Expected:** The page displays a heading \"Team\" at the top.
