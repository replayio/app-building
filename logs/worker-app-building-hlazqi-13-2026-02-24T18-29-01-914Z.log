Patterns\n    47→\n    48→### When Replay was most effective\n    49→\n    50→- **Backend-bug diagnosis:** Replay was decisive for the Sign In form failure. NetworkRequest revealed a 409 Conflict response with \"Email already in use\", pinpointing that the frontend sent `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`. Without Replay, this would have required significant trial-and-error debugging since the error was in request payload construction, not obvious from test output.\n    51→\n    52→- **State management bugs:** For the Auto-login confirmation failure, PlaywrightSteps showed the token was correctly stored in localStorage but the sidebar didn't update, revealing the Redux store wasn't being hydrated from localStorage on navigation. This led to the fix of adding a `loadSession` call on app startup and a `setSession` Redux action.\n    53→\n    54→- **Render timing analysis:** For timeout failures, DescribeComponent showed that SettingsPage rendered at 25.7s — close to the 30s timeout — confirming Replay browser overhead as the root cause rather than a code bug.\n    55→\n    56→- **Most effective tool sequences:**\n    57→  1. `PlaywrightSteps` → `NetworkRequest` — for API-related failures (identified malformed request payloads)\n    58→  2. `PlaywrightSteps` → `Screenshot` → `DescribeComponent` — for timeout failures (confirmed elements existed but loaded slowly)\n    59→  3. `PlaywrightSteps` alone — sufficient for state management bugs when the execution flow revealed the gap\n    60→\n    61→### When Replay was NOT used and why\n    62→\n    63→- **Batch diagnosis from shared root cause (4 failures):** Once the first two timeout failures were diagnosed via Replay as Replay browser overhead, the remaining 4 navigation link failures were immediately attributed to the same cause without needing individual Replay analysis. This was efficient and correct.\n    64→\n    65→- **Diagnosed from error output (2 failures):** The \"Logged in state\" timeout and the deployment infrastructure failure were both diagnosable from Playwright's error messages alone. The deployment failure showed \"Network error\" which directly pointed to a missing environment variable.\n    66→\n    67→### Common debugging strategies that worked\n    68→\n    69→1. **Increase timeouts for Replay browser:** 7 of 10 failures were timeouts caused by Replay browser overhead. The fix was increasing `actionTimeout`, `navigationTimeout`, and assertion timeouts in playwright.config.ts. This is an expected pattern when using Replay Chromium.\n    70→\n    71→2. **Trace state through the full pipeline:** For the auth bug, following the data from UI action → request payload → backend response → error revealed the exact point of failure (isSignUp state not being reset).\n    72→\n    73→3. **Fix infrastructure before debugging code:** The deployment failure was correctly identified as a missing env var rather than a code bug, avoiding wasted debugging effort.\n    74→\n    75→### Common debugging strategies that failed\n    76→\n    77→- No debugging strategies explicitly failed in this build cycle. All 10 failures were resolved successfully. However, the auto-login fix required 3 test runs because the first fix attempt (only adding `loadSession` to App.tsx) was incomplete — the agent needed to also add the `setSession` Redux action and dispatch it from ConfirmEmailPage.\n    78→\n    79→### Recurring failure categories\n    80→\n    81→- **Timeout (70%):** Dominated by Replay browser overhead. All 7 timeout failures had the same root cause — insufficient timeouts for the Replay Chromium browser which adds instrumentation overhead. This is a systemic issue that could be prevented by setting higher default timeouts in test configuration from the start.\n    82→\n    83→- **Backend-bug (20%):** Both backend bugs involved auth state management — one was a UI state (`isSignUp`) not being reset on mode switch, the other was Redux store not being hydrated from localStorage. Both point to state synchronization gaps in the auth flow.\n    84→\n    85→- **Infrastructure (10%):** Single deployment failure from a missing DATABASE_URL environment variable on Netlify.\n    86→\n    87→## 4. Recommendations\n    88→\n    89→### `skills/debugging/*.md`\n    90→\n    91→- **Add \"Replay browser timeout\" as a known pattern:** When multiple tests fail with timeouts in the first test run, and the app is a fresh build, the most likely cause is insufficient timeouts for Replay Chromium. Recommended fix: increase `actionTimeout` to 15s+, `navigationTimeout` to 30s+, and use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions.\n    92→\n    93→- **Add \"NetworkRequest for auth debugging\" pattern:** When auth-related tests fail, use `PlaywrightSteps` → `NetworkRequest` to inspect the exact request payloads and response bodies. Auth bugs frequently involve mismatched action types or missing fields in request bodies.\n    94→\n    95→- **Add \"State hydration\" debugging checklist:** For failures where an action succeeds (data in localStorage/network) but UI doesn't update, check: (1) Redux store dispatch, (2) localStorage → Redux hydration on mount, (3) component re-render triggers.\n    96→\n    97→### `skills/tasks/build/testing.md`\n    98→\n    99→- **Set Replay-aware timeouts from the start:** The playwright.config.ts template should include `actionTimeout: 15000`, `navigationTimeout: 30000`, and a note about Replay browser overhead. This would have prevented 7 of 10 failures (70%).\n   100→\n   101→- **Include `--functions` flag in webServer command:** Ensure the Playwright webServer command always includes `--functions ./netlify/functions` when using Netlify Functions to avoid function resolution failures.\n   102→\n   103→- **Pre-validate deployment environment variables:** Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL, etc.) are set on the deployment target. This prevents infrastructure failures that waste a test cycle.\n   104→\n   105→### `skills/review/reportTestFailures.md`\n   106→\n   107→- **Add \"Test Re-runs per Log\" to per-log analysis template:** The current template captures failure count but not how many test runs were needed to achieve all-pass. Adding a `TEST_RERUNS: <count>` field would make re-run statistics more precise in the synthesis.\n   108→\n   109→- **Add \"Root Cause Cluster\" field:** When multiple failures share a single root cause (like the 7 timeout failures here), a cluster field would reduce redundancy in the failure table and make patterns more visible. Example: `ROOT_CAUSE_CLUSTER: replay-browser-timeout` applied to all 7 timeout failures.\n   110→\n   111→- **Clarify \"Changeset\" field semantics:** All 10 failures had `CHANGESET_REVISION: none` despite fixes being applied. The field description references a \"CHANGESET REVISION:\" line in the log, but fixes applied during the same test-fixing session don't produce separate changesets. Consider whether this field should capture the commit that fixed the issue instead.\n   112→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"57e4fd3f-b269-48c8-848d-e756f8534702","uuid":"1dfd2c7c-d914-4abe-b288-4bf84070657e","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/reports/report-testFailures-sales-crm-3-review-3-20260224-175633.md","content":"# Test Failures Report: sales-crm-3-review-3\n\n**Generated:** 2026-02-24\n**Branch:** sales-crm-3-review-3\n**Scope:** Full build pipeline for SalesCRM app — project setup, test spec planning, component implementation, Playwright test writing, test fixing, deployment, directive compliance checks, and bug review.\n\n## 1.

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    replayReporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   175→   on what you found.\n   176→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   177→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   178→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   179→\n   180→### Bug Writeup Template\n   181→\n   182→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   183→\n   184→```\n   185→# Bug: <test name>\n   186→\n   187→## Step 1: Evidence\n   188→\n   189→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   190→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   191→no evidence.>\n   192→\n   193→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   194→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   195→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   196→\n   197→## Step 2: Determination\n   198→\n   199→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   200→\n   201→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   202→\n   203→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   204→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   205→```\n   206→\n   207→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   208→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   209→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   210→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   211→\n   212→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   213→\n   214→## Directives\n   215→\n   216→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   217→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   218→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   219→\n   220→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   222→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   223→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   224→\n   225→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   226→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   227→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   228→\n   229→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   230→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   231→\n   232→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   233→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   234→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   235→\n   236→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   237→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   238→\n   239→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   240→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   241→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   242→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   243→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   244→\n   245→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   246→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   247→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   248→\n   249→## Tips\n   250→\n   251→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   252→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   253→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   254→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   255→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   256→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   257→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   258→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   259→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   260→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   261→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   262→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   263→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   264→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   265→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   266→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   267→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   268→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   269→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   270→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   271→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   272→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   273→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   274→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   275→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   276→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   277→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   278→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   279→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   280→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   281→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   282→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   283→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   284→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   285→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   286→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   287→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   288→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   289→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   290→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   291→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   292→- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n   293→  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n   294→  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n   295→- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n   296→  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n   297→  cold start latency.\n   298→- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   299→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   300→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   301→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n","numLines":307,"startLine":1,"totalLines":307}}}

Let me apply the recommendations:\n\n### Recommendation 1: `skills/debugging/*.md`\n\n**a. Add \"Replay browser timeout\" as a known pattern to `timeouts.md`**\nWhen multiple tests fail with timeouts in the first test run, and the app is a fresh build, the most likely cause is insufficient timeouts for Replay Chromium. Recommended fix: increase `actionTimeout` to 15s+, `navigationTimeout` to 30s+, and use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions.\n\n\n**b. Add \"NetworkRequest for auth debugging\" pattern to `network-and-api.md`**\nWhen auth-related tests fail, I can use `PlaywrightSteps` → `NetworkRequest` to inspect the exact request payloads and response bodies, since auth bugs often involve mismatched action types or missing fields.\n**c. Add \"State hydration\" debugging checklist to `component-rendering.md`**\nFor failures where an action succeeds but the UI doesn't update, I need to check Redux store dispatch, localStorage → Redux hydration on mount, and component re-render triggers.\n\nNow I'm looking at the other recommendations: setting Replay-aware timeouts and including the `--functions` flag in the webServer command for testing, plus pre-validating deployment environment variables. I should also review the test failure reporting template to add \"Test Re-runs per Log\" and \"Root Cause Cluster\" fields, and clarify the \"Changeset\" semantics. Let me check `component-rendering.md` to confirm where the state hydration checklist belongs.","signature":"Ep4OCkYICxgCKkDL5LGIl4iur8cA3Vhl9l2aAU0Vv/pWL7+i39097wnF6ZlBIqpzMaNtadt3Wa1SRcj5wAtMALMvx6YioerGhU1UEgwOTTmvKVBehBvBhosaDAmJHt5qBDtHEwWnFyIw1NQpsoKzMDukkNzA4WbUxLOdn0+4C0jCaWFymm0fBoXmRi1EylR6yWmnccmGC4eHKoUNCbL8kJcg4KeWI2oDooHEok6uEY7xhevb8olwmcI69qVM86uRSYCH2q3TGihvth4VcYBgJDSObTcqe6qIaKTnwkwoRKdiV96Ev4M503kOh8CPT7HK8Z9ceVqFijMILmyuTKp50bUEQefXh6QEA1YC6VSXojPxX0jFAec+8ur2y7qP9rbGhnNQC/2y/syuGTqc9X+pQTwGhd8HqHHCG2oFk6JxiOL/yqXElOUhId/POpvo0HrClfqbpHs8DljsVVmbnCEIYhiwPqt+Cc3HzvZS0EmFpZ/9U7QKkBm/aJfTwomjzvEIoQeo+LVoFfZ0a+z9VB9DYoRnyB0uDf09fVyDEviBAw8cyak2X2pZTw+FcgofPmDYtUOFiDgqaYGgYx9Gt4HXWo/mXmyrStTFir0IFFRGNVL6fGe6ddEH96jp9GbePX3vQ7CxBBp/nfS92GiPGnXHhbQe1E0mIfTa2UOKnu6JvpVNXbVT06aCLSWYBS0virlcL0OOKZqUgEYNRCQ5DibgVp9aE46YWLbGsYiV8JqqR9gPvHvGnZsn3fQmujLJRvDFcqyMLDhlbQzu992GwGxHDDuNYQ6M3QS6AN0Tmv5QP72YKh6Tgju1D0nPgN7tUS5tXUTCUcD3MNYe8c8eVeIEMX6A4Opws6gI28YcnFnX8QI15QbJoKo2Ie8+lrlUM7cJUZReRfwu4j8zF3t3x4xsT/ph/4x1jzGbpNYXUOuLKRzHgftX3MNQ1tyQixYZeB0cCUMvSQKMTUH1PdGD2ysGHIa7cpM2DaVvRGArdkvDv/7nHiMt1vJBqex5WBoZYK1vxACTVFZUcZclOV/U+2AS5vfhhXIEDXkCyrqNyuo4UlSuK0Kf8efjBzdJBQ+lWAtZV4YHDwekvtz636rpt2wih8yWbmfv/JCvzSkvSETF+i2LF2q9zx9jadubY/ChorKEIewWoOPL7yAVtGIAWEhv9+e92Q1MzThl83RyKFqcYwrWkoGRmiYIM6Gk9T+Z0JAbjX8fw/WKTHnTKpy7UOz7JyJNhUm0u7XBqiFyzHALcEF0013hOY/+Cuj6C4cWA+hPCn+wGUYo4680QcS2xQmOgy4aFDaE+lReoXjq1o+OHIRHjr29oP6YsLkOr5Ae928vfQHOmE+3MTGjdbDwdB8ABZMSym+FMsxPQNBNL0DHyiOk9hW9Fx7PYYr9/kXCDSs6w8BaWJNKy/EcnQqkcyXwvUeHcuUYWJkBcEGYA7dZwEEunnhnzPrKd9MAp1N90MphuFwkZw7U0sbChTeECq03Yauia8Mm/bzTMnhyPyptoh8qNDCf188Yjgr3YDB0ESRLNtgKH9ioQ8V+fskteHpkz2aKiLSTv1V78/EsFo5hpDEsH/NpIQV9BJ405bjnl4gIZba6gYEUyDEq0C8DzdHUsF5JgAvnz9qSm9BPNSV0phI9glQUbFTaHpDVZEuroPMwFNw2C7BWRQAjom85MZ69C3ZkKNCIhSqvAoIyKmIzRO80CrjArt97hzxez8WTNq1s8xyMS1htBUwATk8Ka4SBdtO/ytucCbrS9bk7IXX8+x/pGUx6ltrHLknIsPq4e+KqBU6IACI+nXBSMXso+ykwSiyOtMs35A6wxXIIhBpxl8AjSi2V+fFtalIJ/XUPTdl0o/3pk5Bob5gQRfCJtFa1XJxqYRKuwOI6bJkc7tTf2R5cKjLTrm2vpZS+v8++EB8ePnVbwVtBNyFe+LwkSVu879cdnTjkf9cwTFr+Z6LYWaMhjnXg0iF4emH+JzMGC5B2Ag0VQ5cAyh65ypGnpxDRVU5vRYJH7G/xZePEOi0DvzTzFreBzq0vn3poTEv5Bintg0cP1sLNaR1UUmtNpGzUWzSdea7JqPY7v617mN4u2u2C7pA/d/aFApjPnflHNsrfXYczMObksWF+ZwqI5szbeyb6shWJl6OkOi0C5WN4XMrlgMt0P1L/cE5JOSx3Ou2tGL/6FxhzEp6nGJPTI4h97sfnd2pxr7+VR1b3wVTFEGvzoz6P1Vax80E1IoQLxz9DKn9fZjgwcO7At1dlM26XubyA8nR9jRoVMhIOa+XnMoQR9x1R6g0OejbnyWRjmGdCVThsP9igU8VA4qsi9VgdqhlPBMFZwZ0Aenkf07qnPyvuN8Vu0Mesqhd8pgG98e3cQiX/q0STnEbpPJ2wHcfZDzLesMvwl3C79HIxja0SiB8y/um6nCnv9GD+iOARf5mwmRgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4332,"cache_read_input_tokens":35236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4332,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"57e4fd3f-b269-48c8-848d-e756f8534702","uuid":"070941a7-37c8-4dc2-9e66-e1e4bfabe6f5"}

DescribeComponent confirmed elements rendered close to the timeout\nlimit.

The test hangs waiting for an element or\nassertion that never resolves. Error messages alone rarely reveal the root cause — you need\nto see which step got stuck and what the page looked like at that moment.\n\n## Tool Sequence\n\n1. **`PlaywrightSteps`** — Always start here. Shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions\n   with timestamps. Look for the last step that completed and the step that is stuck. Common\n   stuck patterns:\n   - A `click` targeting an element that doesn't exist or is hidden\n   - A `fill` on an input with the wrong type (e.g., `type=\"date\"` rejecting `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`)\n   - A `waitForSelector` on a wrong `data-testid`\n   - A step inside `.toPass()` that triggers Playwright's internal auto-wait\n\n2. **`Screenshot`** — Take a screenshot at the point of the stuck step. This shows:\n   - Whether the page rendered at all (empty `#root` = app didn't mount)\n   - Whether the target element is visible but has a different selector\n   - Whether a modal/dialog is blocking the expected element\n   - Whether the page is showing an error state\n\n3. **`ConsoleMessages`** — Check for JavaScript errors that prevented rendering or interaction.\n\n## Common Root Causes (from observed failures)\n\n### Wrong locator / data-testid\nA step tries to click `data-testid=\"client-row\"` but the actual attribute is\n`data-testid=\"client-row-123\"`. PlaywrightSteps shows the step stuck at \"click\", and\nScreenshot shows the element exists with a different testid.\n\n**Fix**: Update the locator to match the actual testid. Use `getByTestId` with a pattern\nor the exact value.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-20T12-51-54-645Z.log` — TDP-HDR-02 timed out clicking a client\nrow. PlaywrightSteps showed step 31 stuck. Screenshot showed rows existed with\n`data-testid=\"client-row-*\"` not plain `tr`.\n\n### `.toPass()` deadlock (nested auto-wait)\nA `.toPass()` retry block contains `count()`, `textContent()`, or other auto-waiting locator\ncalls. When the DOM changes between iterations, the inner call waits for its own timeout,\nwhich blocks `.toPass()` from retrying.\n\n**Fix**: Replace loops inside `.toPass()` with single atomic assertions:\n- `count()` → `toHaveCount()`\n- `textContent()` → `toContainText()`\n- `isVisible()` → `toBeVisible()`\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-19T23-29-46-713Z.log` — DATA-02 timed out because\n`taskCards.nth(4).textContent()` auto-waited inside `.toPass()`.\n\n### Wrong input format\nA `fill()` call provides a value in the wrong format for the input type. For example,\n`type=\"date\"` expects `YYYY-MM-DD` but the test provides `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`.\n\n**Fix**: Match the format to the HTML input type.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-20T13-00-10-123Z.log` — TDP-HDR-01 failed with \"Malformed value\"\non date input. PlaywrightSteps showed the fill step, Replay confirmed the input type.\n\n### Browser-native validation blocking form submission\nA form has `<input type=\"email\">` and the test fills an intentionally invalid email to test\napp-level validation. But the browser's native validation fires first, preventing\n`handleSubmit` from ever running.\n\n**Fix**: Add `noValidate` to the `<form>` element so app-level validation handles it.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T04-24-50-090Z.log` — \"Submit with Invalid Email Format\" test.\nPlaywrightSteps confirmed the click happened but no validation error appeared.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":58,"oldLines":6,"newStart":58,"newLines":24,"lines":[" *Example*: `worker-2026-02-20T13-00-10-123Z.log` — TDP-HDR-01 failed with \"Malformed value\""," on date input.

Check:\n   - Did the expected API call happen?\n   - What status code was returned?\n   - What was the response body?\n   - Were there unexpected duplicate requests?\n\n2. **`ConsoleMessages`** — Check for logged errors from failed fetch calls.\n\n3. **`Logpoint`** — Place logpoints on API handler code (Netlify functions) or frontend\n   fetch calls to inspect request/response data at runtime. Useful for seeing:\n   - What parameters were sent to the API\n   - What the database query returned\n   - How the response was transformed before reaching the UI\n\n4. **`SearchSources`** — Check hit counts on API handler lines. If a handler was called\n   0 times, the request never reached it (routing issue). If called more times than expected,\n   something is triggering duplicate requests.\n\n5. **`ReadSource`** — Read the actual source code of API handlers to verify the logic.\n\n## Data-Flow Tracing with Logpoint + SearchSources\n\nWhen the UI renders but displays wrong values (wrong names, incorrect counts, stale data),\nuse this sequence to trace data from API response through state management to component props:\n\n1. **`SearchSources`** — Search for the API handler or fetch call. Check hit counts to\n   confirm the code executed.\n2. **`Logpoint`** — Place logpoints on the API response handler to see the exact data\n   returned. Then place logpoints on state update dispatches and component render functions\n   to trace how the data flowed through the app.\n3. **`NetworkRequest`** — Verify the raw API response matches what the logpoints showed.\n   Discrepancies indicate a transformation bug between fetch and state update.\n\nThis is especially useful for seed data mismatches where tests expect specific values\n(e.g., assignee names) that don't exist in the database.\n\n*Example*: `worker-…04-27-52.log` — \"Action menu Edit opens task edit dialog\" failed because\ntests expected fictional assignee names. SearchSources → Logpoint → NetworkRequest traced\nthe mismatch from API response through to component rendering.\n\n## Common Root Causes (from observed failures)\n\n### Missing database columns (schema migration)\n`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` doesn't modify existing tables. When new columns are added to\nthe schema definition, existing ephemeral branches don't get them.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows API returning 500. ConsoleMessages or test\noutput shows `NeonDbError: column \"X\" does not exist`.\n\n**Fix**: Add `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` migration statements.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T04-05-00-483Z.log` — \"column owner_id does not exist\". Fixed\nby adding a `runMigrations` function with ALTER TABLE statements.\n\n### Missing environment variables on deployment\nNetlify functions return errors because DATABASE_URL or other env vars aren't configured\non the Netlify site.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows function endpoints returning 500 or error\nJSON. ConsoleMessages shows connection/auth errors.\n\n**Fix**: Set env vars via `netlify env:set` or the Netlify dashboard.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T03-42-03-835Z.log` — Deployment test failed because Netlify\nfunctions lacked DATABASE_URL.\n\n### Database authentication errors\nA stale or rotated database password causes all API calls to fail with authentication errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows all data-fetching endpoints returning errors.\n\n**Fix**: Update the database connection string with the current password.\n\n### Import dialog closing before results display\nA component calls `onImported()` (which closes a dialog) before the import results are\navailable to display. The dialog unmounts, losing the results.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the import API call succeeding. SearchSources\nshows the results rendering code has 0 hits (component unmounted before it could render).\n\n**Fix**: Delay calling `onImported()` until after results are displayed, or keep the dialog\nopen until the user dismisses it.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T09-35-37-625Z.log` — Import dialog test. Replay showed the\nAPI succeeded but `onImported()` closed the dialog before results rendered.\n\n### Database CHECK constraint violation\nA form sends a value that violates a database CHECK constraint (e.g., status `'active'` when\nthe column only allows `'open'`, `'won'`, `'lost'`). The API returns 500 but the error\nmessage may not clearly indicate which value is invalid.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the POST/PUT returning 500. Logpoint on the\nhandler reveals the exact constraint error (e.g., `new row violates check constraint`).\nReadSource on the handler confirms which values are sent.\n\n**Fix**: Update the form/component to send only values that match the database enum.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-21T17-31-25-892Z.log` — CreateDealModal sent `'on_track'` as\nstatus but DB only accepted `'open'`/`'won'`/`'lost'`. 10 Replay tools used to trace.\n\n### Stale dev server with deleted Neon branch\nWhen `reuseExistingServer` in Playwright config reuses a dev server whose `DATABASE_URL`\npoints to a deleted ephemeral Neon branch, all API calls fail with auth or connection errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows no API calls or all returning errors.\nLocalStorage + GetStack traces the auth token lifecycle to find where it breaks. The\nrecording shows the frontend working but all data requests failing.\n\n**Fix**: Kill the stale dev server and let Playwright start a fresh one with the correct\n`DATABASE_URL`. Set `reuseExistingServer: false` or add cleanup logic.\n\n*Example*: `worker-2026-02-18T19-13-46-356Z.log` — 8 Replay tools traced from \"no API\ncalls\" → \"auth token removed\" → \"JWT ok but DB query fails on deleted branch\".\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":47,"oldLines":6,"newStart":47,"newLines":46,"lines":[" "," ## Common Root Causes (from observed failures)"," ","+### Auth request payload mismatch","+An auth-related test fails because the frontend sends the wrong action type or missing fields","+in the request payload (e.g., `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`).

Before attempting to debug a test failure, scan these guides for the category\nthat matches your failure and follow the recommended tool sequence.\n\n## Guides\n\n- `timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps (most common failure type)\n- `race-conditions.md` — Parallel test interference, flaky assertions, state corruption\n- `component-rendering.md` — Components not mounting, empty DOM, React rendering issues\n- `network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing data, wrong responses\n- `form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions, browser-native behavior\n- `seed-data.md` — Missing test data, empty collections, count mismatches\n\n## Default First-Line Sequence: PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot\n\nFor most test failures, start with this two-tool sequence before diving deeper:\n\n1. **`PlaywrightSteps`** — Shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps.\n   Identifies which step stalled or failed.\n2. **`Screenshot`** — Take a screenshot at the stuck step's point. Shows whether the page\n   rendered, whether the target element is visible, and whether something is blocking it.\n\nThis was the most frequently used and successful Replay combination (used in 6/9 Replay\nsessions with 100% success rate). After this sequence, use **`NetworkRequest`** as a\nstandard second step when the UI renders but shows wrong data or times out waiting for\ncontent — it confirms whether the backend returned the expected data.\n\n## No-Replay Diagnostic Patterns\n\nSome failures can be diagnosed from Playwright error output alone without needing Replay:\n\n### Strict mode violation\nWhen Playwright reports `strict mode violation` with N matching elements, the fix is almost\nalways to add more specific selectors. Common fixes:\n- Add `nth(0)` or `first()` to narrow to a single match\n- Use `filter({ hasText: ... })` to disambiguate\n- Add a unique `data-testid` attribute to the target element\n\nReplay is not needed — the error message tells you exactly how many elements matched and\nwhat the ambiguous locator was.\n\n## Quick Reference: Which Tool to Start With\n\n| Symptom | Start with |\n|---------|-----------|\n| Test timed out | `PlaywrightSteps` |\n| Element not found / count mismatch | `PlaywrightSteps` then `Screenshot` |\n| Wrong data displayed | `NetworkRequest` then `Logpoint` |\n| Component not rendering | `Screenshot` then `ConsoleMessages` |\n| API returning errors | `NetworkRequest` then `ConsoleMessages` |\n| Assertion wrong value | `Evaluate` or `Logpoint` |\n| Flaky / intermittent | `PlaywrightSteps` then `Logpoint` on shared state |\n| Uncaught exception | `UncaughtException` then `GetStack` |\n| DB constraint violation (500) | `NetworkRequest` then `Logpoint` on handler |\n| Click times out on toggle/checkbox | `PlaywrightSteps` then check if testid is on sr-only element |\n| All API calls failing after setup | `NetworkRequest` then `LocalStorage` (stale server?) |\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":56,"oldLines":3,"newStart":56,"newLines":6,"lines":[" | DB constraint violation (500) | `NetworkRequest` then `Logpoint` on handler |"," | Click times out on toggle/checkbox | `PlaywrightSteps` then check if testid is on sr-only element |"," | All API calls failing after setup | `NetworkRequest` then `LocalStorage` (stale server?) |","+| Multiple timeouts on fresh build | `PlaywrightSteps` then `DescribeComponent` (Replay browser overhead?) |","+| Auth test returns 409/400 | `PlaywrightSteps` then `NetworkRequest` (check request payload) |","+| Action succeeds but UI doesn't update | `NetworkRequest`/`LocalStorage` then `ReactRenders` (state hydration gap?) |"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":95,"oldLines":6,"newStart":95,"newLines":13,"lines":[" `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite.

An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":296,"oldLines":6,"newStart":296,"newLines":9,"lines":["   or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain.
