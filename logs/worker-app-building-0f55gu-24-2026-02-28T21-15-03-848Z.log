Here's a summary of the work done:\n\n**PlanPageTransactions** - Reviewed and enhanced TransactionsPage test entries (61 total tests across 8 components):\n\n- **NewTransactionButton** (4 tests): Added page heading \"Transactions\" test and \"Filters\" section label test. Existing button display and navigation tests confirmed.\n- **DateRangeFilter** (4 tests): Display, interaction, filtering, and clearing all covered.\n- **AccountFilter** (5 tests): Multi-select dropdown, filtering, count display, reset all covered.\n- **MaterialFilter** (5 tests): Same pattern as AccountFilter - thorough coverage.\n- **TransactionTypeFilter** (5 tests): Including Clear Filters link test covering all filters.\n- **SearchBar** (8 tests): Added combined multi-filter test (date + material + type).

No test failures - this was a test spec writing task.\n\n3. **dm9i32-10**: CheckDirectives task for DashboardPage in SupplierTracker. \n\n1 violation found (missing \"Quick Actions\" heading). No test failures - this was a directive checking task.\n\n4. **dm9i32-100**: WriteTests task for Accounting - TransactionHeaderFields tests (currency dropdown, layout). Wrote 3 tests. Added chevron icon to SearchableSelect. No test failures - test writing only.\n\n5. **dm9i32-101**: WriteTests task for Accounting - LineItemsTable tests (heading, column headers, account dropdown, placeholder). Wrote 4 tests. Added data-testid attributes. No test failures.\n\n6. **dm9i32-102**: WriteTests task for Accounting - Line\n\nContinuing with more LineItemsTable tests covering Type dropdown, default values, amount field, and delete functionality - 4 tests written with no failures. Then moved through BalanceIndicator tests across multiple tasks, covering debit/credit scenarios, balance states, dynamic updates, and validation - wrote 8 tests total with seed data added. Now working through TagsInput tests for label, chips, add, and remove functionality.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":9747,"cache_read_input_tokens":46060,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":9747,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e6c940c6-c9c4-43a3-baf6-509b1850fa41","uuid":"8ac9e219-0789-4bea-9113-44fa4e1c9474"}
