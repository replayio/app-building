Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→\n    30→## Database Schema\n    31→\n    32→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    33→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    34→the test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    35→\n    36→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    37→\n    38→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    39→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    40→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    41→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    42→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    43→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    44→\n    45→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    46→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    47→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    48→\n    49→## Directives\n    50→\n    51→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    52→\n    53→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    54→\n    55→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    56→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes organized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial write app job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a setup group:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"SetupApp: Setup the app\" \\\n  --job \"DesignDatabase: Design the database\"\n```\n\nThen add one group per page, containing all components and the page itself:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component1>: Write the <Component1> component\" \\\n  --job \"WriteComponent<Component2>: Write the <Component2> component\" \\\n  --job \"WritePage<Name>: Write the page itself\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- Write clean, working code. No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n- If AppStyle.md is present, use it to style the pages and components appropriately. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n\n## Database Schema\n\nThe app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\nthe test and deploy scripts (see `strategies/scripts/test.md` and `strategies/scripts/deploy.md`).\n\n**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n\n- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n\nThe app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\nthat `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files.

Let the parent page/layout control spacing.

This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":133,"startLine":1,"totalLines":133}}}

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientsListPage - Check testSpec.md directive violations in ClientsListPage test entries\n\nI need to check the test entries in docs/tests.md (lines 3-312) against the directives in testSpec.md.\n\n### testSpec.md Directives:\n\n1. **Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.**\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n\n\n3. **Don't swap in simpler elements for what's actually shown — if the mockup displays complex columns with joins or computed values, test all of them, and if there are four filter controls, test all four rather than just the easiest ones.**\n4. **Every clickable element needs a specific navigation target or action result spelled out; don't leave destinations vague, and for buttons opening external flows, clarify how they open and what happens when complete.**\n5. **For any data-mutating action, verify the change persists correctly and that the exact right side effects occur.**\n6. **Button and control appearance matters — if the mockup specifies particular text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that appearance, not just that a button exists.**\n7. **Modal dialogs need complete testing to ensure they work properly.**\n8. **Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup indicates otherwise.**\n9. **Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format with required columns and accepted values, and tests should verify that format documentation is visible before the user attempts the import.**\n10. **Backend integrations require instructions visible in the configuration UI** (not applicable here).\n11. **State-changing actions need tests confirming that other parts of the app update appropriately when those actions are performed.**\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test entries for each section to ensure they cover the necessary ground. The sidebar navigation tests look solid — they're checking the logo, nav links, icons, active states, and profile dropdown with logout functionality. For the search and filters section, I'm verifying that the tests cover filtering by name, tag, and contact name, plus the empty state and status dropdown behavior.\n\nContinuing through the ClientsActions tests, I'm checking that the import button opens the dialog with proper CSV format documentation, the import process handles valid files with preview and confirmation, invalid files are rejected, and the export button downloads the data in the correct CSV format while respecting any active filters.\n\nNow moving into the Add New Client functionality—verifying the creation dialog opens with all required form fields, validates inputs properly, successfully creates clients, and can be dismissed. Then I'm documenting the ClientsTable structure, checking that all column headers display correctly, client names appear as clickable links to their detail pages, type and status columns show the appropriate values with color coding, tags render as chips, and the primary contact field displays the contact's name and role in the specified format.\n\nFor the remaining table columns, I'm verifying the Open Deals column shows both count and total value, the Next Task column displays the upcoming task with its date, and row actions work as expected—the menu opens with all options, \"View Details\" navigates to the client detail page, \"Edit\" opens the edit dialog and can be cancelled, and \"Delete\" triggers a confirmation flow that updates the pagination count when confirmed. The table also handles the empty state correctly when no clients exist. Pagination tests are all passing as well.\n\nNow I'm double-checking the side effects directive more carefully. The \"Add New Client form creates a client successfully\" test should verify that creating a client triggers side effects like a timeline entry, though that might not apply here since the ClientsListPage doesn't have a timeline. Looking at the test entry itself, it specifies checking for a success message after creation, but I need to verify the actual test implementation matches this requirement—it should confirm the dialog closes, the new client appears in the table with correct details, and a success message displays. The first test entry seems acceptable since showing the client in the table implies it was persisted. For the other mutation tests, they all check that the changes are reflected in the UI. Now I'm looking at directive 11 about state-changing actions - when a client is created, edited, or deleted, do other parts of the app update accordingly? The creation test doesn't verify whether the client shows up elsewhere, like on a Dashboard with recent clients.\n\nBut since this is specifically a test spec for ClientsListPage, cross-page effects probably belong in other test suites. I'm now systematically checking that every visible element has coverage: the sidebar, search and filter controls, action buttons, status badges, and pagination all appear to be tested. For clickable elements, I'm verifying the navigation targets - client names and view details buttons both go to the client detail page, and I need to confirm the dashboard link destination. → /dashboard ✅\n- Deals link → /deals ✅\n- Tasks link → /tasks ✅\n- Reports link → /reports ✅\n- Settings link → /settings ✅\n- Log Out → /login ✅\n\n**Directive 6: Button and control appearance matters.**\n- Import button: \"with download icon\" ✅\n- Export button: \"with upload icon\" ✅\n- Add New Client: \"primary blue button\" ✅\n\n**Directive 7: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.**\n- Import dialog: open, process CSV, cancel, reject invalid ✅\n- Add New Client dialog: open, validate, create, cancel ✅\n- Edit dialog: open pre-populated, edit, cancel ✅\n- Delete confirmation: confirm, cancel ✅\n\n**Directive 9: Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.**\n- Test: \"Import button opens import dialog\" includes: \"the dialog shows instructions for the expected CSV format including required columns (Client Name, Type, Status) and optional columns (Tags, Source, Primary Contact)\" ✅\n\nLooking at the test entries for the ClientsListPage, they seem pretty comprehensive. I'm noticing something in the \"Add New Client form creates a client successfully\" test though—it specifies that the client should have the correct Type, Status, Tags, and Source values, and according to Directive 5, it should also display a success message like \"Client created successfully\". Let me verify if the ClientFormModal component actually implements this success message behavior.\n\nChecking the code, the `handleSubmit` function calls `onSubmit` and then `onClose()`, but there's no toast or notification being shown. The test spec correctly requires this success message per the directives, even though the actual implementation doesn't have it yet—that's a code issue for later, not a test spec problem.\n\nLet me search through the test spec more carefully for any directive violations. I'm also realizing the test spec doesn't mention anything about the Source field being displayed as a dropdown option in the filter section.\n\nLooking at the Source dropdown test entry, it says the user selects 'Referral' from the dropdown, which is good. For the Add New Client form, the test spec notes \"Source (dropdown or text input)\" which matches the actual implementation. The clearing search test entry mentions \"backspace or clear icon\" which covers the interaction properly. For the empty state, the test spec says \"No clients yet. Add your first client to get started\" and mentions there \"may be a call-to-action button,\" but the code doesn't actually have a CTA button—just the text message.\n\nSince the test entry uses \"may\" language, this isn't a directive violation. The ClientsListPage test spec looks clean overall.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the writeApp.md directives for the ClientsListPage components themselves. The key directives are about matching test entries to code requirements, ensuring visual elements match the mockup, adding data-testid attributes to interactive elements and list items, and handling monorepo structure properly.\n\nFor the backend-related directives, I need to verify the neon serverless driver uses tagged template literals, that DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns convert empty strings to null, and that Netlify Functions correctly parse resource IDs from the path. I'm also checking the ClientFormModal to see if it uses a searchable select for entity references—the Source field is free text which is fine, but I need to verify how the Tags field is implemented.\n\nThe remaining checks are passing: navigation sidebars have unique paths, filter controls use custom dropdowns instead of native HTML selects, attachment displays show file-type icons, the import modal supports file uploads, and I need to verify that page components have consistent padding on their root elements.\n\nNow I'm systematically verifying each component—ClientsListPage has the proper test ID and padding classes, Sidebar has test IDs on interactive elements with no duplicate nav links, and ClientsSearchAndFilters uses custom dropdown components with test IDs on all interactive elements.\n\nClientsTable, ClientsActions, ClientFormModal, and Pagination all have comprehensive test IDs on their interactive elements and action menus. The form modal specifically uses custom dropdowns for Type and Status rather than native select elements, which aligns with the design requirements.\n\nLet me now verify that the test entry requirements are actually satisfied by the app code.\n\nI'm checking the \"Add New Client form creates a client successfully\" test requirement, which specifies that a success message should be shown after creation. Looking at the ClientFormModal and ClientsActions code, the handleCreate function dispatches the createClient action and then closes the modal, but there's no success toast or message displayed—that's a gap. The Import feature does show a success message properly, but the client creation flow is missing this notification, which violates the test entry requirement that the app code should satisfy.\n\nFor the other operations, I'm verifying the test specs: Edit doesn't require a success message (just that the updated name appears in the table), Delete doesn't mention one either, and I should check what Export specifies as well. I'm verifying the remaining UI elements match the test specs—the search placeholder, sort dropdown default, and icon usage all check out. I've identified one potential issue so far: the missing success message when creating a new client. Now I need to understand if the app has a success notification system elsewhere, like in the ImportModal, that should also apply here. I need to distinguish between the Directives section (lines 49-98) and the Tips section that follows, since I'm specifically checking for directive violations. Let me focus on what's actually required in the Directives section rather than the Tips.\n\nLooking at the key directives: the test entries need success messages for client creation, which appears to be missing. The visual styling seems aligned with the spec description, though I can't fully verify without the mockup images. All components have the required data-testid attributes. The netlify.toml configuration for the monorepo setup needs verification but that's infrastructure-level rather than component code. I'm partway through checking the remaining directives.\n\nFor the database and backend requirements around the neon driver, null conversion for empty date/timestamp fields, and Netlify Functions path handling—those are backend concerns I'll address separately. The modal implementation correctly uses free-text input for the Source field rather than a searchable dropdown, which is appropriate here. Navigation links are all unique with no duplicates. Still need to verify that filter controls aren't using native HTML select elements.\n\nThe main issue I'm spotting is that the app doesn't display a success message when creating a client, but the test spec expects one. Let me double-check if there's a toast system I'm missing, and also verify whether the form properly captures and validates the Type, Status, Tags, and Source fields as the test requires. Looking at the client creation flow, the form just closes after submission without displaying any success notification. The test itself doesn't verify a success message either, even though the test spec requires one—so this is a gap in both the component implementation and the test coverage.\n\nNow I'm checking the data-testid attributes across the components to ensure they match the writeApp.md requirements for E2E testing. Going through ClientsTable to verify each interactive element and list item has proper test identifiers. Adding test IDs to the remaining components... I'm checking the Directives section of the strategy document to see if there are any violations I missed. The Tips section mentions something about layout-agnostic components and avoiding outer padding, but since the strategy specifically calls out checking Directives, I'll stick with that focus rather than getting sidetracked by the Tips.\n\nSo for Job 1, there are no violations. For Job 2, I found one issue: the code doesn't implement the success message that the test spec requires when a client is created. Let me verify this by looking back at the test specification to make sure I'm reading it correctly.\n\nThe spec is clear—it explicitly states that a success message should be shown after the client is created, something like \"Client created successfully\". Since the component code doesn't include this, that's a directive 1 violation.\n\nNow I'm moving on to Job 3 and checking the writeTests.md directives for the ClientsListPage tests. The first directive requires that navigation tests verify the target URL or page content precisely. Looking through the test files, the sidebar navigation tests use `toHaveURL()` to check the correct routes, and the table tests do the same when verifying that clicking client names or action menu items navigates to the right pages. Those are all passing the checks so far.\n\nThe second directive says that when a component appears across multiple pages, tests need to interact with it on each page without relying on `page.goto()` to navigate back. The sidebar navigation test clicks through Dashboard → Deals → Tasks → Reports → Settings by clicking the sidebar links on each page rather than using `page.goto()`, so that's working correctly.\n\nFor side effects, I need to verify both the primary action and its consequence, and confirm the side effect happens exactly once. The delete test in table.spec.ts checks that deletion occurs and the pagination count decreases by exactly one, which covers this requirement.\n\nNow I'm checking all test files for `getByText()` usage with common words—sidebar.spec.ts, pagination.spec.ts, and search-and-filters.spec.ts all avoid it in favor of `getByTestId`.\n\nThe `data-testid` values across all test files are consistent with the component code. For file upload tests, both the valid and invalid CSV scenarios use `setInputFiles()` to exercise actual upload mechanics.\n\nI need to verify that Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics aren't placed inside `.toPass()` retry blocks...\n\nchecking all spec files shows no `.toPass()` usage at all, which means this constraint is satisfied.\n\nNow I'm examining whether tests that describe field interactions actually exercise those specific fields—the edit dialog test only modifies the name field so far, but I need to see if it covers all the interactions described in the spec entry.\n\nLooking at the \"Add New Client\" test, it fills in multiple fields like name, type, status, tags, and source, but then only verifies the client name appears in the table without checking that the other columns (Type, Status, Tags, Source) are correctly populated—that's a gap between what the spec promises and what the test validates. The test also doesn't check for a success message.\n\nFor the parallel test design directives, the import and add client cancellation tests properly use relative count comparisons rather than absolute counts, and the delete test follows the same pattern by checking `beforeTotal - 1`. Now I'm checking whether tests hardcode database IDs...\n\nall of them use dynamic IDs, so that's good. The Playwright config should have `fullyParallel: true` set, though I haven't verified that yet.\n\nLooking at the \"Add New Client form creates a client successfully\" test more closely, it's only verifying the client name appears in a row but not checking that the Type, Status, Tags, and Source columns are populated correctly. There's also no success message verification, though that's actually a component-level gap—the component itself doesn't display a success message, so the test can't assert something that doesn't exist. That would require adding the message to the component first, then updating the test.\n\nNow examining the sort and filter tests more carefully. The \"Sort dropdown changes table ordering\" test retrieves all client names and compares them against a sorted version, which works fine since it's not wrapped in a `.toPass()` block, though the snapshot comparison could potentially be flaky if data is still loading. The \"Tags dropdown filters by tag\" test is next on my list to review. Looking at the Multiple filters test, I'm seeing a similar pattern where it's iterating through rows and checking their status and tags, but again there's no `.toPass()` block involved, so this doesn't violate directive 7. ✅\n\nNow checking the Status dropdown filter test—it's looping through status badges and verifying they show 'Active', but again, not wrapped in `.toPass()`. ✅\n\nI'm also reconsidering the writeTests.md directive about field-specific interactions: when a test describes editing or interacting with a particular field, it needs to actually exercise that exact field with matching actions and assertions, rather than just checking a subset of fields.\n\nLooking at the \"Add New Client form creates a client successfully\" test, the spec requires entering Client Name, Type, Status, Tags, and Source, then verifying all those fields appear correctly in the table. The test fills all the fields properly, but the assertion only checks if the row with the name is visible—it never validates that Type, Status, Tags, and Source are actually present in that row. That's a violation of the directive.\n\nThe \"Row action menu 'Edit' opens edit dialog\" test in table.spec.ts is fine since it only needs to verify the name change, which it does.\n\nNow I'm checking whether all test spec entries have corresponding test implementations, starting with the Sidebar tests—the first three entries map to sidebar.spec.ts, though I need to verify the third one about highlighting the active page is actually covered.\n\nThe user profile dropdown test also has a corresponding implementation in sidebar.spec.ts. Moving to the ClientsSearchAndFilters section, all seven filter-related tests appear to have implementations in search-and-filters.spec.ts, covering name, tag, contact name filtering, empty states, and the various dropdown filters for status, tags, and source.\n\nContinuing with the remaining search and filter tests: the sort dropdown, combined filters, and search reset functionality are all mapped to search-and-filters.spec.ts. For ClientsActions, I'm tracking the import and export functionality tests—the import button, CSV processing, cancellation, validation, export button, and filter-respecting exports all route to actions.spec.ts, with the Add New Client button test appearing to be cut off.\n\nNow moving into the Add New Client form tests: validation of required fields, successful client creation, and dialog cancellation are all in actions.spec.ts. For the ClientsTable component, I'm documenting the column header display, clickable client name links, type and status columns with their respective formatting, tags as chips, and the primary contact information display—all mapped to table.spec.ts.\n\nContinuing with the remaining table tests: the Open Deals column showing count and value, Next Task with description and date, the row action menu with its View Details, Edit, and Delete options including confirmation flows, and the empty state when no clients exist. Then moving into pagination tests starting with the correct count display. I'm checking whether the \"Add New Client\" test verifies the success message that the spec requires, and I notice it doesn't—though that's a separate issue from spec violations. For the deletion test, both the removal from the table and pagination count updates are properly checked. Let me compile my findings on what actually violates the testSpec.md directives.\n\nThe test entries themselves follow all requirements, so no violations there. However, the app code is missing the success message that the spec explicitly requires, which breaks the writeApp.md directive about satisfying entry requirements. Additionally, the test for creating a client only checks the name field but doesn't verify that Type, Status, Tags, and Source are correctly populated in the table, which violates writeTests.md's directive to verify all relevant properties.\n\nBoth issues stem from the same incomplete client creation flow, so I should group them into a single fix that adds the success message to the component

Here's a summary:\n\n### Job 1: CheckTestSpecClientsListPage\n**No violations found.** All test entries in docs/tests.md for ClientsListPage properly follow testSpec.md directives — every element is inventoried, all clickable elements specify exact navigation targets, modals are fully tested, import dialog specifies data format, and side effects are covered.\n\n### Job 2: CheckComponentsClientsListPage\n**1 violation found:** `ClientsActions.tsx` `handleCreate` doesn't show a success message after client creation, but the test spec requires \"a success message is shown (e.g., 'Client created successfully')\". The app has a `success-toast` pattern (used in `TasksHeader.tsx`) that should be replicated here.\n\n### Job 3: CheckTestsClientsListPage  \n**2 violations found:**\n1. `actions.spec.ts` \"Add New Client form creates a client successfully\" test doesn't verify Type, Status, Tags, and Source columns of the created client (only checks name appears in a row)\n2. Same test doesn't assert a success message is shown (linked to the component gap in Job 2)\n\nA fix group has been added to the queue to address all violations.\n\n<DONE>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"fc0699c8-b683-44b1-b158-26c917ea3b78","total_cost_usd":1.5072693999999998,"usage":{"input_tokens":20,"cache_creation_input_tokens":73556,"cache_read_input_tokens":1034558,"output_tokens":18001,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":73556},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":20,"outputTokens":18001,"cacheReadInputTokens":1034558,"cacheCreationInputTokens":73556,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.4271289999999996,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":10541,"outputTokens":3774,"cacheReadInputTokens":309594,"cacheCreationInputTokens":15816,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.08014040000000001,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"f540d974-00a9-4215-9513-d87b6613b00a"}
