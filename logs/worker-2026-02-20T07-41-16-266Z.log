Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry.

This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly.

For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input).

Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely.

[2026-02-20T07:35:11.934Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Pae38rDMBRSMnVByZQHjzn","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have all the context I need. Let me start with the three jobs:\n\n1. **CheckTestSpecDealDetailPage**: Check testSpec.md directive violations in DealDetailPage test entries (section 5 of tests.md)\n2. **CheckComponentsDealDetailPage**: Check writeApp.md directive violations in DealDetailPage components\n3. **CheckTestsDealDetailPage**: Check writeTests.md directive violations in DealDetailPage tests\n\nLet me start with Job 1: checking testSpec.md directives against the DealDetailPage test entries.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n\n2. I need to systematically catalog every visible element in the mockups—column headers, filters, buttons, icons, badges, sections—and write a test for each one, being careful not to overlook minor details.\n3. I shouldn't swap in easier-to-implement elements for what's actually shown; if the mockup displays complex columns requiring joins or computed values, I test all of them, and if there are four filter controls, I test all four rather than just the simplest ones.\n4. For every clickable element, the test must specify exactly where it navigates or what action it triggers.\n5. When user actions change data, I need to verify the changes persist and that side effects occur correctly—like history entries being created exactly once, not duplicated.\n6. Button appearance matters too; if the mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that exact appearance.\n7. Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they function properly.\n8. File uploads should be supported in attachment functionality unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs must specify the expected data format, including required columns, accepted values, and file types.\n10. For backend integrations like webhooks and OAuth apps, I need to include complete setup instructions directly in the configuration UI, tailored to each external service rather than generic. The instructions should show users where to find URLs, what payload format they'll receive, and any external configuration needed, with tests verifying these instructions are visible and accurate for each platform.\n11. State-changing actions require tests confirming that other parts of the app update accordingly—for instance, if there's a timeline feature, every mutation it tracks must create a history entry atomically to prevent duplicates from re-renders.\n\nNow I'm examining the DealDetailPage test entries against these directives and need to check the mockup for completeness. I should systematically verify that all visible elements are inventoried and tested, clickable elements have exact navigation targets, mutating actions are tested for persistence and side effects, modal dialogs are fully tested, attachment uploads are properly specified, and button appearance is covered. I also need to review the DealDetailPage components to ensure data-testid attributes are on interactive elements and that the writeApp.md directives are being

Let me work through each job systematically.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecDealDetailPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in DealDetailPage test entries\n\nLet me go through each testSpec.md directive against the DealDetailPage test entries (section 5 of tests.md):\n\n### Directive 1: Consistent navigation/styling\nNot really relevant to individual test entries — more about overall design consistency.\n\n### Directive 2: Systematically inventory every visible element\nLet me check the mockup. Actually, I don't have the mockup image loaded. Let me look at what the test spec covers vs the components:\n\n\nI'm scanning through the test entries to see which components are covered. DealHeader has entries DDP-HDR-01 through DDP-HDR-04, StagePipeline has DDP-PIP-01 and DDP-PIP-02, and I can see DealHistorySection, DealMetricsSection, and WritupsSection all have corresponding test entries as well.\n\nLooking at the remaining sections, TasksSection has DDP-LTK-01 through DDP-LTK-05, AttachmentsSection has DDP-ATT-01 through DDP-ATT-05, and ContactsSection has DDP-CON-01 and DDP-CON-02. But I'm noticing the breadcrumb navigation at the top of the page—Deals / DealName—doesn't seem to have a test entry assigned to it, which might be something I've overlooked.\n\nNow I'm checking the navigation targets for the clickable elements. The task detail navigation goes to /tasks/:taskId, the contact navigation for Jane Smith goes to /individuals/<individualId>, and the file download is working as expected. For the mutations, I can see that the client field editing persists the change, and the deal history entries are being created along with the corresponding timeline entries.\n\nLooking at the timeline and writeup mutations, those are all creating the necessary history entries and persisting changes correctly. For the value editing, the spec only tracks stage changes in the history section, so not creating a history entry for other field changes seems right. Task completion is also persisting the status change and creating the timeline entry as expected.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the button and control appearance, starting with the edit and version history icons for the writeup section.\n\nFor the modals, I need to verify that all three are properly tested—the writeup modal with its save and cancel buttons, the task modal for creating new tasks, and the attachment modal with its file upload versus link URL toggle option.\n\nLooking at the attachment functionality specifically, I notice the test spec covers the toggle between file upload and link modes, but there's no explicit test case validating that actual file uploads work end-to-end. The current entries focus on the link URL path rather than testing the file upload path itself. Directive 9 about import dialogs doesn't apply here since the UploadAttachmentModal handles file uploads rather than imports, and there are no import dialogs specified for the DealDetailPage. Directive 10 on backend integrations also doesn't apply since there are no webhooks involved. For Directive 11, I'm verifying that state-changing actions propagate correctly — the timeline entries, task appearances, and attachment visibility across related pages all check out.\n\nNow I'm noticing a gap: the breadcrumb navigation (\"Deals / {DealName}\") isn't covered by any test entry. The breadcrumb is clickable and navigates to /deals, but DDP-HDR-01 only documents the title text, not the breadcrumb itself. This looks like a violation of Directive 4 since clickable navigation elements should have explicit test coverage specifying their exact targets.\n\nThere's also a mismatch with DDP-ATT-03 — the test title says \"Uploading a file\" but the actual action only tests link URL mode, not file upload mechanics. Directive 8 requires attachment functionality to support file uploads, so there should be a separate test entry that exercises the actual file picker and upload flow, not just entering a link URL.\n\nSo I've identified two directive violations: the missing breadcrumb test entry and the incomplete attachment testing. Now let me move on to Job 2 and check the DealDetailPage components against the writeApp.md directives, starting with visual appearance matching against the mockup. — path parsing. Now I'm reviewing the remaining guidelines: modals should use searchable dropdowns instead of text inputs for entity references, navigation menus can't have duplicate links, filter controls need custom dropdowns rather than native HTML selects, attachments require file-type icons or thumbnails, and any attachment UI must include actual file upload functionality. I'm checking the DealDetailPage and DealDetailHeader components to verify they have the required data-testid attributes.\n\nNow I'm verifying the DealDetailHeader is using FilterSelect instead of native selects and that it implements searchable dropdowns for the owner field when users are available. Moving on to check the StagePipeline component's test IDs.\n\nChecking the visual indicators in the pipeline stages and progress bar elements. The DealHistorySection just needs basic container and entry identifiers since there's no interactivity there. For the DealMetricsSection, I'm confirming all the edit, save, and cancel buttons are properly identified along with the input fields for probability and close date.\n\nThe probability and close date inputs use native HTML number and date inputs rather than custom dropdowns, so they don't fall under the filter dropdown directive. Moving to WriteupsSection now — I notice the inline edit form's save and cancel buttons on lines 88-98 are missing data-testid attributes, which could be a problem if E2E tests need to interact with them. The test code for DDP-WRT-04 and DDP-WRT-05 doesn't actually exercise the save flow, which means the save and cancel buttons lack data-testid attributes in violation of the interactive element requirement. Moving to LinkedTasksSection.tsx, I see most elements are properly tagged, but the clickable task title div on line 66 that navigates to the task detail page is missing its own data-testid.\n\nThe test DDP-LTK-05 relies on a fragile `.locator('.flex-1')` selector instead of a proper testid for clicking the task text area. Now checking DealAttachmentsSection.tsx, which has solid coverage with testids for the section, upload button, empty state, and individual attachment actions, plus proper use of the AttachmentPreview component for file icons and type labels. Moving into DealContactsSection.tsx next. Continuing through the remaining modals—AddDealTaskModal finishes up with the due date and priority fields using FilterSelect instead of native selects, then UploadAttachmentModal covers file and link upload options with proper testids, though the file upload on save needs attention.\n\nI'm noticing the file upload is using `URL.createObjectURL` to create a temporary blob URL, which won't persist after a page reload since blob URLs are session-specific. The directive requires actual file uploads via UploadThing according to the tech stack, so saving a blob URL to the database defeats that requirement—the file needs to be uploaded through UploadThing first before storing the persistent URL.\n\nNow checking the VersionHistoryModal component, which has the proper test IDs and only includes a close button with no other interactive elements. Moving to the backend, the deal-detail.ts file correctly uses tagged template literals for queries and handles empty string to null conversions appropriately—using `||` for date fields and `??` for non-date fields like description and size.\n\nFor the UUID casting on deal_id parameters, the frontend validation prevents empty strings from being sent, so while the database would reject them anyway, this isn't a practical concern in the current implementation.\n\nNow I'm checking the path parsing logic — the function splits the URL path and extracts the resource type and ID from specific indices, so for a path like `/.netlify/functions/deal-detail/writeups/123`, it correctly identifies 'writeups' as the resource and '123' as the resource ID.\n\nLooking at the violations in the second job, I'm noticing the WriteupsSection component is missing data-testid attributes on the save and cancel buttons for inline editing, and the task title click area also lacks proper test identifiers which makes the E2E tests fragile. There's also an issue with the UploadAttachmentModal using temporary blob URLs instead of persisting files through a proper upload service like UploadThing. a real bug. But I'm checking directives specifically from writeApp.md, not AGENTS.md.\n\nLooking at writeApp.md directive: \"Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\"\n\nThe UI does have a file picker. The issue is that the file isn't truly uploaded to persistent storage. The directive focuses on the UI mechanism (file picker exists ✓), not the backend storage. So this might not be a strict violation of this specific directive. But it's definitely a functional issue.\n\nLet me be conservative and note it as a violation since the file upload doesn't actually work (blob URL doesn't persist).\n\nActually let me re-read the directive one more time: \"must include a working file upload mechanism\". The key word is \"working\". If the file picker creates a blob URL that doesn't persist, then the mechanism isn't truly working — so this is a violation.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the DealDetailPage tests against the writeTests.md directives. I need to verify that navigation assertions check actual URLs or page content, that side effects are tested both for occurrence and frequency, that getByText() isn't used with overly common words, that data-testid values are consistent across test files, and that file upload tests actually verify the upload functionality.\n\nLooking through the test file, I can see DDP-CON-02 properly asserts the URL after clicking View Profile, and DDP-LTK-05 checks the URL after clicking a task.\n\nBut there are some gaps in side effects verification. DDP-HDR-04 changes the deal stage but doesn't verify that a history entry was created, even though the spec requires it. Similarly, DDP-LTK-03 creates a task without checking for the timeline entry, and DDP-LTK-04 toggles task completion without verifying the timeline side effect. Let me check if DDP-HIS-02 handles this properly.\n\nActually, DDP-HIS-02 does verify that changing stage creates a history entry, so that coverage exists separately. But the directive is pretty clear — each test performing a mutation should verify both the primary effect and its side effects in the same test. Having them split across tests is riskier because you could pass the primary action test while the side effect test fails, creating a false sense of security. So I should flag these as violations where the side effect assertions are missing.\n\nMore importantly, DDP-LTK-03 and DDP-LTK-04 don't verify timeline entries at all — there's no test checking that creating a task from deal detail actually produces a timeline entry on the client. Those are clear violations of the directive.\n\nNow I'm checking for getByText usage in the test file to see if common words are being used unsafely. Looking at the test specs, DDP-ATT-02 expects the upload modal to display with both toggle options and file input visible by default, which the test does verify. However, DDP-ATT-03 only tests the Link URL mode switch without actually validating a file upload scenario using `setInputFiles`, so there's a gap in coverage for the actual file upload functionality. as a violation, but the test entry itself only specifies verifying the dialog opens with the right elements, not actually uploading a file, so it's not technically a violation of the directive.\n\nNow I'm checking for `.toPass()` usage with auto-wait functionality in the test file. Looking at DDP-HIS-02, I can see a test that's checking whether new deal history entries appear after an action, using a locator to count entries before and after...\n\nExamining the test logic...\n\nThe test is using `.count()` inside `.toPass()` to verify that matching entries exist. The directive warns against putting auto-wait locator calls inside `.toPass()` retry blocks, but I need to clarify whether `.count()` actually auto-waits — it resolves immediately without retrying, so this might not be a violation of the directive as written. I'm realizing the distinction here — `count()` itself doesn't auto-wait and returns immediately, so it's safe to call in `.toPass()`. But the real problem in the bad example is the loop that follows: iterating through elements with `nth(i).textContent()` inside `.toPass()` creates the deadlock because each iteration waits for actionability, and if the DOM keeps changing, it never stabilizes.\n\nThe DDP-HIS-02 code doesn't have that loop — it just uses `count()` on a filtered locator to check if a matching entry exists. Since there's no iteration with inner auto-wait calls, this pattern should be acceptable even though it uses `count()` inside `.toPass()`.\n\nLooking at DDP-CON-01, the test chains multiple `.filter()` calls with `hasNotText` to work around an imprecise locator selector. The `[data-testid^=\"deal-contact-\"]` pattern matches too broadly, catching unwanted elements like `deal-contact-view-profile-{id}` and `deal-contact-empty`, so the filters are necessary but indicate the testid pattern itself could be more specific.\n\nDDP-WRT-05 is a clear violation — it only checks that a section is visible but doesn't actually perform the action described in the spec (editing a writeup and verifying version history is created). The test claims coverage through other tests, which isn't sufficient.\n\nDDP-LTK-04 has a similar issue where it verifies a task toggle happened but only checks that taskText exists, not that the task actually shows completion indicators like strikethrough styling.\n\nLooking at the full picture, I'm finding violations across both files: missing test entries for breadcrumb navigation and file uploads in the spec, plus missing data-testid attributes on interactive elements in the implementation, and some incomplete modal implementations.\n\nIn the test file, several tests are either stubs or missing critical verifications for side effects like history entries and timeline updates after state changes.\n\nNow I'm organizing these violations into fix groups: missing data-testid attributes on interactive elements, the file upload implementation that needs to actually use UploadThing, a missing breadcrumb test spec entry, and the incomplete test coverage for side effects across multiple test cases.\n\nThe file upload situation is interesting—the directive requires a working upload mechanism, and while there's a file picker UI, the current implementation only creates a blob URL rather than persisting the file, so this is a legitimate functional gap that needs addressing. The File Upload mode in the modal works within a single session but fails to persist across page reloads since blob URLs don't survive navigation — this violates the writeApp.md directive requiring actual file uploads. Given that AGENTS.md explicitly requires UploadThing for file storage, this needs to be addressed as a tech stack compliance issue rather than an intentional simplification.\n\nFor the fix groups, I'm focusing on practical, scoped improvements: adding missing data-testid attributes to the DealDetailPage components like the WriteupsSection edit buttons and LinkedTasksSection task areas, then running tests to verify they work.\n\nNext, I need to add test coverage for the breadcrumb navigation since it's currently missing from the test documentation, and I should also fix the existing DealDetailPage tests to properly assert side effects like writeup edits and completion state changes.\n\nThe file upload issue is significant enough to warrant its own fix group — I'll document it as a violation that needs UploadThing integration rather than skipping it. I need to include all violations in fix groups rather than skipping the file upload one, even though it's more involved. So I'm organizing everything into three focused groups: one combining the missing test IDs and breadcrumb test, another for fixing the side effect assertions, and a third specifically for the breadcrumb documentation and test. ModalModal blob URL issue, add a file upload test entry, and run tests to verify everything works. Actually, let me reconsider the approach—I should organize these as four distinct fix groups, each with its own test run: one for missing data-testid attributes, another for strengthening weak test assertions, a third for the breadcrumb test coverage, and a fourth for the file upload persistence issue. Though I'm second-guessing whether the file upload fix is feasible given the UploadThing integration complexity.\n\nLet me check if UploadThing is already configured in the

This is the same pattern across the app. Given this, the file upload issue is a known app-wide limitation, not specific to the DealDetailPage.

The test uses `waitForTimeout(300)` which is fragile. Weak but not a strict directive violation.\n\n### Checking DDP-WRT-05 test (line 451)\n- **VIOLATION**: This test is a **stub**. The comment says \"This test is covered by the combination of DDP-WRT-04 and DDP-WRT-06\" but the test body only verifies the section is visible. It does NOT actually edit a writeup and verify a version history entry is created. The test spec says \"Editing a writeup creates a version history entry\" — the test must perform the edit, save it, and verify the version history shows at least 2 versions. (Directive 2: side effects)\n\n### Checking DDP-WRT-06 test (line 460)\n- Clicks Version History button, checks modal visible with \"Version History\" text — **OK** (when writeups exist)\n\n### Checking DDP-LTK-01 test (line 481)\n- Checks section visible, Add Task button — **OK**\n\n### Checking DDP-LTK-02 test (line 493)\n- Opens modal, checks form fields, save/cancel — **OK**\n\n### Checking DDP-LTK-03 test (line 516)\n- Creates task, verifies it appears in section — **OK** for primary effect\n- **VIOLATION**: Does NOT verify timeline entry is created. Test spec says \"A timeline entry is created on both the deal and client.\" (Directive 2: side effects)\n\n### Checking DDP-LTK-04 test (line 536)\n- Creates task, toggles it, then just checks \"taskText is truthy\" — very weak assertion\n- **VIOLATION**: Does NOT verify the task is marked as completed (e.g., checking for strikethrough class, \"Completed\" text, or checked checkbox state). Does NOT verify timeline entry. (Directives 1 & 2)\n\n### Checking DDP-LTK-05 test (line 568)\n- Clicks task text, verifies URL contains /tasks/ — **OK** (Directive 1: navigation target verified)\n- Uses `.locator('.flex-1')` to target the click area — this is fragile but works given no data-testid exists (component issue, not test issue)\n\n### Checking DDP-ATT-01 test (line 585)\n- Checks section visible, upload button — **OK**\n\n### Checking DDP-ATT-02 test (line 596)\n- Opens modal, checks toggle buttons, file input visible, cancels — **OK**\n\n### Checking DDP-ATT-03 test (line 617)\n- Tests link mode only (enters link name + URL) — matches the test spec entry (which also specifies link mode)\n- No violation of writeTests.md since the test matches the spec entry\n\n### Checking DDP-ATT-04 test (line 640)\n- Checks download link visible, has href — **OK**\n\n### Checking DDP-ATT-05 test (line 656)\n- Creates attachment, deletes it, confirms dialog, verifies removal — **OK**\n\n### Checking DDP-CON-01 test (line 696)\n- Checks contacts or empty state, View Profile links — **OK**\n\n### Checking DDP-CON-02 test (line 720)\n- Clicks View Profile, verifies URL contains /individuals/ — **OK** (Directive 1)\n\n### Checking for getByText usage (Directive 3)\n- No `getByText()` usage found in the test file — all element targeting uses `getByTestId` or locator selectors — **OK**\n\n### Checking for .toPass() violations (Directive 6)\n- One `.toPass()` usage in DDP-HIS-02 — no nested loop/iteration, safe pattern — **OK**\n\n### writeTests.md Violations Found:\n\n1. **DDP-HDR-04 missing side effect verification** — Stage change test doesn't verify deal history entry or client timeline entry is created. (Directive 2)\n2. **DDP-WRT-05 is a stub test** — Doesn't actually test that editing a writeup creates a version history entry. Just checks the section is visible. (Directive 2)\n3. **DDP-LTK-03 missing timeline verification** — Task creation test doesn't verify timeline entry. (Directive 2)\n4. **DDP-LTK-04 weak completion assertion** — Task toggle test only checks \"taskText is truthy\" — doesn't verify actual completion state or timeline entry.
