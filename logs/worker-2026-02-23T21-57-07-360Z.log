A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    30→\n    31→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    32→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    33→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    34→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    35→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    36→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    37→\n    38→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    39→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    40→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    41→\n    42→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    43→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    44→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    45→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    46→\n    47→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    48→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    49→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    50→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    51→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    52→\n    53→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    54→  ```ts\n    55→  await expect(async () => {\n    56→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    57→    const count = await cards.count();\n    58→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    59→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    60→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    61→    }\n    62→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    63→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    64→  ```\n    65→\n    66→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    67→  ```ts\n    68→  await expect(\n    69→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    70→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    71→  ```\n    72→\n    73→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    74→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    79→\n    80→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    81→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    82→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    83→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n    84→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n    85→\n    86→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    87→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    88→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    89→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    90→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    91→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    92→\n    93→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n    94→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n    95→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n    96→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n    97→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n    98→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n    99→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   100→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   101→\n   102→## Parallel Test Design\n   103→\n   104→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   105→Write tests with this in mind:\n   106→\n   107→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   108→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   109→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   110→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\").

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":131,"startLine":1,"totalLines":131}}}

Other links have the default transparent background.\n\n#### Active link updates on sub-routes\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /clients/123 (a client detail page).\n- **Expected:** The \"Clients\" link in the sidebar is highlighted as the active link, since the route is a sub-route of /clients.\n\n#### Sidebar is persistent across all pages\n- **Initial state:** User navigates between different pages (Clients, Deals, Tasks, etc.).\n- **Expected:** The sidebar remains visible and in the same position on every page. The sidebar width is consistent (approximately 244px). Navigation links remain functional throughout.\n\n### SidebarUserArea\n\n#### Sign In button shown when not logged in\n- **Initial state:** User is not authenticated (no active session).\n- **Expected:** The sidebar user area (below the app title) displays a \"Sign In\" button. No avatar, user name, or sign-out option is visible.\n\n#### Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form\n- **Initial state:** User is not authenticated.

The form replaces or expands below the \"Sign In\" button.\n\n#### Sign In form submits with email and password\n- **Initial state:** The inline auth form is open in Sign In mode.\n- **Action:** User enters a valid email and password into the form fields and clicks the \"Sign In\" submit button.\n- **Expected:** The form submits the credentials. On success, the user is authenticated: the inline form is replaced by the user's avatar, display name, and a sign-out button. On failure (invalid credentials), an error message is displayed inline near the form.\n\n#### Forgot password link navigates to /auth/forgot-password\n- **Initial state:** The inline auth form is open in Sign In mode.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Forgot password?\" link.\n- **Expected:** The browser navigates to /auth/forgot-password, displaying the ForgotPasswordPage where the user can enter their email to receive a password reset link.\n\n#### Toggle switches between Sign In and Sign Up modes\n- **Initial state:** The inline auth form is open in Sign In mode.\n- **Action:** User clicks the Sign In/Sign Up toggle.\n- **Expected:** The form switches to Sign Up mode. The submit button text changes to \"Sign Up\". The toggle text updates to indicate the user can switch back to Sign In mode. The email and password fields remain visible.\n\n#### Sign Up form submits and requires email confirmation\n- **Initial state:** The inline auth form is open in Sign Up mode.\n- **Action:** User enters a new email and password and clicks the \"Sign Up\" submit button.\n- **Expected:** The form submits the registration. A message is displayed informing the user that a confirmation email has been sent and they must confirm their email before logging in. The user is not yet authenticated. (In test mode with IS_TEST=true, signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.)\n\n#### Logged in state shows avatar, name, and sign-out\n- **Initial state:** User is authenticated with an active session.\n- **Expected:** The sidebar user area displays the user's avatar (or initials), the user's display name, and a sign-out button or icon. The \"Sign In\" button is not visible.\n\n#### Clicking sign-out logs the user out\n- **Initial state:** User is authenticated. The sidebar shows avatar, name, and sign-out.\n- **Action:** User clicks the sign-out button.\n- **Expected:** The user's session is ended. The sidebar user area reverts to showing the \"Sign In\" button. The avatar and name are no longer displayed. The app continues to function in unauthenticated mode (all pages remain accessible).\n\n## ClientsListPage (/clients)\n\n## ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n\n## PersonDetailPage (/individuals/:individualId)\n\n## DealsListPage (/deals)\n\n## DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)\n\n## TasksListPage (/tasks)\n\n## TaskDetailPage (/tasks/:taskId)\n\n## ContactsListPage (/contacts)\n\n## SettingsPage (/settings)\n\n## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n\n## UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n\n## ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n\n## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n","numLines":122,"startLine":1,"totalLines":122}}}

The test entries are only under \"Sidebar Navigation\" section - the other pages are empty (no test entries). Let me organize the test entries by page/section:\n\n**Sidebar Navigation** has two component groups:\n1. SidebarNavLinks (9 test entries)\n2. SidebarUserArea (8 test entries)\n\nAll other pages have no test entries.\n\nSo I need to unpack this into groups. Since all tests are under \"Sidebar Navigation\", I'll create groups for SidebarNavLinks and SidebarUserArea.\n\nLet me create the add-group commands. The strategy says \"Add one group per page\" - Sidebar Navigation is one \"page\" area. But the tests are split between two components. Let me re-read the strategy:\n\n\nThe strategy means I should create one group per page section in the tests.md file. Since only Sidebar Navigation has test entries, I'll create a single group for that entire page with all 17 tests. I'm seeing the remaining test entries for the user area section, bringing the total to 18 tests across both navigation and authentication components. The strategy calls for one group per page, so I should consolidate all these Sidebar Navigation tests into a single group rather than splitting them by sub-section.\n\nNow I need to format the test entry names properly using the `WriteTest<TestEntry>: Write test for <TestEntry>` pattern and clean them up into good identifiers for the command.","signature":"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
