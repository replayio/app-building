Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    97→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    98→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    99→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   100→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   101→\n   102→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   103→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   104→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   105→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   106→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   107→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   108→\n   109→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   110→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   111→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   112→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   113→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   114→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   115→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Tests across\n   124→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   125→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   126→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   127→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   128→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   129→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   130→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   131→  being unmodified.\n   132→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   133→  you need to interact with.\n   134→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`.

I need to read the test spec and create subtasks for each test entry, grouped by page. Let me organize them.\n\nThe test spec has test entries organized by pages:\n1. DashboardPage (/) - with QuickActions, UpcomingOrdersTable, SuppliersList sections\n2. SupplierDetailsPage (/suppliers/:supplierId) - with SupplierOverview, DocumentsTab, CommentsSection, OrdersSection\n3. OrderDetailsPage (/orders/:orderId) - with OrderSummary, LineItemsTable, CostBreakdown, OrderDocuments, OrderHistory\n\n\n4. DashboardPage contains 10 test entries covering the QuickActions section, including button displays, dialog interactions, form validation, and state management for both supplier and order creation flows.\n\nNow I'm continuing through the remaining test entries for the page. The UpcomingOrdersTable section has 13 tests covering table display, column structure, data rendering, navigation links, status styling, filtering functionality with multiple filter combinations, empty states, and proper formatting for currency and dates. The SuppliersList section begins with tests for the heading, grid layout, and individual card components that display supplier information like name, status, and contact details.\n\nMoving into the SupplierDetailsPage, I'm checking the SupplierOverview component which validates the supplier name, address, contact info, description, and status badge display, plus navigation and action buttons for editing and deleting. The DocumentsTab tests cover displaying document cards, searching functionality, and document actions like viewing and downloading. The CommentsSection test is starting but appears incomplete.\n\nContinuing with the CommentsSection, I need to verify the comment header displays the count, the comment list shows timestamps and authors, users can add comments through an input field that persists after reload, and the section can collapse and expand with validation for empty comments. The OrdersSection tests check both upcoming and historical order tabs with proper table columns, data display, ID navigation links, search and filter functionality, and status badges. Finally, I'm moving into the OrderDetailsPage which starts with the OrderSummary component displaying the order ID and supplier name.\n\nNow I'm laying out the remaining OrderDetailsPage tests covering the order summary details like date and delivery information, status badges, costs, and action buttons for editing and printing. The LineItemsTable section tests the table structure, row data, and CRUD operations for line items. The CostBreakdown verifies subtotal, tax with percentage, discounts, and total cost display that updates dynamically. The OrderDocuments section handles displaying, viewing, downloading, and uploading documents. Finally, the OrderHistory section tests the event timeline with timestamps, descriptions, icons, and entries that get created when status changes or line items are modified.\n\nI need to organize these into three separate tasks—one per page—with all the test entries grouped together. The naming convention for each subtask should follow the pattern of \"WriteTest\" plus the test entry title, then describe what test is being written. Let me structure the three add-task commands carefully to capture all the tests for each
