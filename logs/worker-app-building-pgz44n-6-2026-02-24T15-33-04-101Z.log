The \"resolve merge conflicts\" commits only added logs and task queue entries. There are no actual code changes since the merge.\n\nLet me understand what happened:\n1. The merge (5ae8f03) merged origin/main into sales-crm-2, resolving conflicts with --theirs\n2. The local branch (sales-crm-2) had app-building work (SalesCRM app)\n3. origin/main had infrastructure changes (renaming strategies to skills, etc.)\n\nThe key question is: did the --theirs resolution overwrite any local SalesCRM app changes? Let me check what the local branch had before the merge vs what exists now.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":125,"cache_read_input_tokens":29540,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":125,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5ca525ff-61b1-406c-b32f-4e0d03f0e38d","uuid":"f67a3997-7ab4-44bb-8399-7ddf9877ab36"}

Let me re-check. The diff I saw earlier showed all the SalesCRM files as being deleted, but they're still present. Let me check git status more carefully.\n\nActually, let me re-read the diff output. The diff was between `09084a2` (the local parent before the merge) and `321dec5` (the remote/main parent). That diff shows what's different between the two parents - it doesn't necessarily mean all those files were deleted in the merge result.\n\nWhen you do `git merge --theirs`, it resolves conflicts by taking the remote version. But files that exist only on one side (not conflicting) would still be present in the merge result.\n \nHold on - `git merge` doesn't actually have a `--theirs` flag directly. The right approach is `git merge -X theirs` to resolve conflicts in favor of the remote version, though non-conflicting changes from both sides still get included.

The local branch only modified files inside `apps/SalesCRM/` and some log/job files. \n\nThe `--theirs` resolution for AGENTS.md, README.md, etc. would have taken the main version, which is the updated one with the new naming scheme. This is correct behavior since the local branch didn't need to modify these infrastructure files.\n\nLet me now check if the current state of the repo is healthy. Let me verify the current AGENTS.md, key skill files, etc. \n\nNow I need to make sure everything is intact and then run the check command in the SalesCRM app directory to validate the setup.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1547,"cache_read_input_tokens":41005,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1547,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5ca525ff-61b1-406c-b32f-4e0d03f0e38d","uuid":"df380eec-2bbc-45d0-bdf0-5d356a30faca"}
