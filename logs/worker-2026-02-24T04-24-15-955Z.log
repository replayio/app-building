You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of strategies and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `strategies/messages`: Strategies for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `strategies/tasks`: Strategies for performing tasks. See `strategies/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant strategy files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `strategies/messages/` and read any strategy\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `strategy`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `tasks.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same strategy. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

Source Batch ID is left empty.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"+ Add Quantity Transfer\".\n- **Expected:** A new row is added to the table without a Source Batch ID. The Source Batch ID column for this row is empty or shows \"N/A\". The transfer is valid without a batch reference.\n\n#### Test: Add Quantity Transfer with missing required fields shows validation\n- **Components:** QuantityTransfersList\n- **Initial state:** User is on `/transactions/new`. The inline form has only Source Account selected; Destination Account, Amount, and unit are not filled.\n- **Action:** User clicks \"+ Add Quantity Transfer\".\n- **Expected:** Validation errors appear indicating that Destination Account and Amount are required.

Basic Info is filled. Quantity transfers total 500 kg debit and 500 kg credit (balanced transfers). Batch allocations total 200 Units for one material — but these batch amounts are not balanced against any corresponding transfer.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Post\" button.\n- **Expected:** A validation error is displayed indicating that the total debits must equal total credits across all quantity transfers and batch allocations. The transaction is not saved until the double-entry equation balances.\n\n#### Test: Successful Post with balanced debits and credits\n- **Components:** BatchAllocationList, QuantityTransfersList, BasicInfoForm\n- **Initial state:** User is on `/transactions/new`. Basic Info is filled (Date: 2024-05-23, Reference ID: TRX-20240523-001, Description: \"Q2 Inventory Adjustment\", Type: Transfer). Quantity transfers are added that balance correctly. Batch allocations are added with matching amounts. Total debits equal total credits.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Post\" button.\n- **Expected:** The transaction is created and persisted. User is redirected to the TransactionDetailPage for the new transaction. The detail page shows all entered data: Basic Info fields, Quantity Transfers with source/destination accounts and amounts, and Batches Created with material and quantity. The new batches are created in the system and appear on their respective material detail pages. The new transaction appears in the TransactionsPage list and in the Recent Transactions on the Dashboard.\n\n#### Test: Newly created batches record lineage from source batches\n- **Components:** BatchAllocationList, QuantityTransfersList\n- **Initial state:** User is on `/transactions/new`. A quantity transfer references Source Batch ID \"BATCH-RM-A-001\". A new batch is created in the Batch Allocation section.\n- **Action:** User posts the transaction successfully.\n- **Expected:** The newly created batch's BatchDetailPage shows lineage information linking back to the source batch \"BATCH-RM-A-001\" and the originating transaction. The source batch's usage history is updated to include this transaction.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":2000,"totalLines":2164}}}
