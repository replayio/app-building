Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ecf4880a-03e3-406e-bdd1-77529a0ef7fe","uuid":"14a0509e-0ad5-4753-832e-dc45d9ab9082","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links.

The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email).

A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button.

Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ecf4880a-03e3-406e-bdd1-77529a0ef7fe","uuid":"5dece4c8-07be-483d-b7bc-ae0fc1b2c46b","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

The outer container (`.ezxFuW`) is a single-column grid where each child is a full-width row.\n\n```css\n/* Outer list container */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr;   /* single column, full-width rows */\ngrid-template-rows: 36px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 44px 308px;\n                  /* ^group header  ^issue rows...                              ^spacer */\n```\n\n- **Group header row**: 36px tall\n- **Issue row**: 44px tall\n- The list container has 14 children: 1 group header + 12 issue rows + 1 spacer\n\n### Issue Row Structure\n\nEach issue row is an `<a>` tag (the full row is clickable) wrapping an inner grid `<div>` with **7 named grid columns**:\n\n| Column       | Content Example          | Font Size | Font Weight | Color             |\n|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| `checkbox`   | (empty/checkbox)         | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `priority`   | (priority icon)          | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `identifier` | \"PRO-1247\", \"TT-38\"     | 13px      | 450         | rgb(91, 91, 93)   |\n| `status`     | (status icon)            | —         | —           | —                 |\n| `title`      | \"Contact form not working\" | 13px    | 500         | rgb(26, 26, 26)   |\n| `created`    | (date/avatar info)       | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n| (additional) | (assignee, labels, etc.) | varies    | varies      | varies            |\n\nKey observations:\n- **Identifier** uses muted color `rgb(91, 91, 93)` / `#5b5b5d` with semi-bold weight 450\n- **Title** uses primary color `rgb(26, 26, 26)` / `#1a1a1a` with medium weight 500\n- Both use 13px font size (not the body 16px)\n- The grid uses **named column tracks** (`checkbox`, `priority`, `identifier`, `status`, `title`, `created`) for semantic column placement\n\n### Issue Row Styling\n\n```css\n/* Issue row (A tag) */\ndisplay: grid;\ngrid-column: 1 / -1;      /* spans full width */\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 44px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nborder: none;              /* 0px none — no visible row borders */\ncursor: default;\ntext-decoration: none;     /* no underline on the link */\noutline: none;             /* focus-visible override */\n```\n\n### Row Separation\n\nRows have **no visible borders** between them. Visual separation comes from:\n- Whitespace/padding within each 44px row\n- Group headers that break up the list\n- Hover state background change provides visual row boundary on interaction\n\n### Group Header (Section Divider)\n\n```css\ndisplay: grid;\nalign-items: center;\nheight: 36px;\npadding: 0px;\nbackground: transparent;\ncolor: rgb(26, 26, 26);\nfont-size: 16px;\nfont-weight: 400;\n```\n\nGroup headers contain section names (e.g., \"Other active\") with a count badge (\"19\").\n\n### Table Hover States\n\n| State             | Background               | Hex       |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Default           | `transparent`            | —         |\n| Row hover         | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)`  | ~6% black |\n| Row active/press  | `rgb(239, 239, 239)`     | `#efefef` |\n| Alt hover (light) | `rgb(245, 245, 245)`     | `#f5f5f5` |\n| Alt hover (mid)   | `rgb(247, 247, 247)`     | `#f7f7f7` |\n| Selected row      | `rgb(237, 237, 237)`     | `#ededed` |\n\nAll hover backgrounds observed in stylesheets:\n- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)` — primary interactive hover\n- `rgb(239, 239, 239)` — pressed/active\n- `rgb(245, 245, 245)` — sidebar hover\n- `rgb(247, 247, 247)` — light hover\n- `rgb(237, 237, 237)` — selected state\n- `transparent` — reset/clear hover\n\n---\n\n## Sidebar Navigation Items\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-radius: var(--control-border-radius, 4px);\nheight: 28px;\npadding: 0px;\nfont-size: 13px;\nfont-weight: 450;\ncolor: rgb(45, 46, 47);\nbackground: transparent;\n```\n\n### Hover / Active States\n\n| State   | Background         | Description                |\n|---------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Default | transparent        | No background              |\n| Hover   | rgb(247, 247, 247) | `#f7f7f7` — subtle gray    |\n| Active  | rgb(238, 238, 238) | `#eeeeee` — slightly darker|\n\nThe hover transition uses `var(--speed-highlightFadeIn)` for a fast, smooth appearance.\n\n---\n\n## Borders\n\n| Pattern                              | Usage                    |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| `1px solid var(--bg-border-color)`   | Default dividers         |\n| `1px solid var(--normal-border)`     | Input/control borders    |\n| `1px solid var(--gray4)`             | Subtle separators        |\n\nActive border color resolves to approximately `#dcdcdc`.\nHover border uses `var(--normal-border-hover)` and `var(--gray5)` for a slightly darker state.\n\n---\n\n## Border Radius\n\n| Value                              | Usage                     |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| `var(--control-border-radius)` 4px | Buttons, inputs, nav items|\n| 6px                                | Cards, larger containers  |\n| 8px                                | Modals, panels            |\n| 50%                                | Avatars, circular icons   |\n\n---\n\n## Shadows\n\n| Level      | Value                                                                |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Elevation 1| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px`                                   |\n| Elevation 2| `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 4px 12px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px` |\n\nShadows are very subtle and use low-opacity black.

ContactsListContent (this is the page-level component)\n\nFollowing the strategy's pattern for adding groups, I need to create WriteComponent jobs for each of these components plus the page itself using the add-group command with the writeApp strategy.\n\nNow I should check what components already exist to avoid duplicating any work.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":12862,"cache_read_input_tokens":40554,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":12862,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ecf4880a-03e3-406e-bdd1-77529a0ef7fe","uuid":"7a9f6f30-8ce9-4621-b30c-9fb54eb48f6c"}

The individualsSlice references `/.netlify/functions/individuals` but the function doesn't exist. The ContactsListPage is a stub. There's an `individualsSlice.ts` with search and pagination state already set up.\n\nFor the ContactsListPage, per docs/tests.md the components are:\n1. ContactsSearchBar\n2. ContactsTable\n3. CreateContactModal\n4. ContactsListContent\n\nAnd looking at the Tasks page for reference (which is already built), the pattern includes:\n- Components in `src/components/Tasks/`\n- A page in `src/pages/TasksListPage.tsx`\n\n\nI need to follow the same pattern for contacts—building the backend individuals function alongside the four components and the page itself. I need to verify that the backend API functions exist for individuals, and check whether similar functions are needed for clients and deals—they might be in different locations or not yet created.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":120,"cache_read_input_tokens":56945,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":120,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ecf4880a-03e3-406e-bdd1-77529a0ef7fe","uuid":"b20f9183-35cd-4617-90d6-c3dcdb3e41fd"}
