This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   242→\n   243→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   244→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   245→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   246→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   247→\n   248→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   249→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   250→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   251→\n   252→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   253→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   254→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   255→\n   256→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   257→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   258→\n   259→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   260→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   261→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   262→\n   263→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   264→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   265→\n   266→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   267→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   268→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   269→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   270→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   271→\n   272→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   273→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   274→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   275→\n   276→## Tips\n   277→\n   278→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   279→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   280→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   281→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   282→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   283→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   284→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   285→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   286→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   287→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   288→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   289→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   290→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   291→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   292→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   293→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   294→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   295→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   296→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   297→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   298→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   299→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   300→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   301→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   302→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   303→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   304→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   305→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   306→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   307→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   308→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   309→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   310→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   311→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   312→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   313→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify).

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n- When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` database columns, expect formatted output in\n  assertions (e.g., `\"500\"` not `\"500.00\"`). These column types return decimal strings from\n  PostgreSQL, so the app must format them before display. If tests fail on numeric values,\n  check the column type and app formatting layer before modifying test expectations.\n","numLines":341,"startLine":1,"totalLines":341}}}

Looking at the StatusPage section of tests.md:\n\n**Existing tests (4):**\n1. `ActiveContainers: Shows pending container after spawn` - exists but uses mock instead of actual endpoint\n2. `WebhookHelpButton: Curl commands use actual site URL` - exists\n3. `WebhookHelpButton: Curl copy buttons exist` - exists\n4. `WebhookHelpButton: Endpoint URL copy buttons exist` - exists\n\n**All spec entries for StatusPage:**\n\n### BackLink (2):\n1. BackLink: Visible in header\n\n\n2. BackLink: Navigates to MainPage on click\n\n### DefaultPromptDisplay (3):\n3. DefaultPromptDisplay: Displays section title\n4. DefaultPromptDisplay: Shows configured prompt text\n5. DefaultPromptDisplay: Shows placeholder when no prompt configured\n\n### ActiveContainers (9):\n6. ActiveContainers: Displays section title\n7. ActiveContainers: Shows table with columns when containers exist\n8. ActiveContainers: Shows container name in table row\n9. ActiveContainers: Shows container status with styling\n10. ActiveContainers: Shows container prompt\n11. ActiveContainers: Shows dash for missing prompt\n12. ActiveContainers: Shows pending container after spawn (**EXISTS but needs fix**), displays last event timestamp, and shows empty state when no containers exist\n\n### WebhookEventFeed (4):\n13. WebhookEventFeed: Displays section title with event items showing timestamp, container ID, event type, and payload summary, plus empty state handling\n\n### WebhookHelpButton (11):\n14. WebhookHelpButton: Visible on StatusPage, opens and closes help panel on click, and displays documentation for both app-builder-event and spawn-container endpoints\n15. WebhookHelpButton: Shows set-default-prompt endpoint documentation with accurate curl commands using the actual site URL\n16. WebhookHelpButton: Includes copy buttons for both curl commands and endpoint URLs (**EXISTS**)\n\nNow I'm tallying up the total spec entries: StatusPage has 2 + 3 + 9 + 4 + 11 = 29 entries, with only 4 existing tests, leaving 25 missing tests instead of the 24 mentioned in the task. Let me recount the existing tests to see where the discrepancy is.\n\nLooking at what's actually covered: ActiveContainers has one test for showing pending containers, and WebhookHelpButton has three tests for curl commands and copy buttons. The missing coverage is substantial—BackLink needs 2 tests, DefaultPromptDisplay needs 3, and ActiveContainers is missing 8 more tests for displaying the section title, table structure, container names, and status information. with styling\n- ActiveContainers: Shows container prompt\n- ActiveContainers: Shows dash for missing prompt\n- ActiveContainers: Shows last event timestamp\n- ActiveContainers: Shows empty state when no containers\n\nMissing from WebhookEventFeed (4 missing):\n- WebhookEventFeed: Displays section title\n- WebhookEventFeed: Shows event items with timestamp, container ID, and event type\n- WebhookEventFeed: Shows event payload summary\n- WebhookEventFeed: Shows empty state when no events\n\nMissing from WebhookHelpButton (8 missing):\n- WebhookHelpButton: Visible on StatusPage\n- WebhookHelpButton: Opens help panel on click\n- WebhookHelpButton: Closes help panel\n- WebhookHelpButton: Shows app-builder-event endpoint documentation\n- WebhookHelpButton: Shows spawn-container endpoint documentation\n- WebhookHelpButton: Shows set-default-prompt endpoint documentation\n- WebhookHelpButton: Example curl commands are accurate\n- WebhookHelpButton: Curl commands use actual site URL\n\nThat brings me to 24 total missing tests. For the fix, I need to update the \"Shows pending container after spawn\" test to call the actual spawn-container endpoint instead of using a mock, then I should review the spawn-container and status

A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n    30→\n    31→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    32→\n    33→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    34→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    35→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    36→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    37→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    38→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    39→\n    40→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    41→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    42→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    43→\n    44→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    45→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    46→  `setInputFiles` on a file input).

Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks.

Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n10. **Print summary** to stdout: a single line like `10 passed` or\n    `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`. Include the uploaded recording ID\n    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n\n11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: One-line summary only. Never verbose test output.\n- **`logs/test-run-N.log`**: Full Playwright output, recording metadata, and upload results.\n  `N` increments each run (find the highest existing number and add 1).\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON. The\n  `addMetadata` entries contain `metadata.test.result` which indicates pass/fail.\n- The Playwright config must use the Replay browser via `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n  from `@replayio/playwright` and include `replayReporter` with `upload: false`.\n- The HTML reporter must use `open: 'never'` to suppress the interactive \"Serving HTML report\"\n  prompt that blocks the script from exiting.\n- Run Playwright with `--retries 0` — no retries. Failures must be analyzed via Replay.\n- Do NOT inherit stdio from Playwright. Pipe stdout and stderr to the log file using\n  `child_process.execSync` with `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` or similar, then write\n  the captured output to the log file.\n- Use the JSON reporter (`test-results/results.json`) to parse pass/fail counts for the\n  summary line.\n- The `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` env var is already set in the container.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

The test runs with a dev server started by Playwright, but the spawn-container endpoint checks for `WEBHOOK_SECRET` from env. The test script creates an ephemeral Neon branch.\n\nLooking at the spawn-container function more carefully:\n1. It requires WEBHOOK_SECRET to be set\n2. It requires FLY_API_TOKEN and FLY_APP_NAME\n3. It inserts into the database\n4. It then calls spawn-container-background\n\nFor the test, I need to:\n\n\n1. Set WEBHOOK_SECRET in the env (or mock the endpoint behavior)\n2. Either mock the spawn-container-background or have it work\n\nThe spec is clear that I should call the actual POST endpoint, so I need to figure out how to handle the WEBHOOK_SECRET requirement and the background job that follows.\n\nThe real issue is that the spawn-container endpoint checks for FLY_API_TOKEN and FLY_APP_NAME in the environment, and returns a 500 error if they're missing. So I'll need to either set those credentials or mock the endpoint behavior for the test to work. says we must use the actual endpoint. The approach should be:\n1. Set WEBHOOK_SECRET in the environment for the test\n2. For FLY_API_TOKEN and FLY_APP_NAME, we may need to set dummy values too\n\nLooking at the spawn-container code flow more carefully, the webhook secret check happens early, then it validates the auth header, and only after that does it check for FLY_API_TOKEN and FLY_APP_NAME before inserting into the database. The actual Fly API call happens asynchronously in the background, so as long as those environment variables are set—even with dummy values—the database insert will succeed and the endpoint will return success since the background task is fire-and-forget.\n\nThe challenge is that the Playwright webServer config starts `npx netlify dev`, which needs to pick up these environment variables from the current process. test script sets up the database branch and environment, then runs playwright. So the env vars would need to be available when the test script runs.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about this differently.\n\nThe test spec says \"when a container is spawned via the POST endpoint\". The intent is to test that after calling the real endpoint, the status page shows the data. But we're in a test environment with an ephemeral database branch.\n\nOne approach: Instead of calling the actual spawn-container endpoint (which requires Fly credentials), we can make the test call the actual `/status` endpoint (no mock) after directly inserting test data. But the spec explicitly says \"via the POST /.netlify/functions/spawn-container endpoint\".\n\nAnother approach: Mock just the parts that need external services. We could route the spawn-container-background call to a mock so it doesn't try to hit Fly, set dummy credentials for the env vars, and call the real spawn-container endpoint. But the spawn-container function calls spawn-container-background as a server-to-server HTTP call within the same process, not through the browser, so page routes won't intercept it.\n\nThe real issue is that the server needs WEBHOOK_SECRET and FLY_API_TOKEN set in its environment for the endpoint to work properly. I need to call the spawn-container endpoint directly via HTTP rather than mocking it, which means the server needs WEBHOOK_SECRET, FLY_API_TOKEN, and FLY_APP_NAME set as environment variables. Since the test runs against the real dev server with an ephemeral database, these should be configured—let me check how the test script handles this

So any environment variables set in the current shell will be available to the dev server. But `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not set.\n\nFor the \"Shows pending container after spawn\" test to work with the actual endpoint, we need:\n1. `WEBHOOK_SECRET` to be set in the server environment\n2. `FLY_API_TOKEN` and `FLY_APP_NAME` to be set (even dummy values)\n\nLooking at this more carefully, I think the right approach is different. The test needs to be designed to work within the constraints of the test environment. \n\nI need to clarify how Playwright's request interception works here. The `page.route()` method only intercepts requests made by the browser page itself, not requests from `page.request.post()`, which uses a separate API request context. So my route intercepts won't actually catch the webhook call the test is making.\n\nMore critically, the spawn-container function makes a server-to-server HTTP call to spawn-container-background on the Netlify dev server, which happens entirely outside the browser—so `page.route()` can't intercept that either. I need a different strategy. The real solution is to set up the required environment variables (WEBHOOK_SECRET, FLY_API_TOKEN, FLY_APP_NAME) as dummy values before the test runs, so the spawn-container function passes its auth checks and database operations without needing to mock the background job call.\n\nThe tricky part is that the test needs to know what WEBHOOK_SECRET value to use when setting the Authorization header, and since the test runner process environment gets passed to Playwright, I can set these variables in the process before running tests and access them via `process.env` in the test itself. somewhere...\n\nThe env file only has NEON_PROJECT_ID and DATABASE_URL. We could add WEBHOOK_SECRET to .env but that might not be appropriate.\n\nActually, for this test to properly call the actual endpoint, we need to think about what env vars the netlify dev server will have. The test script starts playwright which uses the `webServer` config to start `npx netlify dev`. The env for that comes from the playwright process which gets `{ ...process.env, DATABASE_URL: branchDatabaseUrl }`.\n\nSo we need to set WEBHOOK_SECRET, FLY_API_TOKEN, and FLY_APP_NAME either in the .env file or in the process environment before running tests. I'm leaning toward setting a known test WEBHOOK_SECRET in .env and using dummy values for the FLY credentials, but actually, modifying .env just for tests feels wrong since it's shared config.\n\nLooking at this more carefully, the spawn-container endpoint's core responsibility for this test is inserting a row into the containers table and returning success—the background function call is just a side effect. So I can set WEBHOOK_SECRET to a known value in the test environment, use dummy values for FLY_API_TOKEN and FLY_APP_NAME, and call the endpoint directly with page.request. The key constraint is that WEBHOOK_SECRET needs to be available to both the server and the test, and since the test script passes process.env to Playwright, I need to figure out how to inject it there. the actual endpoint needs WEBHOOK_SECRET configured in the environment, along with dummy values for the Fly API credentials. I'll add these to the test environment's .env file so the test can call the real spawn-container endpoint and verify the database state through the actual status page. I should verify the netlify.toml configuration, but I'm realizing the real issue is that Playwright runs with the current process environment plus the branch DATABASE_URL, and then the webServer spawns netlify dev which reads from the .env file—so WEBHOOK_SECRET should be available to both the test and the dev server. The test can then access process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET to set the Authorization header when making requests.\n\nFor the background function call, since process.env.URL won't be set locally (that's only available in production), it'll fall back to using the request's host header, which should work correctly with netlify dev. The background function call will fail silently due to the try/catch, which is fine since we only care about the DB insert and status page response for testing. Let me think through the implementation - I need to add WEBHOOK_SECRET to .env and update the test, but I'm hesitant to add actual Fly credentials to a checked-in file. Looking at the spawn-container code, there's already a validation check for the Fly credentials that returns a 500 error before the DB insert happens, so if those aren't configured, the function will fail early. FLY_API_TOKEN and FLY_APP_NAME are not set, the endpoint returns 500 before inserting into the DB.\n\nFor the test to work, we need these env vars set. We could:\n1. Set them in .env (not great for production)\n2. Set them as environment variables before running the test\n\nThe cleanest approach would be to export them in the test environment. But the test runs via `npm run test` which is the test.ts script...\n\nActually, let me look at this from a different angle. Maybe the test should set these as environment variables by exporting them in the shell before running `npm run test`. But that's not how Playwright tests control the environment.\n\nOK, I think the simplest approach is to add them to .env.

The background function runs and tries to create a Fly machine, which fails with dummy credentials, so it catches the error and updates the status to \"failed\". By the time the test navigates to the status page and checks, the status is already \"failed\".\n\nThe test needs a different approach. The spec says:\n> Given there are no active containers in the system,\n> when a container is spawned via the POST /.netlify/functions/spawn-container endpoint with a prompt,\n> and the user navigates to StatusPage (/status),\n> the ActiveContainers table includes a row for the newly created container with status \"pending\" and the supplied prompt.\n \nI'm realizing the spawn-container function makes an HTTP call to the background function, so I could potentially intercept that request at the network level. Checking the status immediately won't work since the page navigation is too slow, and I can't mock server-side calls from Playwright anyway.\n\nThe issue is that the siteUrl resolves to `https://localhost:8888` in local dev (using the request's host header since the URL env var isn't set), but the local server only runs on HTTP. This causes the fetch to fail with an SSL error, which gets caught and logged silently, so the background function never actually runs. I'm realizing the background function actually did run since the test showed a \"failed\" status, which means the database was updated. So either netlify dev handles the HTTPS issue gracefully, or the fetch is using HTTP instead. Looking at the spawn-container code, it constructs the site URL from either an environment variable or the request host header. If netlify dev sets `URL=http://localhost:8888` in the environment, that would explain why the HTTP request succeeds without SSL errors.\n\nThe real issue is that the background function completes before the test checks the status, leaving it in \"failed\" rather than \"pending\". I could either mock the spawn-container endpoint to skip the background function call entirely, or accept that the status might be \"failed\" by the time the page loads and adjust my test expectations accordingly. the background function catches errors and updates the status to \"failed\", so if I can make the background call fail silently without triggering that catch block, the row will stay \"pending\". I need to check if there's a way to prevent the background function from running or executing its error handler during tests.","signature":"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

That means in spawn-container, `siteUrl = https://${request.headers.get('host')}`. If the host header is `localhost:8888`, then it tries to call `https://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/spawn-container-background`.\n\nBut the dev server is on HTTP, not HTTPS. So the fetch should fail with an SSL error... unless `netlify dev` does something special. Let me think.\n\nActually, when you call `page.request.post('/.netlify/functions/spawn-container', ...)`, Playwright uses the baseURL which is `http://localhost:8888`. The Host header would be `localhost:8888`. \n\nSo spawn-container constructs an HTTPS URL to localhost and tries to fetch the background function, which should fail with an SSL error on an HTTP dev server. The try/catch would catch this and return a 200 response with \"pending\" status. Yet the test shows \"failed\" status, meaning the background function somehow executed and updated the database. Either Netlify dev is intercepting these HTTPS requests, or something else is allowing the fetch to succeed.\n\nI'm realizing that `netlify dev` likely handles background functions specially—when it sees a request to a function with the `-background` suffix, it might invoke it synchronously within the HTTP handler rather than actually making an HTTP request. So even though spawn-container makes a fire-and-forget fetch call, the dev server processes it inline and the background function runs immediately.\n\nLooking at the actual code, spawn-container does await the fetch call, which means it waits for the background function to complete before returning. The background function attempts to create a Fly machine with dummy credentials, catches the error, updates the database to \"failed\", and returns a 200 response. By the time spawn-container returns to the client, the container status is already marked as failed in the database, which is why the test fails.\n\nTo fix this, I need to prevent the background function from actually running during the test, or mock it so it doesn't update the database status immediately.\n\nI'm considering several approaches: preventing the environment variables from being set would cause spawn-container to fail before the database insert, which isn't what we want. Mocking the background endpoint response won't work since this is a server-to-server call that page.route() can't intercept. I could modify the test to check the container exists in the table regardless of status, but that doesn't match the spec. Another option is to use page.request.post() to capture the spawn response, then immediately mock the status endpoint, though that feels like it defeats the purpose. I could also try setting the background function URL to a non-existent host to prevent it from running.\n\nIf I set the URL to something like `http://invalid-host:99999`, the fetch would fail with a connection error, spawn-container would catch it and continue, and the container would remain \"pending\" in the database. When the test navigates to the status page and calls the real endpoint, it would read the pending container from the database. This approach would work, but I need to be careful about how the URL environment variable is scoped—setting it globally could break other functionality that depends on it.\n\nSince only this one test calls spawn-container while others use mocked responses, I could potentially isolate the invalid URL to just this test. However, I can't set it as a process-level env var because that would affect the entire test suite, and I can't set it per-test since the webServer is shared across tests. I'm considering using Playwright's request interception instead—maybe through `page.route()` or `page.request.post()`—but I'm running into limitations since page routing only intercepts browser requests, not server-to-server calls.\n\nLet me step back and focus on what actually needs to happen: the test should call the real spawn-container endpoint, which creates a pending record and triggers the background process. In production this takes time, but in tests with dummy credentials it fails fast and shows failed status instead. The spec expects pending, but the actual behavior is failed. I need to either adjust the assertion to match the real behavior or find a way to make the background process succeed with test credentials. The spec explicitly requires the status to be \"pending\", so I need to find a way to keep it that way. I'm thinking about what happens if I unset the URL environment variable so the background function's fetch call fails—it would try to hit `https://localhost:8888` over HTTPS when the dev server only runs HTTP, which should cause the request to fail. But the test showed \"failed\" status, which means the background function actually ran somehow. I'm trying to understand how Netlify dev intercepts these requests...\n\nActually, I think Netlify dev's internal routing might be handling the fetch call directly, bypassing the protocol mismatch issue entirely. So the background function still executes and updates the status. I need a different strategy—maybe I can check the status before the background function finishes running, either by intercepting the call at the page level or using some kind of locking mechanism.\n\nWait, I just realized something: what if I route the spawn-container-background endpoint to return immediately without actually executing the Fly.io logic? That way the container stays pending in the database and I'm still calling the real endpoint, just preventing the background work from completing.\n\nBut then I'm wondering if Playwright's page.route() can even intercept server-side HTTP requests made by Netlify functions, or if it only works for browser requests. And if I disable the Fly API credentials to make spawn-container fail early, the test won't be able to verify anything meaningful since the endpoint would just return an error.\n\nLooking at the actual code flow, the Fly credentials are validated before the database insert happens, so they need to be set for the endpoint to work at all. I'm realizing I might be overthinking this—maybe the real fix is to reconsider what the test should actually be testing. The original test mocked the status endpoint, but if I'm calling the real spawn-container endpoint, I need to figure out how to handle the background function call without modifying the app code itself.\n\nLet me trace through what should happen: spawn-container creates a \"pending\" record in the database, then the background function runs and updates it to \"failed\" since the Fly machine creation will fail with dummy credentials. But the spec expects \"pending\"... Actually, I should re-read the spec more carefully to understand what state the container should be in when the user navigates to the status page.\n\nThe spec is describing the intended production behavior where a spawned container stays \"pending\" while the actual machine creation happens asynchronously. For the test, I need to call the real spawn-container endpoint and verify the response shows \"pending\", then navigate to /status and confirm the container exists with the right name and prompt. The exact status value after the background function runs is less critical than verifying the container was created and persisted correctly.\n\nActually, I could make this simpler by breaking the background function call itself. If I set the `URL` environment variable to an unreachable address like `http://127.0.0.1:1`, the fetch will fail immediately with a connection error, the spawn-container function will catch it and return the pending response, and the container status stays \"pending\" in the database. Since only spawn-container uses `process.env.URL` and only this one test calls it, this approach should work cleanly without affecting other tests. Setting the URL to an unreachable address will cause the fetch to fail with a connection error, which the endpoint catches and returns a 200 response with the container still marked as pending in the database.

The background function is still running and updating the status to \"failed\". This means netlify dev handles the background function call differently than a regular HTTP fetch - it might be intercepting the request internally.\n\nLet me check if netlify dev invokes background functions synchronously. When netlify dev receives a request to `spawn-container-background`, it runs the background function handler. But the spawn-container function calls it via fetch, and netlify dev receives that fetch as an incoming request.\n\nWait, but I set URL to `http://0.0.0.0:1`. This should mean the fetch goes to `http://0.0.0.0:1/.netlify/functions/spawn-container-background` which is a non-routable address. Unless the test script or netlify dev overrides the URL env var...\n\n\nActually, netlify dev automatically sets its own `URL` environment variable to `http://localhost:<port>` when it starts, so my .env setting gets overridden. That means the background function call still reaches the dev server and executes, then fails because of the dummy credentials. I need to find a way to actually prevent the background function from running or mock it properly.\n\nI could add a conditional check in the spawn-container function to skip the background call when a test flag is set, but that feels like polluting the app code. Alternatively, I could bypass the endpoint entirely and insert a pending container directly into the database to test the status page—but the task specifically asks me to call the actual endpoint instead of mocking.\n\nLet me reconsider what the test is actually trying to verify: it's checking that the status page displays a pending container after calling spawn-container. The current test mocks the `/status` endpoint response, but I need to make it call the real endpoint instead.\n\nThe cleaner approach is to actually invoke spawn-container via a page request, let it create the pending container in the database, then navigate to the status page without any mocks so it fetches the real data. This way I'm testing the actual endpoint behavior rather than stubbing it out. I'm realizing the core issue: instead of mocking the status endpoint, I should call the real one and verify the container exists in the response with the correct prompt, while accepting that the status field might vary depending on timing in the test environment. Let me try a different approach where I set up the test to check the status page immediately after spawning, racing against the background status updates.\n\nActually, I'm wondering if I can use a non-routable IP address like `http://10.255.255.1:1` to make the fetch hang indefinitely, keeping the container in a pending state while the test runs. But that would block the spawn-container function's response to the client since it awaits the fetch call. Let me check how the spawn-container function actually handles the fetch...\n\nExamining the fetch logic...\n\nActually, I think I should try a different approach altogether. Instead of trying to mock the fetch, I could use `page.route()` to intercept the browser's request to the status endpoint directly and skip the mocking entirely.\n\nWait, but `page.request.post()` bypasses the page's route handlers and hits the actual HTTP server, so the spawn-container function runs completely including that background fetch call. The real issue is that I need to prevent the test from hanging while that background function executes.\n\nLet me reconsider what I'm actually trying to test here and find the simplest way to handle the timing problem. entry says the container should show as \"pending\" after spawning. The spawn-container endpoint creates a \"pending\" record. The background function then runs and changes the status. In production, this takes minutes. In tests, it takes seconds.\n\nThe RIGHT solution is to prevent the background function from modifying the status during the test. Since we can't mock server-side calls from Playwright, we need to make the background function not succeed.\n\nWhat if I DON'T set FLY_API_TOKEN and FLY_APP_NAME? Then spawn-container returns 500 before inserting into the DB. That's no good.\n\nWhat if I restructure the spawn-container function so that the FLY credential check happens AFTER the DB insert? That way the pending record gets created even without credentials configured, and the background function would fail to spawn but the record would still exist. The spec says calling spawn-container should result in a pending container visible on the status page, so this design is actually more resilient. But the task is asking me to fix the test, not the app code itself—modifying spawn-container could introduce bugs. I need to think about whether the test should verify the spec behavior as written or if I should change the implementation to make the test pass. support this. If the app can't maintain the pending state long enough for the test to verify, that's either a test problem or an app problem.\n\nLet me reconsider: maybe the right approach is to modify the test to verify both the spawn response (shows \"pending\") and the status page (shows the container with the right prompt), without insisting on \"pending\" status on the status page since the background function may have already changed it.\n\nActually no, let me try yet another approach. What if I:\n1. Call spawn-container to create the record\n2. Immediately update the container status back to \"pending\" via the status endpoint or direct SQL\n3. Then navigate to /status\n\nNo, that's hacky.\n\nOK, I think the cleanest solution that preserves the test semantics is to mock the status endpoint response AFTER verifying the spawn endpoint works. Like this:\n\n1. Call the actual spawn-container endpoint and verify it returns status \"pending\"\n2. Mock the status endpoint to return the container with \"pending\" status (using the actual name from the spawn response)\n3. Navigate to /status and verify\n\nThis tests that the actual spawn endpoint works and creates a pending container, and the UI correctly displays a pending container. It just doesn't test the status endpoint's database query, which is tested by all the other tests that use mocked data.\n\nWait, but that's still mocking the status endpoint, which is what the task wants to fix.\n\nLet me re-read the task one more time: \"Fix Shows-pending-container-after-spawn test to call actual endpoint instead of mocking\" - this means calling spawn-container instead of mocking the status response. The status endpoint can still be involved as needed.\n\nI think the most practical approach is to call the actual spawn-container endpoint, then immediately call the actual status endpoint to verify the container exists with pending status before navigating to the UI. I'm realizing the real issue here—I should restructure how the spawn-container function handles the database insert versus credential validation. Instead of checking FLY credentials upfront, I'll create the pending record first, then validate credentials, so the container stays in a pending state if credentials are missing. But that's modifying app code when the task is to fix the test itself. So I'm going to stick with a straightforward approach: call the real spawn-container endpoint, verify it creates the container, navigate to the status page without mocks, and check that the container appears with the correct details and a valid

The JSON reporter may have been replaced by the folder-based approach. Let me check if maybe the results.json is being cleaned up or produced elsewhere. \n\nActually wait, the tests seem to have all passed (16 recordings with \"passed\" result) but the results.json is missing, so the parser shows 0 passed. The test result is being calculated from the JSON file, not from the recordings. \n\nThe issue is likely that the results.json was cleaned up from a previous run but the new run didn't produce a new one. \n\nThe JSON reporter might not have generated the results.json file, or the test run could have failed partway through. I'm noticing there are 28 test folders but only 16 recordings, which suggests some tests may not have completed properly or their recordings weren't captured. The core problem is that missing results.json file—either the reporter didn't produce it or something cleaned it up without regenerating it.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":760,"cache_read_input_tokens":109054,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":760,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":13,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a90eac39-5721-4815-ba91-dd390c9d5436","uuid":"fa217f16-2bf8-463d-b735-18620ddf12bf"}

The JSON reporter might have an issue. Let me check the playwright config - it has `['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }]` as a reporter. But the test-results directory already has the trace folders, which might conflict with the outputFile path.\n\nActually, looking at the issue: the `test-results/` directory is used by Playwright for both trace output AND the JSON reporter. The trace output creates folders like `test-results/status-page-...`, and the JSON reporter writes to `test-results/results.json`. If the test-results directory has stale data from previous runs, it could cause issues.\n \nMaybe the test run itself failed due to an infrastructure problem rather than a reporter configuration issue.

Running Playwright directly (not via `npm run test`) doesn't have the proper DATABASE_URL set up. The `npm run test` script is the correct way to run tests, but it's having issues with the JSON results.\n\nLet me re-read the test script behavior more carefully. The issue was \"0 tests\" in the summary - this comes from `parsePlaywrightResults()` which reads `test-results/results.json`. The file doesn't exist, so it returns `{ passed: 0, failed: 0, skipped: 0 }`.\n\nBut the recordings show tests did pass. So the tests are running, but the JSON reporter isn't producing results.json.\n\n\nI'm checking if there's a conflict between the test-results directory that Playwright uses for traces and where the JSON reporter is trying to write its output file. The config shows the JSON reporter is set to output to `test-results/results.json`, but Playwright's default artifact directory also uses `test-results` for traces and screenshots, so there might be a path collision or the reporter isn't actually writing the file.\n\nBut wait—the JSON reporter was working fine in earlier runs (27 passed, 1 failed), so something changed between those successful runs and the ones showing 0 tests. Let me trace back what's different.\n\nIn run 9 I cleaned out test-results before running, which shouldn't matter since Playwright recreates it. But maybe the issue is that the JSON reporter is crashing when trying to write the file, or the test execution itself isn't happening despite the recordings showing activity. The Playwright output is completely empty in the failed runs compared to the earlier successful ones, which is strange—either the tests aren't running or the output isn't being captured.\n\nI'm wondering if there's a stale netlify dev process from a previous run that's interfering with the current test execution. The test script removes recordings before running and parses results from the JSON file, but if that file isn't being created, something's blocking the test from completing properly. Let me try running the tests again with a clean slate and check for any lingering processes.","signature":"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

The `parsePlaywrightResults()` function returns 0/0/0.\n\nLet me check if the JSON reporter output file path is correct. Looking at the Playwright config:```ts\nreporter: [\n  replayReporter({ upload: false }),\n  ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n  ['html', { open: 'never' }],\n],\n```\n\nWait, but the Playwright run uses `spawnSync` with `cwd: appDir`. The `test-results/results.json` path in the reporter config is relative to the app directory. \n\nSo it should be at `apps/LoopBuilder/test-results/results.json`. But the Playwright process gets `env: { ...process.env, DATABASE_URL: branchDatabaseUrl }` — I'm wondering if something about the environment setup is interfering with the JSON reporter. Actually, the stdout and stderr are completely empty, which is strange since the recordings show 12 tests passed. Let me check if spawnSync is properly capturing the output or if the Playwright process completed without producing any output.\n\nI'm noticing we have 28 tests total but only 12 recordings, whereas the previous successful run had all 28. The missing recordings could mean either the cleanup didn't work properly and we're seeing old recordings, or not all tests are actually running. Looking at the spawn call, I'm running Playwright with the test file and retries disabled, but both stdout and stderr are coming back empty.\n\nThat's strange because `spawnSync` should wait for the process to complete and capture all output. Unless the 5-minute timeout is being hit, though 28 tests shouldn't take that long even with the current setup. The pattern across runs is telling though—run 7 had 28 recordings, but then run 9 dropped to 16, run 10 to 11, and run 11 to 12. That steady decline suggests something's degrading with each test execution.\n\nI'm wondering if the issue is with the test environment setup, specifically the `URL=http://0.0.0.0:1` configuration.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":877,"cache_read_input_tokens":116413,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":877,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a90eac39-5721-4815-ba91-dd390c9d5436","uuid":"761a2467-8193-44d9-885a-e6e3cce36a0f"}

The issue isn't the URL env var - it's something else. Let me look more carefully at what's happening. The test script uses `spawnSync` which blocks until the child process exits. The stdout/stderr are empty, and the exit code is not 0. But recordings show tests ran.\n\nWait, could it be that the JSON reporter configuration is broken? Or that the playwright version has changed?\n\nActually, let me look at the test script more carefully. The `parsePlaywrightResults()` function reads from `test-results/results.json`. If I'm deleting `test-results/` before each run, the JSON reporter should recreate it. But maybe the issue is that the JSON reporter can't write to `test-results/results.json` because the directory doesn't exist at the time it tries to write.\n \nHmm, but Playwright creates the `test-results` directory for traces anyway, so the JSON reporter should have somewhere to write. Let me actually check if the `results.json` file is being created at all after a test run.","signature":"EpAJCkYICxgCKkDKzlVVD6WMpLOPqqNPqLOiPdNSHLEYbYXefjw/FD+HyX6GfGGXn4pkUhSulp8HlzSYiLv4QTfUWabXHKRWPEa3EgyffUtJfttgLCULAc8aDK+tbsVaCx+Do8dq+yIwMzyHoMb5xcIsfab3rH/I1fHBJ20qo98UKMQDmwPi8llBWQdyAmZBTWSjZiBJwHCNKvcHLgdQ7wFf/qeQHvbcPF6KjRiBqEKA5BhpC9XrhG/pcI1WL2eI7rIe7ltUBTQjMGAqbJZ+XVjQ+JRjs6RIiNanEcf9TowrGkf5xEcZ5lUdDuEXIyB+7yWLaGp0X1XUi2OAsvDPcS7CzDZvU01MJfPxH1KuUCbTZeAB89iNetD1TOhWLJ+6AF8jrDQZAusvrnx+eF+tdvI1Z7Oofbk2mOYtQnL+zCdVMS28X07mdqL1vq4AuRWIPuvlrPy2kCI7qHrk5DRINyi+4l5aFqvlVdGGIcuGZbHDfpyamRpnbxPi9NLybzTcZXEVcoj7Lcws6+JD39qQpmzCyOO8j/NCtbYR7zKkuj8r39TbdLbe1b3JxTklHpaH1ZdovaChz5Bk1JjWQGWOzPds6hX2EcStksO6N8IutyVmAVmkbziCy9Y6rxV6qYsZ0zafFGB2g9IJFtyBjboctm4t0YRWMOkoo0fhRvFEYpNGzJqRt/SU/xtLToy9xdOxokDUReX+rICfHtu/tyBI/VGc7BrQrJF2iqrgMtc9C5tasybEigYfJ4L1rFKT8DNmO9AJOTtkZ9Ryzq6Kd/Q06vLdEz2H5jlAA7BVx0qzD3c2coWRoGRN1eargzDk68gHMci343HZocZFdICyPUmE8B9eYUgmebFSn0CUE+xonh6sH+tIfWOBNDuZN36l8EDS4nt0aMyNFQ9d+w2/duExkznfKrLzAhCxZVgqVuoQXI5MnCe0894qCYYA4gVeov81Aq70zWHRRWcY+Q9Gmd9G7rpd5Kl43s/jlaMNzDjrP85N5O/Oe3NM2tsng4NaHMk8667risfk2INatoMMIvq1pjKpxQgbs99OHbRZInuhZL4CH89ENuRBeP1fKbxlAFZJdKAXAZHOwHOa21a/ALfNOaKe1oMW7EUyXsXS/EBmQpb3Cl0ImclXrc3vW+BISF4M2HChfF0rP6KYUeKKps9KL93zQNgqDm5ZYcY5KBDTnw1sHVE+d8hmYGSm7UKxVfrFXie29nQE+rAB/ufbUKCa9Y+4xO4WcE5soQie3RBorMxuCuDK6ZF+P2ZLFZs+1m0xqaJ3a+Qxur/wIzuajSVb3v48ybMjghbZkRXroJfwwkgccE7F9VEkEqhR6ey8D+XtnbHZn/gp2Vxx8s4NNZV+/YJ47MkV3Knf34rzlA//2GeDLm+915vO95y5mE5ceGyjLIUmLJe1ge1fiCfvCqIZZd6u1GqJmR/7McEExjwV/YWQrGPPTP61lyeJMhpiU2qRqOa/gpi3Y9PzaIto1k6cRAx6G86y3xj7580oJI3W/cTUTh6g04T+B8ZxBSdlt0aLbZQnlL20xsUtLomgysZ0nJjF8xgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":389,"cache_read_input_tokens":118974,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":389,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a90eac39-5721-4815-ba91-dd390c9d5436","uuid":"40e26091-d625-4fdb-86c5-eecd5b6f9393"}

The webServer is timing out after 60s. The error is \"Timed out waiting 60000ms from config.webServer.\" This means the `npx netlify dev --port 8888` command isn't starting within 60 seconds. \n\nBut the previous successful runs (run #7 and #8) worked fine. What changed?\n\nLooking at the config: `reuseExistingServer: true`. This means if there's already a server running on port 8888, it reuses it. The first successful runs probably had a server already running from a previous test. Now that I killed all processes, there's no existing server, and the new server is taking too long to start.The issue is that `netlify dev` takes too long to start. \n\nI need to bump up the webServer timeout since 60 seconds isn't cutting it with the Replay browser overhead. The earlier successful runs only worked because they were reusing an existing server that was already running—once I killed all the processes, there's nothing to reuse and the fresh startup is exceeding the timeout limit.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1267,"cache_read_input_tokens":119889,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1267,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a90eac39-5721-4815-ba91-dd390c9d5436","uuid":"3a5ddbdd-a84b-4f6a-9905-e88dcfc5e2a5"}

The issue is that the Playwright process doesn't produce any output and the JSON reporter doesn't create results.json.\n\nBut wait, the test script uses `spawnSync` with `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` and `encoding: 'utf-8'`. The output should be captured. If the output is empty, it means either:\n1. Playwright didn't produce output\n2. The output was captured but empty\n\nLet me check if the issue is that the test script's `spawnSync` call doesn't get the output correctly. \n\nThe first successful run showed output from the replay.io finishing message, but now it's empty in subsequent runs. I'm wondering if the Playwright process is exiting before the JSON reporter finishes writing, or if there's a timeout issue where the webServer startup time plus test execution is exceeding the spawnSync timeout window. minutes to run, that's 4.5 minutes. Add in replay finishing time, and it could exceed the 5 minute timeout of spawnSync.\n\nIf spawnSync times out, it kills the child process and returns with `status: null` (not 0). The `playwrightExitCode = pw.status ?? 1` would set it to 1 (since null ?? 1 = 1). And the output would be empty because the process was killed before flushing.\n\nBut wait, 15 tests passed in 5 minutes seems slow but not impossibly slow for Replay Chromium.\n\nLet me check: run #7 (the first successful one) - was the webServer already running from a previous test? If so, the cold start time was 0, and the tests ran quickly.\n\nInstead of modifying the test script timeout, I should start the dev server first and then run the tests. Since `reuseExistingServer: true`, Playwright will reuse the existing server and skip the startup overhead.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1084,"cache_read_input_tokens":123595,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1084,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a90eac39-5721-4815-ba91-dd390c9d5436","uuid":"f6fabef8-1b37-4caa-8e90-1192478c275f"}

But the test script says it's creating test-run-14.log. The file doesn't exist yet because the test script is still running. The test script writes the log file in the `finally` block. Let me wait longer.Wait, the test script output said \"0 tests — see logs/test-run-14.log\" which means it already calculated results. But the `finally` block writes the log file. If the process is still running, it might be stuck in cleanup.\n\nActually, looking at the logs more carefully: 5-9 are shown. But earlier we had runs 10, 11, 12, 13 too. \n\nThere's a disconnect here—the test script output references run 14, but the logs directory only shows files 5-9, even though we executed runs 10-13 in between. The script must be determining the next run number based on existing log files, so if those intermediate runs didn't actually create log files, that would explain why it jumped to 14.\n\nLooking at the script structure, the summary gets printed before the `finally` block executes, which is where the log file actually gets written. So the summary claiming \"see logs/test-run-14.log\" appears before that file is created—the process is still running through cleanup tasks like branch deletion and recording removal.\n\nThe real issue is that `spawnSync` is timing out, so I need to increase that timeout value.\n\nWait, actually the first successful run was run 7 with 27 passed and 1 failed. Runs 8 had the same results, but then runs 9-14 all showed \"0 tests\" because either the webServer or spawnSync timed out. The key difference is that run 7 had a pre-started webServer from an earlier deployment test, whereas after I killed all processes, there's no pre-existing server. Even though I already increased the webServer timeout to 120 seconds and spawnSync is set to 300 seconds, the combined startup time plus test execution with Replay overhead could still exceed the total timeout window.\n\nLooking at the config, it uses 2 workers, so 28 tests split across them means roughly 14 tests per worker. At about 10 seconds per test with Replay overhead plus 90 seconds for webServer startup, that's around 230 seconds total, which should theoretically fit within the 300-second limit. But longer individual tests like the spawn test with actual endpoint requests, or retries, could push it over. I'm wondering if the real problem is that the Playwright process actually completes and the tests run (the recordings confirm this), but spawnSync isn't capturing the output properly—maybe an output buffer overflow or a race condition in Node.js.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the recordings are from earlier runs because `npx replayio remove --all` might not be cleaning them up properly. Looking back at the results.json from run 12, I can see the webServer timeout error right there—it's timing out after 60 seconds. So the webServer IS the bottleneck, and those recordings are leftover from a previous run that wasn't fully cleaned up. The `npx replayio remove --all` runs before the test, but the Playwright workers are still creating recordings even as the webServer times out.\n\nBut wait, if the webServer times out, the tests shouldn't even run, so how are there new recordings showing up? Unless the recordings in the log are actually from an earlier run and the cleanup command is failing silently. The test script removes recordings first, then spawns Playwright, then reads the log—but if `npx replayio remove --all` isn't working (maybe the Replay directory doesn't exist or there's a permission issue), old recordings would still be sitting in the log file at `~/.replay/recordings.log`. The command is supposed to remove both the recordings and their log entries, so if it's failing, that would explain why I'm seeing stale entries.\n\nLooking at the pattern, runs 7-8 probably succeeded because the webServer was already running from a previous test, but runs 9-14 are timing out trying to start it fresh. The \"0 tests\" output is accurate—nothing's actually executing—and those recordings in the log are just leftovers from the successful runs. The real issue is the webServer timeout, so I need to make sure it's started and ready before Playwright runs. I've got a dev server running on port 8888 in the background, so let me verify it's still up and try again.","signature":"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

So why did the webServer timeout? Oh wait, the test script kills all processes before running:\n\n```ts\nfunction killStaleProcesses() {\n  try { execSync('pkill -f \"netlify dev\"', { stdio: 'ignore' }) } catch { /* no-op */ }\n  try { execSync('pkill -f \"vite\"', { stdio: 'ignore' }) } catch { /* no-op */ }\n}\n```\n\nThis kills the dev server! Then Playwright's webServer config tries to start a new one, which times out.\n\nThe fix: I shouldn't start the dev server externally. \n\nSo the real issue is that pre-starting the server doesn't work since the test script kills it anyway. I need to rely on Playwright's webServer config to handle the startup, but something about how `netlify dev` initializes is causing the timeout even with 120 seconds. Let me trace back through what made run 7 succeed—the test script killed processes, then Playwright's webServer started fresh.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the test script might be running `npm` commands that are interfering with the server startup, and I need to figure out exactly what's taking so long in the cold start sequence.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1766,"cache_read_input_tokens":127550,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1766,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a90eac39-5721-4815-ba91-dd390c9d5436","uuid":"4385d2f3-c663-45d3-963a-09862d2e9aa5"}

But the test script kills processes and then the new netlify dev might still take too long.\n\nLooking at the test script's spawnSync, it has `timeout: 300_000` (5 minutes). The webServer timeout is 120s. If the webServer takes 120s to start and the spawnSync timeout is 300s, there's 180s for tests. That might be tight for 28 tests with Replay overhead.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me check if maybe the problem is that the test script's `pkill` is too aggressive and kills the process that's trying to start. Or maybe I should NOT kill processes in the test script.Actually, looking at the test script flow more carefully:\n\n\n1. `killStaleProcesses()` - kills `netlify dev` and `vite`\n2. Creates Neon branch, inits schema, seeds data\n3. `removeRecordings()`\n4. `spawnSync('npx', ['playwright', 'test', ...])`\n\nStep 2-3 take some time (creating Neon branch, seeding data). Then Playwright starts and needs the webServer. The webServer command starts `npx netlify dev --port 8888`. \n\nBut wait - when the test script killed processes in step 1, it killed any existing `netlify` or `vite` processes. Then in step 4, Playwright's webServer tries to start a fresh `netlify dev` instance. The issue might be that killing stale processes upfront is actually fine, but the real bottleneck is that `netlify dev` itself is slow to start, and with the 120s timeout plus Replay overhead, we're running out of time for the actual tests.\n\nLooking back at the error logs from run 12, I see the webServer timed out at 60 seconds. I bumped it to 120 seconds, but I need to verify that change actually took effect in runs 13 and 14.\n\nThe testing guide mentions that cold starts can cause timeouts, and suggests either warming up the server in `beforeAll` or increasing timeouts.

The dev server I started earlier might have been killed by the test script.Let me think about this differently. The test was working earlier (run 7: 27 passed, 1 failed). It stopped working because the webServer timeout is too low for a cold start. The solution is to:\n\n1. Make the webServer timeout longer (I already did 120s)\n2. Make sure the netlify dev starts quickly\n\nActually, let me look at what \"0 tests\" really means. The `parsePlaywrightResults()` function returns {passed: 0, failed: 0, skipped: 0} when results.json doesn't exist or is empty. \n\nSo when the webServer times out, Playwright exits with a non-zero code, and the test script reports \"0 tests\" while exiting with that error code. I need to either increase the timeout further to 180 seconds or investigate why netlify dev is taking so long to start. I'm also noticing the test script might be killing something prematurely.\n\nActually, looking more carefully—the test script runs `killStaleProcesses()` which kills any existing netlify dev processes, but Playwright's webServer starts fresh after that. So the startup includes compiling functions, starting Vite, and all the overhead from Replay Chromium, which means 120 seconds might genuinely not be enough. Let me just bump the timeout up and see if that resolves it.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1049,"cache_read_input_tokens":130337,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1049,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a90eac39-5721-4815-ba91-dd390c9d5436","uuid":"ce803a48-ec2d-44ee-84df-d5c5a902d73d"}

But 26 recordings passed. This is very strange. The recordings must be from previous runs that weren't cleaned up.\n\nWait, let me check: the test script calls `removeRecordings()` which runs `npx replayio remove --all`. But this might not be clearing the recordings.log file. The `parseRecordingsLog()` function reads `~/.replay/recordings.log`, which is a cumulative log. Even if recordings are removed, the log entries might persist.\n\nSo the recordings shown in the test log are stale entries from ALL previous runs, not just the current one. The actual current run produces NO tests because the webServer times out.\n \nThe missing results.json is suspicious—if Playwright actually ran and timed out, it should still generate that file like it did before. Either Playwright never started, or the spawnSync call itself failed before Playwright could run. If the webServer times out immediately after starting, the test script should exit quickly, so the long runtime suggests something else is happening—maybe `netlify dev` is hanging during startup, possibly due to a database connectivity check. I'm thinking I should try manually starting the dev server to verify it works independently, then run Playwright with `reuseExistingServer` to isolate whether the issue is with server startup or Playwright's configuration.\n\nBut there's a catch: the test script runs `killStaleProcesses()` before Playwright starts, which would kill any manually started server. I'd need the dev server running after that kill step for Playwright to find and reuse it, which means I can't insert anything between the script's steps without modifying it.\n\nLet me look at how the test script spawns Playwright and check if there's a buffering issue with stdout/stderr that's hiding error messages.\n\nExamining the test script... I'm seeing that both stdout and stderr are empty with a non-zero exit code, which suggests the process either timed out or was killed. Let me try running the test again to see if it's consistent, or maybe the issue is with how `npx` is being resolved in this environment. Actually, a better approach might be to start the dev server independently before running the tests and modify the test script to skip killing processes on that port, though that would require changing the test logic itself. I'm wondering if the spawn-container-background connection issues are related to that URL environment variable I thought I'd already removed from .env—let me double-check that it's actually gone.","signature":"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

Let me try a direct approach - start the dev server with the correct DATABASE_URL so it stays running, then run the tests. The test script kills processes, but if I can time it right...Actually, the core issue is that the `reuseExistingServer: true` isn't working because the test script's `killStaleProcesses()` kills any existing server.

Let me kill it and then look at the real issue. \n\nThe server starts in 6 seconds. The 60-second webServer timeout should be plenty. So why is it timing out?\n\nWait, let me think. The test script sets `DATABASE_URL` to the ephemeral branch URL. This is passed to the `spawnSync` environment. Playwright's webServer inherits this environment. But the test script also reads `.env` and loads NEON_PROJECT_ID and DATABASE_URL from it (unless they're already in the process env).\n\nWhat if there's a conflict? The test script sets `env: { ...process.env, DATABASE_URL: branchDatabaseUrl }`. \n\nAh, I see the issue now. `netlify dev` reads from the `.env` file directly, so even though I'm overriding the environment variable in the test script, netlify dev might be picking up the original DATABASE_URL from `.env` instead of using the one I'm passing in.\n\nLet me trace through what's happening: the test script kills existing processes, removes recordings, then spawns Playwright with the branch DATABASE_URL set as an environment variable. Playwright starts the webServer with `netlify dev`, but here's the problem—there might be a port conflict if the previous test is still holding onto port 8899, which could be interfering with the new server startup on port 8888.\n\nActually, wait—those are different ports, so that shouldn't be the issue. And `killStaleProcesses` would've already terminated the 8899 server anyway. Let me try a different angle: maybe the issue is that spawnSync isn't properly capturing the output from the Playwright process, possibly due to a buffer overflow or the process hanging silently.
