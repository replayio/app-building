Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4783eb68-04ed-4dbc-b5a6-99a5bde1b6b3","uuid":"5b66101d-188e-4d3e-abd8-ab2be7e24ae7","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4783eb68-04ed-4dbc-b5a6-99a5bde1b6b3","uuid":"0e320196-3f7f-4c13-8018-ab5fe260ac75","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/AppStyle.md","content":"# App Design Reference — Forest Green (Linear-Inspired)\n\nDesign tokens and styles for a minimal, clean application interface.

Avoid pure/vivid hues.\n\n---\n\n## General Design Principles\n\n1. **Minimal and clean**: Very few visible borders; separation is achieved through background color contrast and whitespace.\n2. **Warm neutrals**: All grays are warm-shifted (slight brown/yellow undertone) rather than cool or pure. This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2.

The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    67→\n    68→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n    69→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions.

Handles GET all accounts, GET by id, DELETE account\n\nExpected (referenced in Redux slices but not yet created):\n- `reports.ts` - for report CRUD operations\n- `transactions.ts` - for transaction CRUD operations\n- `budgets.ts` - for budget CRUD operations\n\n**Database Connection Pattern (from accounts.ts):**\n```typescript\nimport { neon } from \"@neondatabase/serverless\"\nUses DATABASE_URL env variable → neon() → sql`` template literals\nExports default handler(req, context) → handles routing by HTTP method + URL segments\n```\n\n### 8. **Shared Components & Utilities**\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/shared/`\n\n**Shared Components (10 items):**\n1. `CategorySection.tsx/.css` - Collapsible category sections (used in Accounting for account grouping)\n2. `Breadcrumb.tsx/.css` - Navigation breadcrumbs\n3. `ConfirmDialog.tsx/.css` - Confirmation dialogs\n4. `Pagination.tsx/.css` -

Uses `createAsyncThunk` for API calls\n   - Async thunks handle loading/error states automatically\n   - Extra reducers handle fulfilled/rejected/pending states\n   - Clear naming: `fetchX`, `createX`, `updateX`, `deleteX`, `clearX`\n\n2. **Component Pattern:**\n   - Functional components with hooks\n   - Props interfaces defined\n   - `React.ReactElement` return type\n   - data-testid attributes for testing\n   - Use of `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` for Redux\n\n3. **CSS Pattern:**\n   - BEM-like class naming (.block, .block-element, .block--modifier)\n   - CSS variables for all colors/sizes\n   - CSS imports for shared styles\n   - Organized by feature/component\n\n4. **File Organization:**\n   - Components in components/ with clear responsibilities\n   - Pages in pages/ matching routes\n   - Slices in slices/ for Redux state\n   - Types in types/index.ts\n   - Shared code in ../../shared/\n\n### 14. **Reports Feature Status**\n\n**Existing Implementation:**\n- ✓ Redux slice (`reportsSlice.ts`) - fully implemented with CRUD operations\n- ✓ Dialog component (`CreateReportDialog.tsx`) - form for creating reports with fields for:\n  - Report name\n  - Report type (summary, detailed, budget_vs_actual)\n  - Date range (start/end)\n  - Categories filter\n  - Include zero-balance accounts checkbox\n- ✓ Reporting links (`ReportingLinks.tsx`) - buttons to open report creation dialog\n\n**Stub Pages (Need Implementation):**\n- **ReportListPage.tsx** - Currently shows \"To be implemented\" placeholder\n- **ReportDetailsPage.tsx** - Currently shows \"To be implemented\" placeholder\n\n**Missing Backend:**\n- `netlify/functions/reports.ts` - endpoint for report operations\n\n### 15. **Absolute File Paths Summary**\n\n**Key Source Files:**\n- `/repo/apps/Accounting/src/store.ts` -

Only the \"Expenses (All)\" top-level item remains visible. The arrow rotates to indicate the collapsed state.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter sub-category checkboxes are independently selectable**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open with \"Expenses\" expanded. All sub-categories are checked: \"Operating Expenses\" (checked), \"Cost of Goods Sold\" (checked), \"Non-Operating Expenses\" (checked).\n- **Action:** User unchecks the \"Non-Operating Expenses\" checkbox.\n- **Expected:** The \"Non-Operating Expenses\" checkbox becomes unchecked. \"Operating Expenses\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" remain checked. The parent \"Expenses (All)\" checkbox changes to an indeterminate/partial state (e.g., a dash or partial fill) indicating that not all sub-categories are selected.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter unchecking parent unchecks all sub-categories**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open with \"Expenses\" expanded. Some or all sub-categories are checked.\n- **Action:** User unchecks the \"Expenses (All)\" parent checkbox.\n- **Expected:** All sub-categories under Expenses (Operating Expenses, Cost of Goods Sold, Non-Operating Expenses) become unchecked. The entire Expenses category is excluded from the report filter.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter checking parent checks all sub-categories**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open with \"Expenses\" expanded. The \"Expenses (All)\" parent checkbox is unchecked and all sub-categories are unchecked.\n- **Action:** User checks the \"Expenses (All)\" parent checkbox.\n- **Expected:** All sub-categories under Expenses (Operating Expenses, Cost of Goods Sold, Non-Operating Expenses) become checked. The Expenses category with all sub-categories is included in the report filter.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter checking all sub-categories fills parent checkbox**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open with \"Expenses\" expanded. \"Operating Expenses\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\" are checked, but \"Non-Operating Expenses\" is unchecked. The parent shows an indeterminate state.\n- **Action:** User checks the \"Non-Operating Expenses\" checkbox.\n- **Expected:** The parent \"Expenses (All)\" checkbox transitions from the indeterminate state to a fully checked state, since all sub-categories are now selected.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter unchecking a top-level category removes it from report**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open with all categories checked. The preview shows data for all categories.\n- **Action:** User unchecks the \"Liabilities (All)\" checkbox.\n- **Expected:** The \"Liabilities (All)\" checkbox becomes unchecked. The report preview updates to exclude Liabilities data. All other categories remain checked and their data remains in the preview.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter Assets category is expandable with sub-categories**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open.\n- **Action:** User clicks the expand arrow next to \"Assets (All)\".\n- **Expected:** The Assets category expands to reveal its sub-categories (e.g., Current Assets, Fixed Assets, or specific asset accounts) as indented items with individual checkboxes.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter Include Zero Balance toggle is displayed**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open.\n- **Action:** User observes the area below the category tree.\n- **Expected:** A toggle switch is displayed with the label \"Include Zero Balance Accounts\" to its right. The toggle is in the off/disabled position by default.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter Include Zero Balance toggle is off by default**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is freshly opened.\n- **Action:** User observes the \"Include Zero Balance Accounts\" toggle.\n- **Expected:** The toggle switch is in the off position (e.g., gray/uncolored), meaning accounts with zero balance are excluded from the report by default.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter Include Zero Balance toggle can be turned on**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open with the \"Include Zero Balance Accounts\" toggle off.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Include Zero Balance Accounts\" toggle.\n- **Expected:** The toggle switches to the on position (e.g., colored/active). Accounts with zero balance will now be included in the generated report. The preview may update to show additional rows for zero-balance accounts.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter Include Zero Balance toggle can be turned off again**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open with the \"Include Zero Balance Accounts\" toggle on.\n- **Action:** User clicks the \"Include Zero Balance Accounts\" toggle again.\n- **Expected:** The toggle switches back to the off position. Zero-balance accounts are excluded from the report again.\n\n**Test: AccountCategoryFilter category selection updates preview data**\n- **Initial state:** The CreateReportDialog is open with all categories checked and the preview showing data for all categories.\n- **Action:** User unchecks \"Revenue (All)\" and \"Expenses (All)\".","numLines":80,"startLine":699,"totalLines":1246}}}

A section heading \"Filter Accounts & Categories\"\n2. Five top-level categories with checkboxes and expand/collapse arrows: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Expenses\n3. Sub-categories for each that can be expanded/collapsed\n4. Checkbox states: checked, unchecked, indeterminate\n5. Parent-child checkbox behavior (parent unchecks all children, etc.)\n6. \"Include Zero Balance Accounts\" toggle switch\n\nThe sub-categories mentioned in the tests:\n- Expenses: \"Operating Expenses\", \"Cost of Goods Sold\", \"Non-Operating Expenses\"\n\n\n- Assets: \"Current Assets\", \"Fixed Assets\"\n\nI notice the tests reference specific sub-categories that don't map directly to individual accounts in the database, so these must be predefined groupings. Since the schema doesn't have a sub-category field, I'll need to define standard accounting sub-categories statically for each top-level category.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the full category hierarchy with sub-categories for liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses. The component will need to track both which categories are selected and which ones are expanded, with the parent component managing this state since it affects the report preview.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2116,"cache_read_input_tokens":83502,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2116,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4783eb68-04ed-4dbc-b5a6-99a5bde1b6b3","uuid":"fbe4e518-c0ae-4981-8fe0-745a48067976"}
