Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"af064ad8-d415-449b-809b-97262f6720bc","uuid":"9657b147-33b2-4391-98ef-5f816732ccb7","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n","numLines":360,"startLine":1,"totalLines":360}}}

(2) Recipe and raw materials section listing each material required, the amount needed for the planned quantity, and units. (3) Forecast/availability section showing projected inventory levels for each material at the time of the run, based on data from the separate inventory tracking and delivery scheduling apps.

You will build and/or maintain one or more\n     4→web apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n     5→\n     6→Key directories:\n     7→\n     8→* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n     9→* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n    10→* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n    24→3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    25→   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    26→\n    27→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    28→matching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    29→\n    30→## Worker Execution\n    31→\n    32→The worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    39→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    40→\n    41→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    42→\n    43→## Task System\n    44→\n    45→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→and a `timestamp`:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    60→    }\n    61→  ]\n    62→}\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    66→\n    67→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\"`**:\n    68→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    69→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    70→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    71→\n    72→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    73→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    74→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    75→\n    76→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    77→\n    78→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    79→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    80→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    81→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    82→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    83→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    84→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    85→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    86→\n    87→## Tech Stack\n    88→\n    89→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    90→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    91→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    92→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    93→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    94→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    95→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    96→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    97→\n    98→## Database\n    99→\n   100→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   101→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   102→frontend components.\n   103→\n   104→## Quality Gates\n   105→\n   106→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\n   107→code that fails typecheck or lint.\n   108→\n   109→## Commits\n   110→\n   111→The worker commits automatically after each iteration.

Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me compile a thorough report.\n\n## ProductionHub Codebase Exploration Report\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the /repo/apps/ProductionHub directory and related app infrastructure, here's a comprehensive analysis:\n\n### 1. CURRENT STATE OF PRODUCTIENHUB\n\nThe ProductionHub directory currently contains **only documentation and mockups**, not a complete application:\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/`\n\n**Files:**\n- `AppSpec.md` - Complete specification with all pages and descriptions\n- `docs/mockup-*.png` - UI mockups for all pages\n- `docs/tests.md` - Test specification\n\n**No source code exists yet.** The app needs to be built from scratch.\n\n---\n\n### 2. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE TO CREATE\n\nBased on the InventoryTracker pattern, ProductionHub should follow this structure:\n\n```\nProductionHub/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/          # Reusable UI components\n│   ├── pages/               # Page components\n│   ├── slices/              # Redux slices for state management\n│   ├── types/               # TypeScript interfaces\n│   ├── hooks.ts             # Custom hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector)\n│   ├── store.ts             # Redux store configuration\n│   ├── App.tsx              # Main app routing\n│   ├── main.tsx             # App entry point\n│   └── index.css            # Global styles\n├── netlify/functions/       # Serverless backend functions\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── schema.ts            # Database schema initialization\n│   ├── seed-db.ts           # Database seeding (optional)\n│   ├── check.ts             # Linting & type checking\n│   ├── deploy.ts            # Deployment script\n│   └── test.ts              # Test runner\n├── tests/                   # Playwright tests\n├── vite.config.ts           # Vite configuration\n├── tsconfig.json            # TypeScript configuration\n├── package.json             # Dependencies\n├── .env                     # Environment variables (DATABASE_URL, etc.)\n└── playwright.config.ts     # Test configuration\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. PAGES TO BUILD (FROM APPSPEC.MD)\n\n1. **RecipesPage** (`/recipes`)\n   - Table/list of recipes with name, product, version, status\n   - Add/edit/delete controls\n   - Click to open RecipeDetailsPage or modal\n   - Filtering and search by name/product\n\n2. **CalendarPage** (`/calendar`)\n   - Daily/weekly/monthly calendar view\n   - Production runs shown as events/blocks\n   - Click to create new run or view details\n   - Event shows: product/recipe name, quantity, status\n   - Navigation controls\n   - Drag-and-drop to reschedule (optional)\n\n3. **RunDetailsPage** (`/runs/:runId`)\n   - High-level run info (ID, date/time, product, recipe, quantity, status)\n   - Recipe and raw materials section\n   - Forecast/availability section (material quantities)\n   - Equipment requirements and availability\n   - Adjust quantities, confirm/cancel run\n\n4. **RecipeDetailsPage** (`/recipe/:recipeId`)\n   - Title, description\n   - Raw materials (with amounts required per batch)\n   - Products and amounts that result\n   - Equipment required (references equipment page)\n\n5. **EquipmentPage** (`/equipment`)\n   - Table with equipment entries\n   - Each entry: title, description, count of available units\n   - \"Add equipment\" button\n\n6. **EquipmentDetailsPage** (`/equipment/:id`)\n   - Title, description, optional photo\n   - Comment system for adding notes over time\n\n---\n\n### 4. DATABASE SCHEMA PATTERN\n\nFollowing `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/scripts/schema.ts`, the pattern is:\n\n**Schema structure:**\n- UUID primary keys with `gen_random_uuid()`\n- `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamptz fields\n- Status enums with CHECK constraints\n- Proper foreign keys with ON DELETE CASCADE where appropriate\n- Indexes on frequently queried columns\n\n**For ProductionHub, you'll need tables for:**\n- `recipes` (name, description, status, created_at, updated_at)\n- `recipe_materials` (recipe_id, material_id, quantity_needed, unit) - many-to-many\n- `recipe_products` (recipe_id, product_name, quantity_produced, unit)\n- `recipe_equipment` (recipe_id, equipment_id) - many-to-many\n- `production_runs` (recipe_id, scheduled_date, quantity, status, created_at, updated_at)\n- `equipment` (name, description, total_units, available_units, created_at, updated_at)\n- `equipment_comments` (equipment_id, comment, created_by, created_at)\n\n**Schema file location:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/scripts/schema.ts`\n\n---\n\n### 5. REDUX STORE SETUP PATTERN\n\n**Store configuration** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/store.ts`):\n\n```typescript\nimport { createAppStore } from \"@shared/store/store\";\nimport { authReducer } from \"@shared/auth/authSlice\";\nimport { recipesReducer } from \"./slices/recipesSlice\";\nimport { runsReducer } from \"./slices/runsSlice\";\nimport { equipmentReducer } from \"./slices/equipmentSlice\";\n\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  reducer: {\n    auth: authReducer,\n    recipes: recipesReducer,\n    runs: runsReducer,\n    equipment: equipmentReducer,\n  },\n});\n\nexport type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;\nexport type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;\n```\n\n**Redux slice pattern** (each in `slices/`):\n- Uses `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`\n- Async thunks call `/.netlify/functions/[resource]` endpoints\n- Each thunk handles GET, POST, PUT methods\n- State includes: items[], currentItem, loading, error\n\n**Example structure:**\n```typescript\n// slices/recipesSlice.ts\nexport const fetchRecipes = createAsyncThunk(\"recipes/fetchRecipes\", async () => {\n  const res = await fetch(\"/.netlify/functions/recipes\");\n  return (await res.json()) as Recipe[];\n});\n\nexport const fetchRecipeById = createAsyncThunk(\"recipes/fetchRecipeById\", \n  async (id: string) => {\n    const res = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/recipes/${id}`);\n    return (await res.json()) as Recipe;\n  }\n);\n\n// Similar patterns for create, update, delete...\n```\n\n**Custom hooks** (`src/hooks.ts`):\n```typescript\nimport { useDispatch, useSelector } from \"react-redux\";\nimport type { RootState, AppDispatch } from \"./store\";\n\nexport const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();\nexport const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. NETLIFY FUNCTIONS PATTERN\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/netlify/functions/`\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- ESM modules with `default export async function handler(req: Request, _context: Context)`\n- Use `@neondatabase/serverless` neon client for database queries\n- Query parameter handling via `new URL(req.url).searchParams`\n- JSON request body parsing with `await req.json()`\n- Proper error handling with try/catch\n- Response with JSON headers: `{ \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }`\n\n**Example function structure** (`recipes.ts`):\n```typescript\nimport { neon } from \"@neondatabase/serverless\";\nimport type { Context } from \"@netlify/functions\";\n\nexport default async function handler(req: Request, _context: Context) {\n  const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;\n  if (!dbUrl) {\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"DATABASE_URL not set\" }), {\n      status: 500,\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    });\n  }\n\n  const sql = neon(dbUrl);\n\n  if (req.method === \"GET\") {\n    // Fetch logic\n  }\n  if (req.method === \"POST\") {\n    // Create logic\n  }\n  if (req.method === \"PUT\") {\n    // Update logic\n  }\n  if (req.method === \"DELETE\") {\n    // Delete logic\n  }\n\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Method not allowed\" }), {\n    status: 405,\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**Functions needed:**\n- `recipes.ts` - GET all, GET by id, POST, PUT, DELETE\n- `equipment.ts` - GET all, GET by id, POST, PUT, DELETE\n- `production-runs.ts` - GET all, GET by id, POST, PUT, DELETE\n- `equipment-comments.ts` - POST, GET by equipment_id, DELETE\n\n---\n\n### 7. COMPONENT PATTERNS\n\n**Data attributes for testing** (every interactive element):\n```typescript\ndata-testid=\"component-name\"\ndata-testid=\"button-action-name\"\ndata-testid=\"table-row-id\"\n```\n\n**Component structure example:**\n```typescript\ninterface ComponentProps {\n  items: Item[];\n  onItemClick?: (id: string) => void;\n  onDelete?: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\nexport function Component({ items, onItemClick, onDelete }: ComponentProps) {\n  return (\n    <div data-testid=\"component-name\" className=\"section-card\">\n      <div className=\"section-card-header\">\n        <h2 className=\"section-card-title\">Component Title</h2>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"section-card-body\">\n        {items.length === 0 ? (\n          <div className=\"empty-state\">No items</div>\n        ) : (\n          <table className=\"data-table\">\n            <thead>\n              <tr>\n                <th>Column 1</th>\n                <th>Column 2</th>\n              </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n              {items.map((item) => (\n                <tr key={item.id} className=\"clickable\">\n                  <td>{item.field1}</td>\n                  <td>{item.field2}</td>\n                </tr>\n              ))}\n            </tbody>\n          </table>\n        )}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8.

Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me compile a thorough report.\n\n## ProductionHub Codebase Exploration Report\n\nBased on my thorough exploration of the /repo/apps/ProductionHub directory and related app infrastructure, here's a comprehensive analysis:\n\n### 1. CURRENT STATE OF PRODUCTIENHUB\n\nThe ProductionHub directory currently contains **only documentation and mockups**, not a complete application:\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/`\n\n**Files:**\n- `AppSpec.md` - Complete specification with all pages and descriptions\n- `docs/mockup-*.png` - UI mockups for all pages\n- `docs/tests.md` - Test specification\n\n**No source code exists yet.** The app needs to be built from scratch.\n\n---\n\n### 2. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE TO CREATE\n\nBased on the InventoryTracker pattern, ProductionHub should follow this structure:\n\n```\nProductionHub/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/          # Reusable UI components\n│   ├── pages/               # Page components\n│   ├── slices/              # Redux slices for state management\n│   ├── types/               # TypeScript interfaces\n│   ├── hooks.ts             # Custom hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector)\n│   ├── store.ts             # Redux store configuration\n│   ├── App.tsx              # Main app routing\n│   ├── main.tsx             # App entry point\n│   └── index.css            # Global styles\n├── netlify/functions/       # Serverless backend functions\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── schema.ts            # Database schema initialization\n│   ├── seed-db.ts           # Database seeding (optional)\n│   ├── check.ts             # Linting & type checking\n│   ├── deploy.ts            # Deployment script\n│   └── test.ts              # Test runner\n├── tests/                   # Playwright tests\n├── vite.config.ts           # Vite configuration\n├── tsconfig.json            # TypeScript configuration\n├── package.json             # Dependencies\n├── .env                     # Environment variables (DATABASE_URL, etc.)\n└── playwright.config.ts     # Test configuration\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. PAGES TO BUILD (FROM APPSPEC.MD)\n\n1. **RecipesPage** (`/recipes`)\n   - Table/list of recipes with name, product, version, status\n   - Add/edit/delete controls\n   - Click to open RecipeDetailsPage or modal\n   - Filtering and search by name/product\n\n2. **CalendarPage** (`/calendar`)\n   - Daily/weekly/monthly calendar view\n   - Production runs shown as events/blocks\n   - Click to create new run or view details\n   - Event shows: product/recipe name, quantity, status\n   - Navigation controls\n   - Drag-and-drop to reschedule (optional)\n\n3. **RunDetailsPage** (`/runs/:runId`)\n   - High-level run info (ID, date/time, product, recipe, quantity, status)\n   - Recipe and raw materials section\n   - Forecast/availability section (material quantities)\n   - Equipment requirements and availability\n   - Adjust quantities, confirm/cancel run\n\n4. **RecipeDetailsPage** (`/recipe/:recipeId`)\n   - Title, description\n   - Raw materials (with amounts required per batch)\n   - Products and amounts that result\n   - Equipment required (references equipment page)\n\n5. **EquipmentPage** (`/equipment`)\n   - Table with equipment entries\n   - Each entry: title, description, count of available units\n   - \"Add equipment\" button\n\n6. **EquipmentDetailsPage** (`/equipment/:id`)\n   - Title, description, optional photo\n   - Comment system for adding notes over time\n\n---\n\n### 4. DATABASE SCHEMA PATTERN\n\nFollowing `/repo/apps/InventoryTracker/scripts/schema.ts`, the pattern is:\n\n**Schema structure:**\n- UUID primary keys with `gen_random_uuid()`\n- `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamptz fields\n- Status enums with CHECK constraints\n- Proper foreign keys with ON DELETE CASCADE where appropriate\n- Indexes on frequently queried columns\n\n**For ProductionHub, you'll need tables for:**\n- `recipes` (name, description, status, created_at, updated_at)\n- `recipe_materials` (recipe_id, material_id, quantity_needed, unit) - many-to-many\n- `recipe_products` (recipe_id, product_name, quantity_produced, unit)\n- `recipe_equipment` (recipe_id, equipment_id) - many-to-many\n- `production_runs` (recipe_id, scheduled_date, quantity, status, created_at, updated_at)\n- `equipment` (name, description, total_units, available_units, created_at, updated_at)\n- `equipment_comments` (equipment_id, comment, created_by, created_at)\n\n**Schema file location:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/scripts/schema.ts`\n\n---\n\n### 5. REDUX STORE SETUP PATTERN\n\n**Store configuration** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/store.ts`):\n\n```typescript\nimport { createAppStore } from \"@shared/store/store\";\nimport { authReducer } from \"@shared/auth/authSlice\";\nimport { recipesReducer } from \"./slices/recipesSlice\";\nimport { runsReducer } from \"./slices/runsSlice\";\nimport { equipmentReducer } from \"./slices/equipmentSlice\";\n\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  reducer: {\n    auth: authReducer,\n    recipes: recipesReducer,\n    runs: runsReducer,\n    equipment: equipmentReducer,\n  },\n});\n\nexport type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;\nexport type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;\n```\n\n**Redux slice pattern** (each in `slices/`):\n- Uses `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`\n- Async thunks call `/.netlify/functions/[resource]` endpoints\n- Each thunk handles GET, POST, PUT methods\n- State includes: items[], currentItem, loading, error\n\n**Example structure:**\n```typescript\n// slices/recipesSlice.ts\nexport const fetchRecipes = createAsyncThunk(\"recipes/fetchRecipes\", async () => {\n  const res = await fetch(\"/.netlify/functions/recipes\");\n  return (await res.json()) as Recipe[];\n});\n\nexport const fetchRecipeById = createAsyncThunk(\"recipes/fetchRecipeById\", \n  async (id: string) => {\n    const res = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/recipes/${id}`);\n    return (await res.json()) as Recipe;\n  }\n);\n\n// Similar patterns for create, update, delete...\n```\n\n**Custom hooks** (`src/hooks.ts`):\n```typescript\nimport { useDispatch, useSelector } from \"react-redux\";\nimport type { RootState, AppDispatch } from \"./store\";\n\nexport const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();\nexport const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. NETLIFY FUNCTIONS PATTERN\n\n**Location:** `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/netlify/functions/`\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- ESM modules with `default export async function handler(req: Request, _context: Context)`\n- Use `@neondatabase/serverless` neon client for database queries\n- Query parameter handling via `new URL(req.url).searchParams`\n- JSON request body parsing with `await req.json()`\n- Proper error handling with try/catch\n- Response with JSON headers: `{ \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }`\n\n**Example function structure** (`recipes.ts`):\n```typescript\nimport { neon } from \"@neondatabase/serverless\";\nimport type { Context } from \"@netlify/functions\";\n\nexport default async function handler(req: Request, _context: Context) {\n  const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;\n  if (!dbUrl) {\n    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"DATABASE_URL not set\" }), {\n      status: 500,\n      headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n    });\n  }\n\n  const sql = neon(dbUrl);\n\n  if (req.method === \"GET\") {\n    // Fetch logic\n  }\n  if (req.method === \"POST\") {\n    // Create logic\n  }\n  if (req.method === \"PUT\") {\n    // Update logic\n  }\n  if (req.method === \"DELETE\") {\n    // Delete logic\n  }\n\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Method not allowed\" }), {\n    status: 405,\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**Functions needed:**\n- `recipes.ts` - GET all, GET by id, POST, PUT, DELETE\n- `equipment.ts` - GET all, GET by id, POST, PUT, DELETE\n- `production-runs.ts` - GET all, GET by id, POST, PUT, DELETE\n- `equipment-comments.ts` - POST, GET by equipment_id, DELETE\n\n---\n\n### 7. COMPONENT PATTERNS\n\n**Data attributes for testing** (every interactive element):\n```typescript\ndata-testid=\"component-name\"\ndata-testid=\"button-action-name\"\ndata-testid=\"table-row-id\"\n```\n\n**Component structure example:**\n```typescript\ninterface ComponentProps {\n  items: Item[];\n  onItemClick?: (id: string) => void;\n  onDelete?: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\nexport function Component({ items, onItemClick, onDelete }: ComponentProps) {\n  return (\n    <div data-testid=\"component-name\" className=\"section-card\">\n      <div className=\"section-card-header\">\n        <h2 className=\"section-card-title\">Component Title</h2>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"section-card-body\">\n        {items.length === 0 ? (\n          <div className=\"empty-state\">No items</div>\n        ) : (\n          <table className=\"data-table\">\n            <thead>\n              <tr>\n                <th>Column 1</th>\n                <th>Column 2</th>\n              </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n              {items.map((item) => (\n                <tr key={item.id} className=\"clickable\">\n                  <td>{item.field1}</td>\n                  <td>{item.field2}</td>\n                </tr>\n              ))}\n            </tbody>\n          </table>\n        )}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 8. CSS/STYLING APPROACH\n\n**Global styles import hierarchy** (in `src/index.css`):\n```css\n@import \"@shared/styles/tokens.css\";\n@import \"@shared/styles/layout.css\";\n@import \"@shared/styles/common.css\";\n```\n\n**CSS variables from** `/repo/apps/shared/styles/tokens.css`:\n- **Backgrounds:** `--bg-sidebar-color`, `--bg-base-color`, `--bg-border-color`\n- **Accent:** `--accent-primary` (#4d7c5e), `--accent-dark`, `--accent-light`\n- **Text:** `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--text-muted`, `--text-disabled`\n- **Status:** `--status-success`, `--status-warning`, `--status-error`, `--status-info`\n- **Sizing:** `--sidebar-width: 240px`, `--control-border-radius: 4px`\n\n**CSS classes available:**\n- `.page-content` - Main page container\n- `.page-header` - Title and actions area\n- `.section-card` - Card container with header/body/footer\n- `.data-table` - Styled table\n- `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-ghost`, `.btn-danger` - Buttons\n- `.badge`, `.badge--active`, `.badge--warning`, etc. - Status badges\n- `.form-input`, `.form-textarea` - Form elements\n- `.modal-overlay`, `.modal-content` - Modal styling\n\n---\n\n### 9. APP ROUTING SETUP\n\n**App.tsx pattern** (from InventoryTracker):\n```typescript\nimport { Routes, Route, Navigate } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport { NavigationHeader } from \"./components/NavigationHeader\";\nimport { RecipesPage } from \"./pages/RecipesPage\";\nimport { RecipeDetailsPage } from \"./pages/RecipeDetailsPage\";\n// ... etc\n\nexport function App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <NavigationHeader />\n      <Routes>\n        <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navigate to=\"/recipes\" replace />} />\n        <Route path=\"/recipes\" element={<RecipesPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/recipe/:recipeId\" element={<RecipeDetailsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/calendar\" element={<CalendarPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/runs/:runId\" element={<RunDetailsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/equipment\" element={<EquipmentPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"/equipment/:id\" element={<EquipmentDetailsPage />} />\n        <Route path=\"*\" element={<Navigate to=\"/\" replace />} />\n      </Routes>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Navigation header pattern** (`NavigationHeader.tsx`):\n- Logo with app name\n- Navigation links for each main page\n- User avatar and name in top right\n- Active link styling\n\n---\n\n### 10.

But my task is specifically to write EquipmentDetailsPage components. This means I need to set up the entire app first before I can write those components - or, wait, maybe there's a \"SetupApp\" task and \"DesignDatabase\" task that should have been done first. Let me re-read the task:\n\n\"Subtasks to complete:\n1. WriteComponentEquipmentDetailHeader: Write the EquipmentDetailHeader component\n2. WriteComponentEquipmentInfo: Write the EquipmentInfo component\n3. WriteComponentMaintenanceNotes: Write the MaintenanceNotes component\n\n\n4. WritePageEquipmentDetails: Write the EquipmentDetailsPage itself\"\n\nLooking at the skill instructions, the skill says to write clean, working code. But there's no app to write components into yet. I need to understand the task queue and if setup has been done.\n\nActually, checking the git log shows that the app structure and shared code have already been set up in previous commits, so I can start writing the components directly. I see the pattern now—the Unpack task created the structure, but the actual app code hasn't been built yet. My specific assignments are to write the EquipmentDetailsPage components, but I need to first establish the foundational infrastructure like the database schema, Redux store, and API endpoints before I can implement those components. I need to look at the mockup for the equipment details page to understand what components I'm building and how they should fit together.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_toke

Let me check if SetupApp is already queued before I start building all of this from scratch.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3234,"cache_read_input_tokens":64274,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3234,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"af064ad8-d415-449b-809b-97262f6720bc","uuid":"2f5dee00-e5ed-4740-a984-f087838c140a"}

This ordering is wrong - the SetupApp should come before writing components. But per the instructions, I must work on my assigned subtasks.

My current task is at position 1. So the ordering has my EquipmentDetailsPage components before the app setup - that's clearly wrong.

Let me plan what I need to build:\n\nSince the ProductionHub app has NO source code at all, I need to:\n\n1. Set up the app infrastructure:\n   - package.json\n   - vite.config.ts\n   - tsconfig.json\n   - netlify.toml\n   - src/main.tsx\n   - src/App.tsx (with routing - at least for equipment details page)\n   - src/store.ts\n   - src/hooks.ts\n   - src/types/index.ts\n   - src/index.css\n   - scripts/schema.ts (at least the equipment-related tables)\n   - index.html\n\n2. Build the equipment backend with serverless functions for CRUD operations on equipment and comments, then create the Redux slice to manage equipment state.\n\n3. Build out the UI components for the equipment details page and set up navigation to tie everything together.\n\nLooking at the mockup, I can see the sidebar layout with the FactoryFlow logo, main navigation items like Dashboard and Equipment, and the user profile at the bottom. The main content area displays the equipment details with the title and operational status badge, breadcrumb navigation, a large equipment photo on the left, and the details section on the right showing specs like model, serial number, location, and installation date. Below that is the maintenance notes and comments section.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the test specifications for the different components. The EquipmentDetailHeader needs to handle the breadcrumb navigation, page title, and status badges for both operational and maintenance states. The EquipmentInfo section covers the photo display with upload capability, the details panel with editable fields, and the description text. The MaintenanceNotes component will handle the heading and content for that section.\n\nFor the notes functionality, I need a text input field with a post button that's disabled when empty, and the ability to display comments in reverse chronological order showing author, role, date, and text. System-generated notes should also be supported.\n\nDefining the database schema...\n\nNow I'm thinking through the equipment ID format—the spec shows user-friendly text IDs like \"E-4021\" rather than UUIDs, so I need to make sure the schema reflects that. I'm also noticing I should check how the InventoryTracker handles IDs to keep things consistent. I need to decide between using UUID as the primary key with a separate display ID, or just using the human-readable ID directly. The tests reference \"E-4021\" in the URL and don't show an ID field in the creation form, so the ID must be auto-generated. I'll go with UUID as the primary key and add a display_id field that gets auto-generated, then use that in the routes instead of the UUID. Looking at the test again, the URL definitely needs to be `/equipment/E-4021`, so I'll use UUID as the primary key in the database but add a `code` column with the human-readable format that gets used in the routes and displayed in the UI. I'll add a `code` field to store the human-readable identifier like \"E-4021\", then use the UUID as the primary key in the database while keeping the URL structure simple with `/equipment/:id`. The display will show the code alongside the name for readability, but the routing stays straightforward with UUIDs. I'm settling on UUID primary keys across the board—the tests can work with whatever ID the API returns, and \"E-4021\" is just an example placeholder. Now I need to define the equipment table schema with fields for id, name, description, available units, and status.\n\nDefining the equipment_notes table to track changes with equipment_id as a foreign key, plus author info and timestamps. For the sidebar, I'm mapping out the navigation structure with FactoryFlow branding, Dashboard, Equipment as the active section, and Reports.\n\nNow I'm looking at the actual app pages from the spec—Recipes, Calendar, Equipment, and their detail pages—and realizing the navigation should prioritize these core sections. I'll align the sidebar with both the mockup and the spec requirements, starting with Recipes, Calendar, and Equipment as the main nav items.\n\nSetting up the project structure... I'm thinking through what tables the database schema needs to support the full app—recipes with their materials and products, production runs with material forecasts, and equipment tracking with all the necessary relationships.\n\nNow I'm ready to start building the code for the EquipmentDetailsPage, focusing on matching the existing patterns and making sure the data attributes are correct. I notice the mockup uses a sidebar layout rather than a top navigation, and there's already an AppLayout component in the shared folder that handles this pattern, so I'll leverage that for

The equipment page mockup shows a TOP NAVBAR (not a sidebar like the equipment detail page mockup). Let me re-examine the equipment details mockup. Looking again at the mockup:\n\nThe equipment details mockup shows:\n- A SIDEBAR layout with \"FactoryFlow\" logo and nav items (Dashboard, Equipment active, Reports, Settings)\n- User \"A. Chen\" at bottom\n\nBut the equipment page mockup shows:\n- A TOP NAVBAR with \"ProRun Manager\" logo and nav items (Dashboard, Production Runs, Equipment, Reports)\n- User \"A. Smith\" and search icon at top rightSo there are TWO different mockups with different layouts. \n\nThese appear to be from different applications entirely—the equipment details page uses a sidebar with \"FactoryFlow\" branding while the equipment page uses a top navbar with \"ProRun Manager\" branding. Since both should be part of ProductionHub, I need to determine which layout is the correct one to follow, and the page identifiers might help clarify which design system I should be using. I'm looking at the equipment details mockup more carefully now—it clearly shows a sidebar layout with the navigation on the left and the main content area displaying the equipment information. That's the pattern I should follow for consistency, especially since this is the page I'm actually building.\n\nI'll create a NavigationSidebar component to handle the left-side navigation.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the project structure I need to build—starting with the core configuration files like package.json, vite.config, and tsconfig, then moving into the source files including the main entry point, App component, Redux store setup, and custom hooks. I'm organizing these 20 files into dependency groups so I can write them in the right order—starting with infrastructure like config files, then the core app setup, backend functions, Redux slices, and finally the React components that tie everything together.\n\nLooking at the mockup, I need to make sure the sidebar displays the FactoryFlow logo with a factory icon and navigation items like Dashboard and Equipment with their respective icons, and I'll need to verify that all JSX is properly abstracted into separate component files that match the visual design. all the main pages from the spec. I'm noticing the mockups show different navigation structures, but since I'm building from scratch, I'll stick with what's actually in the AppSpec and use a consistent sidebar across the app. The main navigation will be Recipes, Calendar, and Equipment, and I'll call the app \"ProductionHub\" to match the directory name.\n\nNow I'm ready to start building. I need to define the TypeScript interfaces for Equipment and EquipmentNote...\n\nDefining the type schemas...\n\nI'm thinking through the scope here—I should define all the database tables in the schema since that's the single source of truth, but only create TypeScript types for what I actually need right now for the equipment detail page. Other features can add their types later as needed.\n\nFor the sidebar, I'm matching the mockup with a darker background, logo at the top, navigation items with icons, and a user section at the bottom using shared CSS classes. I also need to figure out the npm dependencies: core packages like React, React Router, Redux Toolkit, and the Neon database client, plus dev dependencies for Vite and React plugin support.\n\nSince ProductionHub has its own package.json and node_modules like InventoryTracker, I'll need to install dependencies after setting up the file structure. Let me start organizing the directory layout and creating the necessary files. I'll start by creating the infrastructure files using the Write tool, which will handle directory creation

The breadcrumb would show \"Details: {uuid}\" and the title would show \"CNC Mill {uuid}\".\n\nThe \"E-4021\" is just the example ID in the test spec. The actual tests will use whatever ID the API returns. So using UUID is fine.\n\nBut wait - the test says `equipment.id.substring(0, 8)` in my code - that would show the first 8 chars of the UUID. The tests expect the FULL ID to be shown in the breadcrumb and title. Let me use the full ID.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The test expects:\n- Breadcrumb: \"Details: E-4021\" \n- Title: \"CNC Mill E-4021\"\n\nWith UUIDs like \"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\", the breadcrumb would be \"Details: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\" which is pretty unwieldy. But looking at the RunDetailsPage test, it uses \"RUN-12345\" as the run ID in the URL, so if I'm using UUIDs, the tests would just use the UUID as the identifier. I think the pragmatic approach is to accept that the display won't be as polished and just use the full UUID. Actually, I should just grab the route parameter `:id` directly from the URL instead of manipulating it.\n\nThe breadcrumb should display \"Equipment\" > \"Details: {id}\" where {id} comes from the route parameter, and the title should show \"{equipment.name} {id}\" using that same route parameter. But the mockup shows \"E-4021\" as a separate identifier, not the UUID. Maybe I should add a `code` field to the equipment table for a human-readable identifier like \"E-4021\" that gets auto-generated when equipment is created.\n\nActually, let me keep this simple and just follow what the test spec requires. The test explicitly states the page title must display both the name and ID together, so I need to format it as \"{name} {id}\". With UUIDs, this would look like \"CNC Mill a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-...\" which isn't ideal, but that's what the test expects.\n\nThe real question is whether to use UUIDs as the primary key or switch to text-based IDs like \"E-4021\" so the test data is cleaner. Using text IDs would require the POST endpoint to either accept an ID parameter or auto-generate one, which adds complexity. UUIDs are simpler from an API perspective, even if the resulting page title is longer.\n\nActually, since the Playwright tests haven't been written yet, I'm overthinking this. The test spec is just guidance for what the UI should look like, not a literal implementation I need to match exactly. I'll go with UUIDs as the primary key and display a truncated version (first 8 characters) in the UI for readability. The page can show the equipment name as the title with a status badge, and the breadcrumb can reference the truncated ID. I can simplify this by just using the `equipment.id` from the response data directly, since it's the same UUID that's in the URL parameter anyway. Let me update the EquipmentDetailHeader component to display the equipment name alongside the ID in the title, and show \"Details: {id}\" in the breadcrumb.","signature":"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

Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→    55→\n    56→    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→    59→\n    60→    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→    66→\n    67→    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    69→    69→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    70→    70→\n    71→    71→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    72→    72→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→    74→\n    75→    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→    78→\n    79→    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→    81→\n    82→    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→    85→\n    86→    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→    89→\n    90→    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→    93→\n    94→    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→    96→\n    97→    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→   100→\n   101→   101→## Tips\n   102→   102→\n   103→   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→   106→  ```ts\n   107→   107→  build: {\n   108→   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→   109→    minify: false,\n   110→   110→  },\n   111→   111→  define: {\n   112→   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→   113→  },\n   114→   114→  ```\n   115→   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→   139→\n   140→   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips).

No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data. All features must be real and fully functional end-to-end, backed by the database.\n    27→- All JSX rendered on a page must be abstracted into other React components with their own files.\n    28→- Check for style guides at both `apps/AppStyle.md` (shared across all apps) and `apps/<AppName>/AppStyle.md` (app-specific). Read both if they exist and use them to style the pages and components appropriately. The app-specific style guide takes precedence when they conflict. Prefer using CSS files with style variables instead of hardcoded styles.\n    29→- Check for reusable library and component code in `apps/shared` and use these when appropriate. Set up the app build system so it can use code from this directory.\n    30→\n    31→## Database Schema\n    32→\n    33→The app MUST have a reusable `initSchema` function exported from a shared module (e.g.,\n    34→`scripts/schema.ts`). This is the single source of truth for the database schema, used by\n    35→the test and deploy scripts (see `skills/scripts/test.md` and `skills/scripts/deploy.md`).\n    36→\n    37→**Requirements for `initSchema`**:\n    38→\n    39→- Exported function that accepts a database URL string and returns a Promise. It must NOT read\n    40→  `DATABASE_URL` from the environment or `.env` — the caller passes the URL.\n    41→- Must use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all tables, making it idempotent and safe to re-run.\n    42→- Must create all tables, indices, and constraints needed by the app.\n    43→- When a new table or column is added to the app, it MUST be added to `initSchema`. There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect. Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\n    48→contexts (testing, deployment).\n    49→\n    50→## Directives\n    51→\n    52→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    53→\n    54→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    64→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    65→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    66→\n    67→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    68→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    69→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    70→\n    71→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    72→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    73→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    74→\n    75→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    76→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    77→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    78→\n    79→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    80→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    81→\n    82→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→","numLines":145,"startLine":1,"totalLines":145}}}

[2026-02-25T00:10:10.758Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Qof9x2FN7BtEBcoK8wcfRN","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"I've reviewed the test spec. Let me verify my components match all the requirements:\n\n**ED-HDR-1**: Breadcrumb \"Equipment\" > \"Details: E-4021\" - My implementation uses `equipment.id` which would be a UUID. The test expects \"E-4021\" but in practice it'll be the UUID. The breadcrumb shows \"Details: {equipment.id}\" which is correct.  ✓\n\n**ED-HDR-2**: Title \"CNC Mill E-4021\" - My implementation shows `{equipment.name} {equipment.id}`. ✓\n\n**ED-HDR-3**: Green \"Operational\" badge - I use `badge badge--operational` with green CSS. ✓\n\n\n**ED-HDR-4**: Yellow \"Maintenance\" badge - I use `badge badge--maintenance` with yellow CSS. ✓\n\nFor the equipment info section, I've got the photo displayed prominently on the left with click-to-upload functionality and a placeholder for when there's no image. The details panel shows all required fields like Model, Serial No., Location, Manufacturer, and Installation Date, with an Edit button that toggles the fields to editable mode before saving changes.\n\nI'm noticing the test expects separate edit interactions for the details panel versus the description section, but my current implementation combines them into one edit mode. However, this still satisfies the requirements since the description editing is included in the form and users can modify it through the same edit interaction. Looking at the test requirements more carefully, ED-INFO-5 and ED-INFO-7 are testing separate edit interactions—one for the details panel and one for the description section. My current approach of making everything editable through a single \"Edit\" button should satisfy both tests since they'll each find their respective edit button and trigger the same editing mode. But I need to verify this actually works as expected.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the description section needs its own dedicated edit button for ED-INFO-7 to pass. I should split the editing into two separate states—one for details and one for description—so each section can be edited independently with its own control. I also need to fix a potential issue with my component where I'm initializing state from props without syncing updates, which means changes to the prop won't reflect in the local state. I'm verifying that the MaintenanceNotes component properly implements all the requirements—the heading, input field with placeholder, post button that clears on submit, disabled state when empty, and displaying author, role, date, and text in reverse chronological order from the backend. Now I need to check that the EquipmentDetailsPage has the correct padding applied to its root element as specified in the skill requirements. Looking at the mockup structure more carefully, I need to ensure consistent padding across all sections—the breadcrumb spans full width with its own padding, while the title, photo details, and maintenance notes should all align with the same left padding. Let me standardize the padding approach across the EquipmentDetailsPage components. I need to restructure the page layout so padding is controlled at the page level rather than in individual components, keeping the header separate since it has its own internal spacing needs. I need to step back and look at the actual padding structure across all these components. The header has its own inline styles, EquipmentInfo has none, MaintenanceNotes has inline padding, and the page wrapper adds more padding around EquipmentInfo—it's a mess. Let me strip out all the inconsistent inline padding and establish a single wrapper approach where the page component handles horizontal padding for the content sections below the header. I need to make sure the root element of EquipmentDetailsPage itself has the proper padding class to satisfy the requirement, rather than relying on the nested page-content

This isn't ideal since the page content below has `padding: 24px` from `.page-content`. The title should align with the content. Since the breadcrumb has `padding: 10px 24px` from CSS, and the `.page-content` has `padding: 24px`, the title area's `padding: 20px 24px 0` matches horizontally but adds some vertical padding between the breadcrumb and the title.\n\nThis is actually correct - the title area needs some top padding after the breadcrumb. \n\nThe left padding of 24px aligns perfectly with the content below, and the mockup confirms there should be space between the breadcrumb and title. Let me check that I have all the necessary files in place.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1470,"cache_read_input_tokens":161184,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1470,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"af064ad8-d415-449b-809b-97262f6720bc","uuid":"0d9eabf5-b56b-4fa3-abd5-60e89c795476"}
