Patterns\n    45→\n    46→### When Replay was most effective\n    47→\n    48→Replay was used for 3 failures and achieved 100% debugging success in those cases. It was most effective for:\n    49→\n    50→- **Infrastructure/browser-level issues (CAL-GRID-15):** Replay's `Logpoint` tool confirmed that `handleDrop` had 0 hits, proving Playwright's `dragTo` never fired the HTML5 drop event in the Replay browser. This would have been very difficult to diagnose from test output alone.\n    51→- **Backend state bugs (Sign In form):** `NetworkRequest` inspection revealed the second auth API call was sending `action: \"signup\"` instead of `action: \"signin\"`, immediately pinpointing a state reset bug. This pattern — comparing sequential network requests — is a strong Replay use case.\n    52→- **Timeout root-cause analysis (CAL-GRID-2):** `PlaywrightSteps` showed that 28+ individual assertions each took ~2s, exceeding the 60s timeout. This guided the fix to batch assertions via `page.evaluate`.\n    53→\n    54→**Effective tool sequences:**\n    55→1. `PlaywrightSteps` → `Logpoint` → `Screenshot` (for UI interaction failures)\n    56→2. `PlaywrightSteps` → `NetworkRequest` (for backend/API state bugs)\n    57→3. `PlaywrightSteps` alone (for timeout/performance diagnosis)\n    58→\n    59→### When Replay was NOT used and why\n    60→\n    61→- **Initial test discovery run (7 failures, knfcm0-14):** No recording available — tests were run before Replay browser was configured. The agent only identified failures and queued fix subtasks.\n    62→- **Clear error output (4 failures):** The test failure messages contained enough information to diagnose the issue directly. Examples:\n    63→  - `seed-data-mismatch`: Error showed expected \"500 Units\" vs actual \"500.00 Units\" — clearly a decimal formatting issue.\n    64→  - `RUN-HDR-10`: Regression from the quantity formatting fix was obvious from the error message.\n    65→  - `CAL-GRID-12`: Same root cause as CAL-GRID-2, already diagnosed from the same recording.\n    66→  - `Deployment test`: Failure was after page reload on pagination — simplified test to remove reload.\n    67→\n    68→### Common debugging strategies that worked\n    69→\n    70→1. **Diagnose from error output first:** 8 of 12 non-Replay failures were diagnosed directly from test error messages. This is efficient when the error message is descriptive enough.\n    71→2. **PlaywrightSteps as entry point:** All 3 Replay-assisted diagnoses started with `PlaywrightSteps` to identify which step failed and get timing information. This is a reliable first tool.\n    72→3. **Batch formatting fixes:** When the `quantity-decimal-formatting` cluster was identified, a single formatting utility fix resolved 3 related failures at once.\n    73→4. **Simplifying flaky tests:** For the deployment test, removing the page reload assertion eliminated the flakiness without losing meaningful coverage.\n    74→\n    75→### Common debugging strategies that failed\n    76→\n    77→- **No failed strategies observed in this dataset.** All debugging attempts that were made (8 out of 15 failures) succeeded. The 7 failures marked as `debugging_successful: no` were all from the initial discovery run (knfcm0-14) where no debugging was attempted — the agent only identified failures and queued them for later fixing.\n    78→\n    79→### Recurring failure categories\n    80→\n    81→| Category | Count | Notes |\n    82→|----------|-------|-------|\n    83→| other | 6 | 5 from initial AccountCard discovery run (never diagnosed in this log), 1 regression |\n    84→| seed-data-mismatch | 2 | Both from NUMERIC(15,2) returning decimal strings |\n    85→| timeout | 2 | Both from excessive per-assertion latency in calendar tests |\n    86→| backend-bug | 2 | 1 category total mismatch, 1 auth state bug |\n    87→| strict-mode | 1 | Accounting AccountCard |\n    88→| infrastructure | 1 | Playwright dragTo not firing HTML5 events in Replay browser |\n    89→\n    90→**Root cause clusters:**\n    91→- `quantity-decimal-formatting` (3 failures): PostgreSQL `NUMERIC(15,2)` columns return string values like \"500.00\" instead of integer \"500\". Affects both test assertions and UI display.\n    92→- `auth-form-state-reset` (1 failure): Auth mode state not reset when switching between sign-in and sign-up flows.\n    93→\n    94→## 4. Recommendations\n    95→\n    96→### `skills/debugging/*.md`\n    97→\n    98→- **Add pattern: \"PlaywrightSteps-first\" triage.** Document that `PlaywrightSteps` should always be the first Replay tool called when diagnosing test failures. It provides step timing, identifies which step failed, and guides which tool to use next (NetworkRequest for API issues, Logpoint for missing event handlers, Screenshot for visual state).\n    99→- **Add pattern: Network request comparison.** When a test fails on a repeated action (e.g., sign-in after sign-out), use `NetworkRequest` to compare the request payloads of the first (successful) and second (failed) attempts. State mutation bugs often manifest as incorrect payloads in subsequent requests.\n   100→- **Add category guidance for `seed-data-mismatch`.** When test assertions fail on numeric values, check whether the database column type (e.g., `NUMERIC(15,2)`) returns decimal strings. The fix is usually a formatting utility, not a test change.\n   101→\n   102→### `skills/tasks/build/testing.md`\n   103→\n   104→- **Ensure Replay browser is installed before first test run.** The Accounting app's initial test run (knfcm0-14) had 7 failures with no recordings because the Replay browser wasn't configured yet. The testing workflow should install and verify the Replay browser before running any tests, not after failures are discovered.\n   105→- **Run formatting-sensitive tests with explicit formatting assertions.** When seed data uses `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` columns, tests should expect the formatted output (e.g., \"500\" not \"500.00\") or the test writing skill should document the expected format.\n   106→\n   107→### `skills/review/reportTestFailures.md`\n   108→\n   109→- **Clarify \"debugging_successful: no\" vs \"not attempted\".** The current template doesn't distinguish between \"debugging was attempted and failed\" vs \"debugging was not attempted (discovery run only).\" Consider adding a `DEBUGGING_ATTEMPTED: yes/no` field to avoid inflating failure rates. In this report, 7 of 7 \"no\" results were actually \"not attempted.\"\n   110→- **Add `REPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON` to the failure table.** The current table template omits this field, but it's the most informative field for understanding Replay adoption gaps. Adding a truncated version to the table would make the report more scannable.\n   111→- **Consider excluding discovery-run failures from Replay usage statistics.** When tests are run purely to identify which ones fail (no debugging attempted), including those failures in the \"Replay not used\" count skews the rate downward.

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→## Running Tests\n   149→\n   150→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   151→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   152→\n   153→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   154→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   155→\n   156→## Debugging\n   157→\n   158→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   159→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   160→\n   161→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   162→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   163→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   164→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   165→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   166→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   167→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   168→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   169→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   170→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   171→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   172→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   173→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   174→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   175→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   176→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   177→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   178→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   179→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   180→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   181→   making any changes.\n   182→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   183→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   184→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   185→   on what you found.\n   186→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   187→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   188→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   189→\n   190→### Bug Writeup Template\n   191→\n   192→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   193→\n   194→```\n   195→# Bug: <test name>\n   196→\n   197→## Step 1: Evidence\n   198→\n   199→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   200→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   201→no evidence.>\n   202→\n   203→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   204→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   205→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   206→\n   207→## Step 2: Determination\n   208→\n   209→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   210→\n   211→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   212→\n   213→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   214→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   215→```\n   216→\n   217→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   218→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   219→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   220→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   221→\n   222→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   223→\n   224→## Directives\n   225→\n   226→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   227→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   228→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   229→\n   230→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   231→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   232→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   233→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   234→\n   235→- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n   236→  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n   237→  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   238→\n   239→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   240→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   241→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   242→\n   243→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   244→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   245→\n   246→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   247→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   248→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   249→\n   250→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   251→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   252→\n   253→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   254→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   255→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   256→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   257→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   258→\n   259→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   260→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   261→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   262→\n   263→## Tips\n   264→\n   265→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   266→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   267→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   268→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   269→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   270→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   271→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   272→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   273→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   274→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   275→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   276→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   277→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   278→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   279→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   280→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   281→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   282→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   283→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   284→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   285→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   286→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   287→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   288→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   289→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   290→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   291→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   292→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   293→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   294→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   295→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   296→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   297→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n   298→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   299→- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n   300→  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n   301→  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n   302→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   303→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   304→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   305→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   306→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   307→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   308→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   309→- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n   310→  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n   311→  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n   312→- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n   313→  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n   314→  cold start latency.\n   315→- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n   316→  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n   317→  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n   318→- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n","numLines":324,"startLine":1,"totalLines":324}}}

NetworkRequest revealed a 409 \"Email already in use\"\n    66→because the frontend sent `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`.\n    67→\n    68→### State hydration gap (action succeeds but UI doesn't update)\n    69→An action completes successfully (data visible in localStorage or network response) but the\n    70→UI doesn't reflect the change. The component still shows stale state because the state\n    71→management layer wasn't hydrated.\n    72→\n    73→**Diagnosis with Replay**: `PlaywrightSteps` shows the action completed. `NetworkRequest`\n    74→or `LocalStorage` confirms the data was stored correctly. `ReactRenders` / `DescribeReactRender`\n    75→shows the component didn't re-render, or rendered with stale props.\n    76→\n    77→**Debugging checklist**:\n    78→1. Redux store dispatch — was the action dispatched after the successful operation?\n    79→2. localStorage → Redux hydration — does the app load persisted state on mount/navigation?\n    80→3. Component re-render triggers — is the component subscribed to the relevant store slice?\n    81→\n    82→**Fix**: Ensure the state management layer (Redux, Context, etc.) is hydrated from persistent\n    83→storage on app startup and that successful operations dispatch the appropriate state updates.\n    84→\n    85→*Example*: Auto-login test.

ConsoleMessages or test\n    94→output shows `NeonDbError: column \"X\" does not exist`.\n    95→\n    96→**Fix**: Add `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` migration statements.\n    97→\n    98→*Example*: \"column owner_id does not exist\".

The dialog unmounts, losing the results.\n   122→\n   123→**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the import API call succeeding. SearchSources\n   124→shows the results rendering code has 0 hits (component unmounted before it could render).\n   125→\n   126→**Fix**: Delay calling `onImported()` until after results are displayed, or keep the dialog\n   127→open until the user dismisses it.\n   128→\n   129→*Example*: Import dialog test. Replay showed the API succeeded but `onImported()` closed\n   130→the dialog before results rendered.\n   131→\n   132→### Database CHECK constraint violation\n   133→A form sends a value that violates a database CHECK constraint (e.g., status `'active'` when\n   134→the column only allows `'open'`, `'won'`, `'lost'`). The API returns 500 but the error\n   135→message may not clearly indicate which value is invalid.\n   136→\n   137→**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the POST/PUT returning 500. Logpoint on the\n   138→handler reveals the exact constraint error (e.g., `new row violates check constraint`).\n   139→ReadSource on the handler confirms which values are sent.\n   140→\n   141→**Fix**: Update the form/component to send only values that match the database enum.\n   142→\n   143→*Example*: CreateDealModal sent `'on_track'` as status but DB only accepted\n   144→`'open'`/`'won'`/`'lost'`. 10 Replay tools used to trace.\n   145→\n   146→### Stale dev server with deleted Neon branch\n   147→When `reuseExistingServer` in Playwright config reuses a dev server whose `DATABASE_URL`\n   148→points to a deleted ephemeral Neon branch, all API calls fail with auth or connection errors.\n   149→\n   150→**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows no API calls or all returning errors.\n   151→LocalStorage + GetStack traces the auth token lifecycle to find where it breaks.

Check hit counts to\n   confirm the code executed.\n2. **`Logpoint`** — Place logpoints on the API response handler to see the exact data\n   returned. Then place logpoints on state update dispatches and component render functions\n   to trace how the data flowed through the app.\n3. **`NetworkRequest`** — Verify the raw API response matches what the logpoints showed.\n   Discrepancies indicate a transformation bug between fetch and state update.\n\nThis is especially useful for seed data mismatches where tests expect specific values\n(e.g., assignee names) that don't exist in the database.\n\n*Example*: \"Action menu Edit opens task edit dialog\" failed because tests expected\nfictional assignee names. SearchSources → Logpoint → NetworkRequest traced the mismatch\nfrom API response through to component rendering.\n\n## Common Root Causes (from observed failures)\n\n### Auth request payload mismatch\nAn auth-related test fails because the frontend sends the wrong action type or missing fields\nin the request payload (e.g., `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`). The backend returns\nan error like 409 Conflict or 400 Bad Request, but the test output may only show a timeout\nor generic failure.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: `PlaywrightSteps` identifies the slow or failing step.\n`NetworkRequest` reveals the exact request payload and response body — e.g., a 409 Conflict\nwith \"Email already in use\" because the request sent `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`.\nThis pinpoints the bug to UI state management (e.g., `isSignUp` not resetting on mode switch).\n\n**Fix**: Trace the action type from UI state through to the request payload and fix the state\nmanagement bug. Common causes: toggle state not resetting, form reusing stale state from a\nprevious interaction.\n\n*Example*: Sign In form test failed. NetworkRequest revealed a 409 \"Email already in use\"\nbecause the frontend sent `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`.\n\n### State hydration gap (action succeeds but UI doesn't update)\nAn action completes successfully (data visible in localStorage or network response) but the\nUI doesn't reflect the change. The component still shows stale state because the state\nmanagement layer wasn't hydrated.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: `PlaywrightSteps` shows the action completed. `NetworkRequest`\nor `LocalStorage` confirms the data was stored correctly. `ReactRenders` / `DescribeReactRender`\nshows the component didn't re-render, or rendered with stale props.\n\n**Debugging checklist**:\n1. Redux store dispatch — was the action dispatched after the successful operation?\n2. localStorage → Redux hydration — does the app load persisted state on mount/navigation?\n3. Component re-render triggers — is the component subscribed to the relevant store slice?\n\n**Fix**: Ensure the state management layer (Redux, Context, etc.) is hydrated from persistent\nstorage on app startup and that successful operations dispatch the appropriate state updates.\n\n*Example*: Auto-login test. Token was stored in localStorage but sidebar didn't update.\nFix: added `loadSession` on app startup and `setSession` Redux action dispatched from\nConfirmEmailPage.\n\n### Missing database columns (schema migration)\n`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` doesn't modify existing tables. When new columns are added to\nthe schema definition, existing ephemeral branches don't get them.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows API returning 500. ConsoleMessages or test\noutput shows `NeonDbError: column \"X\" does not exist`.\n\n**Fix**: Add `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` migration statements.\n\n*Example*: \"column owner_id does not exist\". Fixed by adding a `runMigrations` function\nwith ALTER TABLE statements.\n\n### Missing environment variables on deployment\nNetlify functions return errors because DATABASE_URL or other env vars aren't configured\non the Netlify site.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows function endpoints returning 500 or error\nJSON. ConsoleMessages shows connection/auth errors.\n\n**Fix**: Set env vars via `netlify env:set` or the Netlify dashboard.\n\n*Example*: Deployment test failed because Netlify functions lacked DATABASE_URL.\n\n### Database authentication errors\nA stale or rotated database password causes all API calls to fail with authentication errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows all data-fetching endpoints returning errors.\n\n**Fix**: Update the database connection string with the current password.\n\n### Import dialog closing before results display\nA component calls `onImported()` (which closes a dialog) before the import results are\navailable to display. The dialog unmounts, losing the results.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the import API call succeeding. SearchSources\nshows the results rendering code has 0 hits (component unmounted before it could render).\n\n**Fix**: Delay calling `onImported()` until after results are displayed, or keep the dialog\nopen until the user dismisses it.\n\n*Example*: Import dialog test. Replay showed the API succeeded but `onImported()` closed\nthe dialog before results rendered.\n\n### Database CHECK constraint violation\nA form sends a value that violates a database CHECK constraint (e.g., status `'active'` when\nthe column only allows `'open'`, `'won'`, `'lost'`). The API returns 500 but the error\nmessage may not clearly indicate which value is invalid.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the POST/PUT returning 500. Logpoint on the\nhandler reveals the exact constraint error (e.g., `new row violates check constraint`).\nReadSource on the handler confirms which values are sent.\n\n**Fix**: Update the form/component to send only values that match the database enum.\n\n*Example*: CreateDealModal sent `'on_track'` as status but DB only accepted\n`'open'`/`'won'`/`'lost'`. 10 Replay tools used to trace.\n\n### Stale dev server with deleted Neon branch\nWhen `reuseExistingServer` in Playwright config reuses a dev server whose `DATABASE_URL`\npoints to a deleted ephemeral Neon branch, all API calls fail with auth or connection errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows no API calls or all returning errors.\nLocalStorage + GetStack traces the auth token lifecycle to find where it breaks. The\nrecording shows the frontend working but all data requests failing.\n\n**Fix**: Kill the stale dev server and let Playwright start a fresh one with the correct\n`DATABASE_URL`. Set `reuseExistingServer: false` or add cleanup logic.\n\n*Example*: 8 Replay tools traced from \"no API calls\" → \"auth token removed\" → \"JWT ok\nbut DB query fails on deleted branch\".\n","numLines":159,"startLine":1,"totalLines":159}}}

Let me apply the recommendations:\n\n### Recommendations for `skills/debugging/*.md`:\n\n1. **Add pattern: \"PlaywrightSteps-first\" triage.** - The README.md already has a \"Default First-Line Sequence: PlaywrightSteps → Screenshot\" section. The recommendation is to document that PlaywrightSteps should always be the first Replay tool called. The README already says this somewhat, but I should strengthen it with the specific guidance about what to do next based on PlaywrightSteps results.\n\n2. **Add pattern: Network request comparison.** - This should go in `network-and-api.md`. It's about comparing request payloads of first (successful) and second (failed) attempts when a test fails on a repeated action.\n\n\n3. **Add category guidance for `seed-data-mismatch`.** - This should go in `seed-data.md`. When test assertions fail on numeric values, I need to check whether the database column type (e.g., `NUMERIC(15,2)`) returns decimal strings.\n\n### Recommendations for `skills/tasks/build/testing.md`:\n\n1. **Ensure Replay browser is installed before first test run.** - Need to add guidance about verifying Replay browser installation before running tests.\n\n2. **Run formatting-sensitive tests with explicit formatting assertions.** - Add guidance about NUMERIC/DECIMAL column formatting.\n\n### Recommendations for `skills/review/reportTestFail`...\n\nFor the failure reporting documentation, I should clarify the distinction between cases where debugging wasn't successful versus where it wasn't attempted, add a field to track the reason Replay wasn't used when applicable, and separate out discovery-run failures from the overall Replay usage metrics to get a more accurate picture of debugging effectiveness.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4940,"cache_read_input_tokens":36212,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4940,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bda82fd5-3daf-4cc3-b578-4b1c64052943","uuid":"ac7f42fe-41b1-4878-8413-02ae7f479605"}

Check:\n   - Did the expected API call happen?\n   - What status code was returned?\n   - What was the response body?\n   - Were there unexpected duplicate requests?\n\n2. **`ConsoleMessages`** — Check for logged errors from failed fetch calls.\n\n3. **`Logpoint`** — Place logpoints on API handler code (Netlify functions) or frontend\n   fetch calls to inspect request/response data at runtime. Useful for seeing:\n   - What parameters were sent to the API\n   - What the database query returned\n   - How the response was transformed before reaching the UI\n\n4. **`SearchSources`** — Check hit counts on API handler lines. If a handler was called\n   0 times, the request never reached it (routing issue). If called more times than expected,\n   something is triggering duplicate requests.\n\n5. **`ReadSource`** — Read the actual source code of API handlers to verify the logic.\n\n## Data-Flow Tracing with Logpoint + SearchSources\n\nWhen the UI renders but displays wrong values (wrong names, incorrect counts, stale data),\nuse this sequence to trace data from API response through state management to component props:\n\n1. **`SearchSources`** — Search for the API handler or fetch call. Check hit counts to\n   confirm the code executed.\n2. **`Logpoint`** — Place logpoints on the API response handler to see the exact data\n   returned. Then place logpoints on state update dispatches and component render functions\n   to trace how the data flowed through the app.\n3. **`NetworkRequest`** — Verify the raw API response matches what the logpoints showed.\n   Discrepancies indicate a transformation bug between fetch and state update.\n\nThis is especially useful for seed data mismatches where tests expect specific values\n(e.g., assignee names) that don't exist in the database.\n\n*Example*: \"Action menu Edit opens task edit dialog\" failed because tests expected\nfictional assignee names. SearchSources → Logpoint → NetworkRequest traced the mismatch\nfrom API response through to component rendering.\n\n## Common Root Causes (from observed failures)\n\n### Auth request payload mismatch\nAn auth-related test fails because the frontend sends the wrong action type or missing fields\nin the request payload (e.g., `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`). The backend returns\nan error like 409 Conflict or 400 Bad Request, but the test output may only show a timeout\nor generic failure.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: `PlaywrightSteps` identifies the slow or failing step.\n`NetworkRequest` reveals the exact request payload and response body — e.g., a 409 Conflict\nwith \"Email already in use\" because the request sent `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`.\nThis pinpoints the bug to UI state management (e.g., `isSignUp` not resetting on mode switch).\n\n**Fix**: Trace the action type from UI state through to the request payload and fix the state\nmanagement bug. Common causes: toggle state not resetting, form reusing stale state from a\nprevious interaction.\n\n*Example*: Sign In form test failed. NetworkRequest revealed a 409 \"Email already in use\"\nbecause the frontend sent `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`.\n\n### State hydration gap (action succeeds but UI doesn't update)\nAn action completes successfully (data visible in localStorage or network response) but the\nUI doesn't reflect the change. The component still shows stale state because the state\nmanagement layer wasn't hydrated.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: `PlaywrightSteps` shows the action completed. `NetworkRequest`\nor `LocalStorage` confirms the data was stored correctly. `ReactRenders` / `DescribeReactRender`\nshows the component didn't re-render, or rendered with stale props.\n\n**Debugging checklist**:\n1. Redux store dispatch — was the action dispatched after the successful operation?\n2. localStorage → Redux hydration — does the app load persisted state on mount/navigation?\n3. Component re-render triggers — is the component subscribed to the relevant store slice?\n\n**Fix**: Ensure the state management layer (Redux, Context, etc.) is hydrated from persistent\nstorage on app startup and that successful operations dispatch the appropriate state updates.\n\n*Example*: Auto-login test. Token was stored in localStorage but sidebar didn't update.\nFix: added `loadSession` on app startup and `setSession` Redux action dispatched from\nConfirmEmailPage.\n\n### Missing database columns (schema migration)\n`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` doesn't modify existing tables. When new columns are added to\nthe schema definition, existing ephemeral branches don't get them.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows API returning 500. ConsoleMessages or test\noutput shows `NeonDbError: column \"X\" does not exist`.\n\n**Fix**: Add `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` migration statements.\n\n*Example*: \"column owner_id does not exist\". Fixed by adding a `runMigrations` function\nwith ALTER TABLE statements.\n\n### Missing environment variables on deployment\nNetlify functions return errors because DATABASE_URL or other env vars aren't configured\non the Netlify site.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows function endpoints returning 500 or error\nJSON. ConsoleMessages shows connection/auth errors.\n\n**Fix**: Set env vars via `netlify env:set` or the Netlify dashboard.\n\n*Example*: Deployment test failed because Netlify functions lacked DATABASE_URL.\n\n### Database authentication errors\nA stale or rotated database password causes all API calls to fail with authentication errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows all data-fetching endpoints returning errors.\n\n**Fix**: Update the database connection string with the current password.\n\n### Import dialog closing before results display\nA component calls `onImported()` (which closes a dialog) before the import results are\navailable to display. The dialog unmounts, losing the results.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the import API call succeeding. SearchSources\nshows the results rendering code has 0 hits (component unmounted before it could render).\n\n**Fix**: Delay calling `onImported()` until after results are displayed, or keep the dialog\nopen until the user dismisses it.\n\n*Example*: Import dialog test. Replay showed the API succeeded but `onImported()` closed\nthe dialog before results rendered.\n\n### Database CHECK constraint violation\nA form sends a value that violates a database CHECK constraint (e.g., status `'active'` when\nthe column only allows `'open'`, `'won'`, `'lost'`). The API returns 500 but the error\nmessage may not clearly indicate which value is invalid.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows the POST/PUT returning 500. Logpoint on the\nhandler reveals the exact constraint error (e.g., `new row violates check constraint`).\nReadSource on the handler confirms which values are sent.\n\n**Fix**: Update the form/component to send only values that match the database enum.\n\n*Example*: CreateDealModal sent `'on_track'` as status but DB only accepted\n`'open'`/`'won'`/`'lost'`. 10 Replay tools used to trace.\n\n### Stale dev server with deleted Neon branch\nWhen `reuseExistingServer` in Playwright config reuses a dev server whose `DATABASE_URL`\npoints to a deleted ephemeral Neon branch, all API calls fail with auth or connection errors.\n\n**Diagnosis with Replay**: NetworkRequest shows no API calls or all returning errors.\nLocalStorage + GetStack traces the auth token lifecycle to find where it breaks. The\nrecording shows the frontend working but all data requests failing.\n\n**Fix**: Kill the stale dev server and let Playwright start a fresh one with the correct\n`DATABASE_URL`. Set `reuseExistingServer: false` or add cleanup logic.\n\n*Example*: 8 Replay tools traced from \"no API calls\" → \"auth token removed\" → \"JWT ok\nbut DB query fails on deleted branch\".\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":45,"oldLines":6,"newStart":45,"newLines":20,"lines":[" fictional assignee names.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":145,"oldLines":6,"newStart":145,"newLines":18,"lines":[" `libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (skill updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL,\n  etc.) are set on the deployment target (e.g., Netlify). Missing env vars cause infrastructure\n  failures that waste a full test cycle. Use `netlify env:list` to check.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n- Tests that run in `fullyParallel` mode must use unique test data per worker. Tests that share\n  mutable state (same client IDs, same task names) will cause cross-test data contamination.\n  Use unique identifiers (e.g., worker-specific prefixes) or run stateful tests serially.\n- The Vite dev server cold start can cause the first test in a suite to timeout. Consider adding\n  a warm-up navigation in `beforeAll` or increasing the first test's timeout to account for\n  cold start latency.\n- Avoid hardcoding expected values in assertions. Tests that hardcode specific counts (e.g.,\n  `expect 1 remaining task`) or specific names (e.g., `\"David Lee\"`) break when test data\n  changes. Use relative assertions or query actual seed data to derive expected values.\n- Validate that seed data exists before asserting on it. If a test expects a specific assignee\n  name or record count, verify the data is present first. This catches seed data mismatches\n  early instead of producing confusing assertion failures.\n- Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in\n  the component source. Missing `data-testid` attributes cause test failures that are easy to\n  prevent with a quick source check.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":333,"oldLines":3,"newStart":333,"newLines":7,"lines":[" - Before writing tests that rely on `data-testid` attributes, verify those attributes exist in","   the component source.
