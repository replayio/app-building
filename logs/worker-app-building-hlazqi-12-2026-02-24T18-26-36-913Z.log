Multiple test runs with iterative fixes. Fixed Replay browser config, timeout issues, OpenSSL compatibility, and a real app bug in SidebarUserArea (isSignUp state not being reset). Final result: all 18 tests passing after 8 test runs.\n\n## Test Failures\nTEST_FAILURES: 8\n\n### Failure: Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: no\nREPLAY_USED: yes\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes\n\n#### Replay Usage\nOUTCOME: Discovered that SettingsPage rendered at 25.7s — nearly at the 30s timeout. The Replay browser's overhead caused slow page loads when all tests hit the dev server simultaneously.\nDEBUGGING_STRATEGY: PlaywrightSteps to find stuck step, then Screenshot and InspectElement to verify elements existed in DOM, DescribeComponent to check render timing\nTOOLS_USED: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__ReactComponents, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__InspectElement, mcp__replay__DescribeComponent, mcp__replay__DescribePoint\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons\n\n### Failure: Clicking Clients link navigates to /clients\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: no\nREPLAY_USED: yes\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes\n\n#### Replay Usage\nOUTCOME: Same root cause as above — Replay browser slowness. The test navigated to /settings but the settings-page testid wasn't visible within the timeout. Screenshots showed the page eventually loaded.\nDEBUGGING_STRATEGY: Same investigation as \"Sidebar displays all navigation links\" — the recording was used for all 6 nav failures\nTOOLS_USED: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__ReactComponents, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__InspectElement, mcp__replay__DescribeComponent, mcp__replay__DescribePoint\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: Clicking Clients link navigates to /clients\n\n### Failure: Clicking Contacts link navigates to /contacts\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: no\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from same root cause as Clients link failure — all 6 nav failures shared the same timeout issue\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: Clicking Contacts link navigates to /contacts\n\n### Failure: Clicking Deals link navigates to /deals\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: no\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from same root cause as Clients link failure\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: Clicking Deals link navigates to /deals\n\n### Failure: Clicking Tasks link navigates to /tasks\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: no\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from same root cause as Clients link failure\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: Clicking Tasks link navigates to /tasks\n\n### Failure: Clicking Team link navigates to /users\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: no\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from same root cause as Clients link failure\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: Clicking Team link navigates to /users\n\n### Failure: Sign In form submits with email and password\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: backend-bug\nPRE_EXISTING: no\nREPLAY_USED: yes\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes\n\n#### Replay Usage\nOUTCOME: Discovered two issues: (1) beforeEach wasted ~36s on unnecessary localStorage cleanup + reload; (2) after signup→signout→signin flow, the auth POST sent action \"signup\" instead of \"signin\" returning 409 Conflict. Root cause was SidebarUserArea not resetting isSignUp state when \"Sign In\" button was clicked.\nDEBUGGING_STRATEGY: PlaywrightSteps to identify slow steps, NetworkRequest to inspect auth API responses (found 409 Conflict with \"Email already in use\"), ReactRenders and DescribeReactRender to check component re-render timing, Screenshot to verify visual state\nTOOLS_USED: mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps, mcp__replay__NetworkRequest, mcp__replay__ReactRenders, mcp__replay__DescribeReactRender, mcp__replay__Screenshot, mcp__replay__InspectElement\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: Sign In form submits with email and password\n\n### Failure: Logged in state shows avatar, name, and sign-out\nFAILURE_CATEGORY: timeout\nPRE_EXISTING: no\nREPLAY_USED: no\nREPLAY_NOT_USED_REASON: diagnosed from error output — same timeout pattern as other auth tests; fixed by increasing assertion timeouts\nRECORDING_AVAILABLE: yes\nDEBUGGING_SUCCESSFUL: yes\n\n#### Resolution\nCHANGESET_REVISION: none\nFAILING_TEST: Logged in state shows avatar, name, and sign-out\n\n# worker-2026-02-23T23-21-54-548Z.log\n\n## Summary\nNOTES: Unpacking deployment job into DoDeploy and TestDeploy sub-groups.

Let me compile the statistics and create the synthesis report.\n\nLet me go through and extract all the test failures:\n\n**Logs with test failures:**\n\n1. **worker-2026-02-23T23-21-34-717Z.log** - TEST_FAILURES: 8\n   - Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons - timeout, not pre-existing, Replay used, recording available, debugging successful\n   - Clicking Clients link navigates to /clients - timeout, not pre-existing, Replay used, recording available, debugging successful\n   - Clicking Contacts link navigates to /contacts - timeout, not pre-existing, Replay NOT used (same root cause), recording available, debugging successful\n   - Clicking Deals, Tasks, and Team links all show similar timeout patterns with Replay not used due to shared root causes, though recordings and debugging were successful\n   - Sign In form submission failed due to a backend bug rather than a timeout, with Replay used for debugging\n   - The logged-in state test also timed out, with the root cause identified from error output without needing Replay\n   - Looking at the remaining logs, I see one infrastructure issue preventing a deployment test from running with no recording available, and one pre-existing backend bug in the auto-login flow that was successfully debugged with Replay\n   - Across all 88 logs analyzed, only 3 contained test failures, with 10 distinct issues identified total\n   - Of those 10 failures, 4 were debugged using Replay (40% usage rate), and 9 of the 10 were non-pre-existing issues that all resolved successfully through debugging (100% success rate)\n   - When Replay was used, it had a perfect track record—all 4 cases where it was deployed resulted in successful debugging\n   - Recordings were available for 9 out of 10 failures (90% availability), with the deployment test being the only one without a recording\n   - Looking at the test re-runs, the logs indicate it took 8 total test runs to get all 18 tests passing, meaning 7 re-runs after the initial run\n\n; the deployment test needed 1 re-run, and the email confirmation test required 2 re-runs to achieve all-pass status\n\n. That brings the total to 10 re-runs across these three logs. Now I'm checking the other logs to see if any mention test runs without failures — the sidebar auth tests all passed on the first run, and I'm looking at what the next log shows.\n\nLooking at the remaining logs, they all show tests passing without any re-runs needed. So my total count stays at 10 re-runs across all the logs.\n\nNow I'm organizing the failures by category — timeouts account for 7 of them across sidebar navigation and logged-in state tests, while

Patterns\n\n### When Replay was most effective\n\n- **Backend-bug diagnosis:** Replay was decisive for the Sign In form failure. NetworkRequest revealed a 409 Conflict response with \"Email already in use\", pinpointing that the frontend sent `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`. Without Replay, this would have required significant trial-and-error debugging since the error was in request payload construction, not obvious from test output.\n\n- **State management bugs:** For the Auto-login confirmation failure, PlaywrightSteps showed the token was correctly stored in localStorage but the sidebar didn't update, revealing the Redux store wasn't being hydrated from localStorage on navigation. This led to the fix of adding a `loadSession` call on app startup and a `setSession` Redux action.\n\n- **Render timing analysis:** For timeout failures, DescribeComponent showed that SettingsPage rendered at 25.7s — close to the 30s timeout — confirming Replay browser overhead as the root cause rather than a code bug.\n\n- **Most effective tool sequences:**\n  1. `PlaywrightSteps` → `NetworkRequest` — for API-related failures (identified malformed request payloads)\n  2. `PlaywrightSteps` → `Screenshot` → `DescribeComponent` — for timeout failures (confirmed elements existed but loaded slowly)\n  3. `PlaywrightSteps` alone — sufficient for state management bugs when the execution flow revealed the gap\n\n### When Replay was NOT used and why\n\n- **Batch diagnosis from shared root cause (4 failures):** Once the first two timeout failures were diagnosed via Replay as Replay browser overhead, the remaining 4 navigation link failures were immediately attributed to the same cause without needing individual Replay analysis. This was efficient and correct.\n\n- **Diagnosed from error output (2 failures):** The \"Logged in state\" timeout and the deployment infrastructure failure were both diagnosable from Playwright's error messages alone. The deployment failure showed \"Network error\" which directly pointed to a missing environment variable.\n\n### Common debugging strategies that worked\n\n1. **Increase timeouts for Replay browser:** 7 of 10 failures were timeouts caused by Replay browser overhead. The fix was increasing `actionTimeout`, `navigationTimeout`, and assertion timeouts in playwright.config.ts. This is an expected pattern when using Replay Chromium.\n\n2. **Trace state through the full pipeline:** For the auth bug, following the data from UI action → request payload → backend response → error revealed the exact point of failure (isSignUp state not being reset).\n\n3. **Fix infrastructure before debugging code:** The deployment failure was correctly identified as a missing env var rather than a code bug, avoiding wasted debugging effort.\n\n### Common debugging strategies that failed\n\n- No debugging strategies explicitly failed in this build cycle. All 10 failures were resolved successfully. However, the auto-login fix required 3 test runs because the first fix attempt (only adding `loadSession` to App.tsx) was incomplete — the agent needed to also add the `setSession` Redux action and dispatch it from ConfirmEmailPage.\n\n### Recurring failure categories\n\n- **Timeout (70%):** Dominated by Replay browser overhead. All 7 timeout failures had the same root cause — insufficient timeouts for the Replay Chromium browser which adds instrumentation overhead. This is a systemic issue that could be prevented by setting higher default timeouts in test configuration from the start.\n\n- **Backend-bug (20%):** Both backend bugs involved auth state management — one was a UI state (`isSignUp`) not being reset on mode switch, the other was Redux store not being hydrated from localStorage. Both point to state synchronization gaps in the auth flow.\n\n- **Infrastructure (10%):** Single deployment failure from a missing DATABASE_URL environment variable on Netlify.\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\n### `skills/debugging/*.md`\n\n- **Add \"Replay browser timeout\" as a known pattern:** When multiple tests fail with timeouts in the first test run, and the app is a fresh build, the most likely cause is insufficient timeouts for Replay Chromium. Recommended fix: increase `actionTimeout` to 15s+, `navigationTimeout` to 30s+, and use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions.\n\n- **Add \"NetworkRequest for auth debugging\" pattern:** When auth-related tests fail, use `PlaywrightSteps` → `NetworkRequest` to inspect the exact request payloads and response bodies. Auth bugs frequently involve mismatched action types or missing fields in request bodies.\n\n- **Add \"State hydration\" debugging checklist:** For failures where an action succeeds (data in localStorage/network) but UI doesn't update, check: (1) Redux store dispatch, (2) localStorage → Redux hydration on mount, (3) component re-render triggers.\n\n### `skills/tasks/build/testing.md`\n\n- **Set Replay-aware timeouts from the start:** The playwright.config.ts template should include `actionTimeout: 15000`, `navigationTimeout: 30000`, and a note about Replay browser overhead. This would have prevented 7 of 10 failures (70%).\n\n- **Include `--functions` flag in webServer command:** Ensure the Playwright webServer command always includes `--functions ./netlify/functions` when using Netlify Functions to avoid function resolution failures.\n\n- **Pre-validate deployment environment variables:** Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL, etc.) are set on the deployment target. This prevents infrastructure failures that waste a test cycle.\n\n### `skills/review/reportTestFailures.md`\n\n- **Add \"Test Re-runs per Log\" to per-log analysis template:** The current template captures failure count but not how many test runs were needed to achieve all-pass. Adding a `TEST_RERUNS: <count>` field would make re-run statistics more precise in the synthesis.\n\n- **Add \"Root Cause Cluster\" field:** When multiple failures share a single root cause (like the 7 timeout failures here), a cluster field would reduce redundancy in the failure table and make patterns more visible.

Patterns\n\n### When Replay was most effective\n\n- **Backend-bug diagnosis:** Replay was decisive for the Sign In form failure. NetworkRequest revealed a 409 Conflict response with \"Email already in use\", pinpointing that the frontend sent `action: \"signup\"` instead of `\"signin\"`. Without Replay, this would have required significant trial-and-error debugging since the error was in request payload construction, not obvious from test output.\n\n- **State management bugs:** For the Auto-login confirmation failure, PlaywrightSteps showed the token was correctly stored in localStorage but the sidebar didn't update, revealing the Redux store wasn't being hydrated from localStorage on navigation. This led to the fix of adding a `loadSession` call on app startup and a `setSession` Redux action.\n\n- **Render timing analysis:** For timeout failures, DescribeComponent showed that SettingsPage rendered at 25.7s — close to the 30s timeout — confirming Replay browser overhead as the root cause rather than a code bug.\n\n- **Most effective tool sequences:**\n  1. `PlaywrightSteps` → `NetworkRequest` — for API-related failures (identified malformed request payloads)\n  2. `PlaywrightSteps` → `Screenshot` → `DescribeComponent` — for timeout failures (confirmed elements existed but loaded slowly)\n  3. `PlaywrightSteps` alone — sufficient for state management bugs when the execution flow revealed the gap\n\n### When Replay was NOT used and why\n\n- **Batch diagnosis from shared root cause (4 failures):** Once the first two timeout failures were diagnosed via Replay as Replay browser overhead, the remaining 4 navigation link failures were immediately attributed to the same cause without needing individual Replay analysis. This was efficient and correct.\n\n- **Diagnosed from error output (2 failures):** The \"Logged in state\" timeout and the deployment infrastructure failure were both diagnosable from Playwright's error messages alone. The deployment failure showed \"Network error\" which directly pointed to a missing environment variable.\n\n### Common debugging strategies that worked\n\n1. **Increase timeouts for Replay browser:** 7 of 10 failures were timeouts caused by Replay browser overhead. The fix was increasing `actionTimeout`, `navigationTimeout`, and assertion timeouts in playwright.config.ts. This is an expected pattern when using Replay Chromium.\n\n2. **Trace state through the full pipeline:** For the auth bug, following the data from UI action → request payload → backend response → error revealed the exact point of failure (isSignUp state not being reset).\n\n3. **Fix infrastructure before debugging code:** The deployment failure was correctly identified as a missing env var rather than a code bug, avoiding wasted debugging effort.\n\n### Common debugging strategies that failed\n\n- No debugging strategies explicitly failed in this build cycle. All 10 failures were resolved successfully. However, the auto-login fix required 3 test runs because the first fix attempt (only adding `loadSession` to App.tsx) was incomplete — the agent needed to also add the `setSession` Redux action and dispatch it from ConfirmEmailPage.\n\n### Recurring failure categories\n\n- **Timeout (70%):** Dominated by Replay browser overhead. All 7 timeout failures had the same root cause — insufficient timeouts for the Replay Chromium browser which adds instrumentation overhead. This is a systemic issue that could be prevented by setting higher default timeouts in test configuration from the start.\n\n- **Backend-bug (20%):** Both backend bugs involved auth state management — one was a UI state (`isSignUp`) not being reset on mode switch, the other was Redux store not being hydrated from localStorage. Both point to state synchronization gaps in the auth flow.\n\n- **Infrastructure (10%):** Single deployment failure from a missing DATABASE_URL environment variable on Netlify.\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\n### `skills/debugging/*.md`\n\n- **Add \"Replay browser timeout\" as a known pattern:** When multiple tests fail with timeouts in the first test run, and the app is a fresh build, the most likely cause is insufficient timeouts for Replay Chromium. Recommended fix: increase `actionTimeout` to 15s+, `navigationTimeout` to 30s+, and use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions.\n\n- **Add \"NetworkRequest for auth debugging\" pattern:** When auth-related tests fail, use `PlaywrightSteps` → `NetworkRequest` to inspect the exact request payloads and response bodies. Auth bugs frequently involve mismatched action types or missing fields in request bodies.\n\n- **Add \"State hydration\" debugging checklist:** For failures where an action succeeds (data in localStorage/network) but UI doesn't update, check: (1) Redux store dispatch, (2) localStorage → Redux hydration on mount, (3) component re-render triggers.\n\n### `skills/tasks/build/testing.md`\n\n- **Set Replay-aware timeouts from the start:** The playwright.config.ts template should include `actionTimeout: 15000`, `navigationTimeout: 30000`, and a note about Replay browser overhead. This would have prevented 7 of 10 failures (70%).\n\n- **Include `--functions` flag in webServer command:** Ensure the Playwright webServer command always includes `--functions ./netlify/functions` when using Netlify Functions to avoid function resolution failures.\n\n- **Pre-validate deployment environment variables:** Before running deployment tests, verify that required environment variables (DATABASE_URL, etc.) are set on the deployment target. This prevents infrastructure failures that waste a test cycle.\n\n### `skills/review/reportTestFailures.md`\n\n- **Add \"Test Re-runs per Log\" to per-log analysis template:** The current template captures failure count but not how many test runs were needed to achieve all-pass. Adding a `TEST_RERUNS: <count>` field would make re-run statistics more precise in the synthesis.\n\n- **Add \"Root Cause Cluster\" field:** When multiple failures share a single root cause (like the 7 timeout failures here), a cluster field would reduce redundancy in the failure table and make patterns more visible. Example: `ROOT_CAUSE_CLUSTER: replay-browser-timeout` applied to all 7 timeout failures.\n\n- **Clarify \"Changeset\" field semantics:** All 10 failures had `CHANGESET_REVISION: none` despite fixes being applied. The field description references a \"CHANGESET REVISION:\" line in the log, but fixes applied during the same test-fixing session don't produce separate changesets. Consider whether this field should capture the commit that fixed the issue instead.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
