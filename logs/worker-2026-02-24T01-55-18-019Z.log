Add testids during initial component development,\n    57→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    64→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    65→\n    66→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    67→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    68→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    69→\n    70→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    71→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    72→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    73→\n    74→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    75→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    76→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    77→\n    78→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    79→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    80→\n    81→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    82→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    83→  to the same destination.\n    84→\n    85→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    86→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    87→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b5f2a808-bbfb-43a3-84e4-87075a0956df","uuid":"296b3263-2438-4f1f-9f12-47758c0e0fc6","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n","numLines":138,"startLine":1,"totalLines":138}}}

The key directives for backend:\n\n\n- Tagged template literals for neon queries using `sql\\`...\\`` syntax, never the function call syntax\n- Empty strings should convert to null using `||` not `??` for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID fields\n- Resource IDs come from path index 3 after the function name at index 2\n- No TODOs, placeholders, or mock data allowed\n- The initSchema function should be the single source of truth for the database schema\n- All database operations need to stay in the backend Netlify functions, so I'm reviewing the four backend function files to ensure they follow this pattern","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1848,"cache_read_input_tokens":56125,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1848,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b5f2a808-bbfb-43a3-84e4-87075a0956df","uuid":"55612c1c-3daf-45c9-be27-7b85da940f62"}

Let me systematically check each one against the writeApp.md directives:\n\n## Directives relevant to backend functions:\n\n1. **Tagged template literal syntax for neon** (`@neondatabase/serverless`): ONLY use tagged template literal syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n\n2. **Empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID**: Always convert empty strings to null before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`.\n\n3. **Path index for resource IDs**: Resource ID at path index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments). Common off-by-one error: using index 2.\n\n\n4. **Clean code**: No TODOs, placeholder implementations, or mock data.\n5. **initSchema function**: Must accept a database URL string and return a Promise. Must NOT read `DATABASE_URL` from the environment.\n6. **All database accesses in backend Netlify functions** (from AGENTS.md).\n\nNow I'm going through each function to verify compliance. Starting with tasks.ts: the neon client is properly initialized with the database URL, the resource ID extraction uses the correct index 3, and all queries throughout the file use the tagged template literal syntax correctly.\n\nChecking the null handling across all the query parameters—dueDate conversions, client IDs, deal IDs, and assignee IDs all properly use the `||` operator or conditional checks to ensure null values are passed when needed, maintaining consistency with the database schema requirements. Checking users.ts and auth.ts files now. Both are using the correct neon setup and tagged template syntax for queries, with no coalescing operators on date fields or leftover TODOs. The auth.ts handler has an unused context parameter, but that's expected for Netlify Functions signatures.\n\nLooking at schema.ts, the initialization function properly accepts the database URL as a parameter rather than reading from environment, uses safe CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS statements, and includes all necessary migrations.\n\nNow I'm noticing some backend API files are missing entirely—clients and deals endpoints that the frontend is trying to reference don't exist yet, which could cause integration issues. I'm noticing some style inconsistencies in `auth.ts` — it's using `process.env.JWT_SECRET` and `new Response(JSON.stringify(...))` instead of `Response.json(...)` — but these aren't directive violations. Let me carefully review the actual directives to see what I should be checking for. The tagged template literal syntax for database queries looks good across all functions, and I need to verify the null conversion handling for DATE, TIMESTAMP, and UUID columns.\n\nChecking the insert and update operations in `tasks.ts` — the single create, import, and update endpoints all properly use the `||` operator to convert empty strings to null for `due_date`, `client_id`, `deal_id`, and `assignee_id` fields.\n\nMoving to `individuals.ts` — the create and update operations don't have any DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID columns, so they're safe.\n\nNow checking `users.ts`...\n\nIn `auth.ts`, the user insert relies on defaults for date and UUID fields, which is fine. The email tokens table uses a SQL expression to set the expiration time, which is also correct.\n\nI'm verifying the Netlify function path parsing — the resource ID should be at index 3 after splitting the path, not index 2 where the function name lives. Looking at `tasks.ts` and `individuals.ts`, both correctly extract the resource ID from index 3.\n\nNow checking for TODOs and placeholder code across all files. I don't see any actual TODOs, though `schema.ts` has some commented example code in a migration function, but that's just documentation rather than a blocker.\n\nThe `initSchema` function is properly exported from `schema.ts`, accepts a database URL parameter, returns a Promise, and uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements without reading from environment variables.\n\nThe remaining requirements about async callbacks returning Promises and delete button UI are frontend concerns, so they're not applicable to this backend validation.\n\nAfter reviewing all four backend functions and the schema file, I'm not finding any directive violations—the code uses tagged template literals for queries, handles DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID conversions with `|| null`, correctly indexes resource IDs at position 3, and has no TODOs or mock data. The `context` parameter in `auth.ts` isn't being used, but that's a TypeScript linting issue rather than a writeApp.md directive violation. I'm checking whether `initSchema` and `runMigrations` are both being called in the deployment and test contexts, and I notice the frontend is referencing `clients` and `deals` endpoints that don't have corresponding backend functions—that's a notable gap, though not strictly a directive violation.\n\nLooking at the core backend directives, the existing functions are handling tagged template literals, null conversions, path-based resource IDs, and schema initialization correctly. But I'm also noticing that tests.md references endpoints like `notification-preferences` and `webhooks` that don't seem to have corresponding function files, which suggests there might be missing backend implementations beyond just the `clients` and `deals` functions. I'm also noticing the webhooks schema is missing a `platform` column that the tests reference, but that's more of a schema validation issue that would surface during component checks rather than a directive violation in the backend functions themselves.

The Playwright config's `webServer` command is:\n```\nnpx netlify dev --port 8888\n```\n\nBut the directive says:\n> IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions` explicitly.\n\nThe `webServer.command` should be:\n```\nnpx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions\n```\n\nWait, but the job is \"Check writeApp.md directive violations in all backend functions\". This is about the Playwright config, not the backend functions themselves. \n\nActually, this is a backend-related directive since it directly affects how backend functions are resolved and served during testing. The Playwright config at line 25 is missing the `--functions ./netlify/functions` flag that the directive explicitly requires.\n\nEven though the netlify.toml has `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"` set, the directive warns that this alone isn't sufficient—the flag needs to be added explicitly to the Playwright command. I should flag this as an issue and also check for `sql(` function calls across all backend files to be thorough.\n\nScanning through the backend files, all SQL queries consistently use the tagged template literal syntax, so there are no violations there. I'm also checking for `??` null coalescing operators in the backend code and finding none so far.\n\nLooking at `auth.ts` specifically, I notice it has an unused `context` parameter in the handler function, though the other files use `_context` to indicate it's intentionally unused—this is more of a TypeScript linting issue than a writeApp.md violation.\n\nThe one potential issue I'm seeing is that the Playwright config doesn't include the `--functions ./netlify/functions` flag in the webServer command as the directive requires. Though technically that's a configuration concern rather than a backend function violation itself.\n\nLet me systematically verify I haven't missed anything by checking all four backend functions one more time for any actual directive violations.\n\nAfter reviewing tasks.ts, individuals.ts, users.ts, auth.ts, and schema.ts, I'm finding zero violations of the writeApp.md directives. Every backend function properly uses tagged template literals for queries, converts empty strings to null for the appropriate column types, uses the correct path index for resource IDs, and avoids TODOs or mock implementations. The initSchema function also correctly accepts a database URL parameter and returns a Promise rather than reading from environment variables.\n\nThe Playwright configuration missing the `--functions` flag is worth reconsidering, but it's not actually a backend function file itself, so it falls outside the scope of this checking job. I'm checking whether the Playwright config's missing `--functions ./netlify/functions` flag actually violates the directive, but the netlify.toml already specifies the functions directory, so `npx netlify dev` should resolve them correctly without the explicit flag. I'm noticing the `context` parameter in auth.ts isn't prefixed with an underscore, which could trigger a no-unused-vars lint rule, but that's separate from the writeApp.md directives. So my final finding is one violation: the Playwright config is missing the explicit `--functions ./netlify/functions` flag in the webServer command, which the directive requires.
