You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

Let me analyze the AccountDetailPage and its components to understand what responsive changes are needed:\n\n**AccountDetailPage.tsx** (the page itself):\n- Already has `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on the outer wrapper - GOOD\n- Uses `marginTop: 24` inline style for the materials section spacer\n\n**AccountHeader.tsx**:\n- Already has `max-sm:hidden` on button labels - GOOD\n- Uses `page-header` class which has responsive flex-wrap at 640px - GOOD\n- The metadata row uses inline styles (display: flex, gap: 16, marginTop: 8) - this could benefit from wrapping on narrow viewports\n\n\n- Page title scales down to 20px at 640px - GOOD\n\n**TrackedMaterialsTable.tsx**:\n- Already has `max-lg:hidden` on Category column - GOOD\n- Already has `max-md:hidden` on Unit of Measure and Number of Batches columns - GOOD\n- Already has `max-sm:hidden` on the \"View Material in this Account\" button text - GOOD\n- The table uses `.data-table` which already has 480px card mode - GOOD\n\n**EditAccountModal.tsx**:\n- Uses `modal-content` class which already has responsive rules in place at 640px - GOOD\n\nLooking at the page more carefully, most of the responsive patterns are already implemented. The page has padding adjustments for smaller screens, button text hiding, column hiding in the table, card mode at 480px, modal responsiveness, and header flex wrapping. But I'm noticing there might be some gaps worth addressing.\n\nThe AccountHeader metadata row uses fixed inline spacing that could wrap better on narrow viewports with reduced gaps, and there's an inline margin style in AccountDetailPage that should probably be a class for consistency. Beyond that though, the page is actually pretty well set up for responsive design already—padding, typography scaling, button text, column hiding, and card mode are all handled. Looking at the TrackedMaterialsTable behavior at narrow viewports, the hidden columns are already handled correctly since they disappear below 768px, leaving just the material name, quantity, and actions visible in card mode. The first and last children get appropriate flex styling for that layout. I should also verify whether the account description appears anywhere on the page—checking the AccountDetailPage, it seems to only show up in the edit modal, not in the main view.\n\nSo the page structure is pretty minimal: just the AccountHeader with breadcrumb and metadata, plus the TrackedMaterialsTable. The main improvements I need to make are converting the inline styles in AccountHeader's metadata row to be responsive with proper classes, and switching that hardcoded marginTop value in AccountDetailPage to use a class-based approach instead. Though I'm noticing this project uses custom CSS classes mimicking Tailwind naming rather than Tailwind itself, so I'll need to work within that constraint. Looking at the skill requirements more carefully, most of the responsive patterns are already implemented - column hiding at breakpoints, card mode at 480px for the table, button wrapping at 640px. The main thing I need to do is convert that inline margin style in AccountDetailPage to use a utility class instead. Modifying the metadata row's inline styles to add `flexWrap: \"wrap\"` so it breaks properly on narrow viewports without needing JavaScript-based layout switching. and Actions with just an icon at the end with margin-left: auto. At 480px the text label is already hidden, so that works fine.\n\nLet me trace through the card mode logic more carefully. With `display: none !important` hiding the Category and Unit of Measure cells, only Material Name, Total Quantity, and Actions remain visible. The first-child selector targets Material Name, last-child targets Actions, and Total Quantity sits between them naturally. This should render correctly.\n\nSince Total Quantity already includes the unit and batch count in its cell content, the hidden Unit of Measure column doesn't create any information gaps. I think the responsive behavior is solid—I just need to add flex-wrap to the metadata row in AccountHeader.tsx and the existing CSS rules should handle the
