This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input).

[2026-02-24T03:15:55.001Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Essynjgo1D5WAViKRUao6C","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a clear picture. The DealsListPage:\n1. Has components listed in tests.md but NO test entries (just a placeholder comment)\n2. Has NO implementation - the components are placeholder pages\n3. Has NO Playwright test files for the deals list page\n\nLet me now look at the AppSpec to understand what's expected for the DealsListPage, and check the mockup images to understand what elements should be tested.\n\nSince:\n- **Job 1 (CheckTestSpecDealsListPage)**: The DealsListPage section in tests.md has component descriptions but NO test entries. This is a violation of testSpec.md directives which require test entries for every interactive element.\n\n\n- **Job 2 (CheckComponentsDealsListPage)**: No components exist - the page is a placeholder. This is a violation of writeApp.md directives.\n- **Job 3 (CheckTestsDealsListPage)**: No Playwright tests exist. This is a violation of writeTests.md directives.\n\nBut I need to reconsider what the checking jobs actually mean. The strategy asks me to look for violations of directives in existing documentation and code, not necessarily to flag missing implementations. Let me review the strategy document more carefully to understand what constitutes a violation versus what's simply incomplete.\n\nFor Job 1, the tests.md file has component descriptions for DealsListPage but no test entries at all. According to testSpec.md, I should have test entries for every visible element in the mockup, so the absence of these entries is a clear violation of the directive to systematically inventory and write tests for each element.\n\nThe real issue here is distinguishing between missing implementations (which need to be built) versus directive violations in existing documentation (which need to be fixed). Since there's nothing documented yet, I should note what's missing rather than trying to fix non-existent violations. Looking at the test entries for DealsListPage, there's nothing there—just a placeholder comment. I need to identify what's actually missing: the component list exists, but there are no test entries, no component implementations beyond placeholders, and no Playwright tests written yet.\n\nSince the PlanComponent jobs for DealsListPage were never completed, I should create fix groups for the missing test entries. This is a substantial task that involves writing test specifications for all six components, but it's the right approach to address the testSpec.md directive violation. that needs to be rebuilt. So for this checking job, I should focus on what violations exist in the current state: the test entries are missing entirely, there's no component code to validate against writeApp directives, and no test files exist to check against writeTests directives. I'll report these as violations and create fix groups for the missing test entries. I'm realizing the missing test entries for DealsListPage are a real violation of the testSpec directive that requires documenting every UI element. For the components and tests that don't exist at all, I'll note those as incomplete but acknowledge there's nothing to check for directive violations in non-existent code.\n\nThe core issue is that these missing artifacts represent violations of the writeApp and writeTests phases, but the checkDirectives job itself is about examining existing code and docs for compliance, not building missing features. So I need to focus on what actually exists to check against the directives, and note where the gaps prevent a full review. I need to check the AppSpec.md file to see what components and structure the DealsListPage should have, so I can determine what test entries are actually

Let me systematically check each job.\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecDealsListPage\n\nThe DealsListPage section in tests.md has:\n- Component list: DealsSummaryCards, DealsViewTabs, DealsFilters, DealsTable, CreateDealButton, Pagination\n- NO test entries at all - just a comment `<!-- Test entries will be added by PlanComponent jobs -->`\n\nLooking at the mockup, I can see:\n\n**Summary Cards**: \n- Total Active Deals: 124\n- Pipeline Value: $4.5M\n- Won (Q3): 32 ($1.2M) \n\n\n- Lost (Q3): 18 ($0.6M)\n\n**View Tabs**: Table View, Pipeline View\n\n**Filters**: Stage, Client, Status, Date Range, Sort by Close Date, and a search input. **Table columns**: Deal Name, Client, Stage, Owner, Value, Close Date, Status with badges like On Track or At Risk, plus an action menu. There's also a Create New Deal button in the top right and pagination showing Page 1 of 9.\n\nNow I'm checking the page structure against the test specification — I need to verify that every visible element has a corresponding test entry, including the sidebar navigation, page title with breadcrumb, and all interactive components. So far none of these elements have test coverage defined.\n\nThe DealsListPage component itself was never actually built, only stubbed in the main app file, so there's no implementation to validate against the component directives. Similarly, no Playwright tests exist yet for this page, which means I need to create the test entries from scratch to satisfy the specification requirements. The core issue is that tests.md is missing test entries for DealsListPage despite the testSpec.md directive requiring them, so I need to create a fix group that adds those entries following the checkDirectives strategy pattern. Since the components and tests don't exist yet, there's no directive violation to check in the code itself—those are build tasks separate from this directive compliance work. I'm realizing the standard three-job pattern might not fit here since adding test entries to tests.md doesn't require actual code testing or separate documentation—the entries themselves are the fix. Let me reconsider whether I should just use the FixViolation job alone or adapt the pattern to make sense for this particular task.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully, the missing test entries do represent a violation of the directive to systematically inventory every visible element, regardless of whether another job was supposed to fill them in. The current state is incomplete, so I should report the findings and create a fix group to add those

This violates multiple testSpec.md directives including \"systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"write a test entry for each one.\" Added a fix group to populate the missing test entries.\n\n### Job 2 — CheckComponentsDealsListPage\n**No violations found:** No DealsListPage component code exists — the route renders a `PlaceholderPage`. Since there is no code, there are no writeApp.md directive violations to check.\n\n### Job 3 — CheckTestsDealsListPage\n**No violations found:** No Playwright test files exist for the DealsListPage. Since there are no tests, there are no writeTests.md directive violations to check.\n\n<DONE>","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"5be46a63-c415-4f16-91f8-743417fcd2ff","total_cost_usd":1.0962854499999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":18,"cache_creation_input_tokens":45086,"cache_read_input_tokens":733728,"output_tokens":8770,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":45086},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":18,"outputTokens":8770,"cacheReadInputTokens":733728,"cacheCreationInputTokens":45086,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.8679915,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":32801,"outputTokens":10547,"cacheReadInputTokens":737067,"cacheCreationInputTokens":55241,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.22829394999999997,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"3a72f04b-ac8d-4251-971d-4a1adcbfe47c"}
