Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":113,"startLine":1,"totalLines":113}}}

I need to create a NEW clean merge branch from origin/main\n3. Then cherry-pick the relevant paths\n\nBut wait - the current branch IS the merge branch. The source should be the branch that has the original work. Let me check what branches exist.\n\nActually, looking at the git log more carefully:\n- The current branch `report-testFailures-sales-crm-2-review-5-20260224-164241-merge` has merges from `origin/sales-crm-2-review-5`\n\n\n- So the source branch with all the work is `origin/sales-crm-2-review-5`\n\nThe procedure says I should create a clean merge branch from main and then apply changes from the source branch. Since this branch already has multiple prior MergeSkills commits, it looks like the procedure has been attempted and possibly failed before. I need to start fresh with a new clean branch from origin/main and cherry-pick the relevant changes from the source.\n\nLet me check what's actually different between this branch and main to understand what needs to be applied.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":780,"cache_read_input_tokens":27088,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":780,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"72356046-0b93-47d4-8079-d05bc680388e","uuid":"b558f402-85f1-408c-a036-374782a92114"}
