The test spec (docs/tests.md) says:\n\n**DescribeAppForm: Validation requires App Name**\n> A validation error message is displayed near the App Name field indicating it is required.\n\n**DescribeAppForm: Validation requires Description**\n> A validation error message is displayed near the Description field indicating it is required.\n\nBut the current implementation just disables the submit button - there are no per-field validation error messages. The tests also just check that the submit button is disabled, not that validation messages appear.\n\nI need to:\n1. Update the component to show per-field validation error messages when submit is attempted with empty fields\n\n\n2. Update the tests to check for these validation messages instead of just the button state\n3.

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx replayio install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\n    99→operations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n   100→\n   101→- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n   102→- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n   103→- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n   104→\n   105→Example:\n   106→\n   107→```ts\n   108→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   109→import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n   110→\n   111→export default defineConfig({\n   112→  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n   113→  actionTimeout: 15000,\n   114→  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n   115→  reporter: [\n   116→    replayReporter({\n   117→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   118→      upload: false,\n   119→    }),\n   120→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   121→    ['list'],\n   122→  ],\n   123→  use: {\n   124→    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n   125→  },\n   126→});\n   127→```\n   128→\n   129→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   130→\n   131→- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   132→- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   133→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   134→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   135→- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   136→- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   137→- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   138→  data accumulating).\n   139→\n   140→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   141→\n   142→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   143→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   144→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   145→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   146→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   147→\n   148→### 7. Pre-test verification\n   149→\n   150→Before running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n   151→\n   152→```bash\n   153→ls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n   154→```\n   155→\n   156→If it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\n   157→without the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\n   158→Do not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n   159→\n   160→## Running Tests\n   161→\n   162→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\n   163→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   164→\n   165→- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n   166→- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n   167→- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n   168→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   169→\n   170→## Debugging\n   171→\n   172→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   173→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   174→\n   175→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   176→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   177→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   178→   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   179→   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   180→   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   181→   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   182→   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   183→   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   184→   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   185→3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   186→   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   187→   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   188→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   189→   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   190→   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   191→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   192→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   193→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   194→   making any changes.\n   195→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   196→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   197→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   198→   on what you found.\n   199→8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   200→   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   201→   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n   202→\n   203→### Bug Writeup Template\n   204→\n   205→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   206→\n   207→```\n   208→# Bug: <test name>\n   209→\n   210→## Step 1: Evidence\n   211→\n   212→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   213→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   214→no evidence.>\n   215→\n   216→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   217→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   218→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   219→\n   220→## Step 2: Determination\n   221→\n   222→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   223→\n   224→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   225→\n   226→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   227→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   228→```\n   229→\n   230→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   231→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   232→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   233→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   234→\n   235→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   236→\n   237→## Directives\n   238→\n   239→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   240→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   241→  zombie processes and port conflicts.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: The Replay Chromium browser adds instrumentation overhead that makes all\noperations ~2–3x slower than standard Chromium. Always set higher timeouts from the start:\n\n- `actionTimeout: 15000` (15s for clicks, fills, etc.)\n- `navigationTimeout: 30000` (30s for page navigations)\n- Use `expect.toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })` for post-navigation assertions\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // Replay Chromium is slower due to instrumentation — use generous timeouts\n  actionTimeout: 15000,\n  navigationTimeout: 30000,\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n### 7. Pre-test verification\n\nBefore running tests for the first time in an app, verify the Replay browser is installed:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\nIf it does not exist, run `npx replayio install` before any test execution. Running tests\nwithout the Replay browser means failures produce no recordings, making debugging impossible.\nDo not defer Replay installation to after failures are discovered.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `skills/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- The script prints a one-line summary to stdout (e.g., `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`).\n- Full test output and recording metadata are in the log file referenced by the summary.\n- Read the log file only when you need to diagnose failures.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `skills/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `skills/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `skills/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `skills/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `skills/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `skills/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `skills/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `skills/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording ID in the `npm run test` summary line (e.g.,\n   `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`). If the summary\n   doesn't include a recording ID, read the log file and look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines.\n   If the upload did not happen, use `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and\n   upload them manually: `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n8. After fixing the failure, commit your changes and announce:\n   CHANGESET REVISION: <git rev-parse HEAD> FAILING TEST: <test name>\n   This line MUST appear in the log exactly as formatted — report tools search for it.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- The Playwright `webServer` command should also include `--functions ./netlify/functions` when\n  using Netlify Functions, to ensure function endpoints resolve correctly during test runs.\n  Example: `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish.

Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n    25→\n    26→4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n    27→   test data.\n    28→\n    29→5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n    30→   prior runs.\n    31→\n    32→6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n    33→   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n    34→   `DATABASE_URL`.

Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n    41→      which crashes on large suites).

Upload with\n    54→      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, append `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` to the\n    55→      log file. On failure, log the exit code.\n    56→\n    57→9. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n    58→   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n    59→\n    60→10. **Print summary** to stdout: a single line like `10 passed` or\n    61→    `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`. Include the uploaded recording ID\n    62→    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n    63→\n    64→11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n    65→\n    66→## Inputs\n    67→\n    68→- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n    69→- **Environment variables**:\n    70→  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n    71→  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n    72→  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`.

This is the single entry point for running\ntests during development and debugging.\n\n## Usage\n\n- `package.json` entry: `\"test\": \"tsx scripts/test.ts\"`\n- Required argument: a test file path (e.g., `npm run test tests/clients-list-page.spec.ts`).\n- Example: `npm run test tests/auth.spec.ts`\n\n## Behavior\n\n1. **Kill stale processes**: Kill any leftover `netlify` or `vite` dev server processes from\n   previous runs.\n\n2. **Clean up stale Neon branches**: List existing Neon branches and delete any that match the\n   test branch naming convention (e.g., `test-worker-*`) from interrupted previous runs.\n\n3. **Create ephemeral Neon branch**: Create a fresh branch from the project's main branch for\n   this test run. Name it with a convention like `test-worker-{run-id}`.\n\n4. **Initialize and seed**: Run `initSchema` on the new branch, then run migrations, then seed\n   test data.\n\n5. **Remove stale recordings**: Run `npx replayio remove --all` to clear local recordings from\n   prior runs.\n\n6. **Run Playwright**: Run `npx playwright test <testFile>` with `--retries 0` against the\n   specified test file. The Playwright config handles starting the dev server with the branch's\n   `DATABASE_URL`. Pipe all Playwright output to a log file (see Outputs).\n\n7. **Parse results**: Count passed/failed/skipped tests from the Playwright JSON reporter output\n   at `test-results/results.json`.\n\n8. **On failure** (non-zero exit code):\n   a. Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` with a built-in parser (NOT `npx replayio list --json`,\n      which crashes on large suites). The log is newline-delimited JSON with `kind` field:\n      `createRecording`, `addMetadata`, `writeStarted`, `writeFinished`, etc.\n   b. Append full metadata for every recording that has test metadata to the log file in a\n      delimited block:\n      ```\n      === REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      {\"id\":\"...\",\"testResult\":\"failed\",\"testTitle\":\"...\",\"specFile\":\"...\"}\n      ...\n      === END REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===\n      ```\n   c. Upload exactly ONE recording: among all finished recordings where\n      `metadata.test.result` is `\"failed\"` or `\"timedOut\"`, pick the one with the longest\n      duration (the real recording, not zero-duration stubs). Upload with\n      `npx replayio upload <id>`. On success, append `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` to the\n      log file. On failure, log the exit code.\n\n9. **Clean up**: Delete the ephemeral Neon branch. Remove local recordings with\n   `npx replayio remove --all`.\n\n10. **Print summary** to stdout: a single line like `10 passed` or\n    `8 passed, 2 failed — see logs/test-run-3.log`. Include the uploaded recording ID\n    if one was uploaded: `8 passed, 2 failed (recording: abc123) — see logs/test-run-3.log`.\n\n11. **Exit** with the original Playwright exit code.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Required argument**: Test file path (e.g., `tests/auth.spec.ts`).\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon branch management.\n  - `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` (required): For Replay recording uploads.\n  - `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (required): Read from `.env`. The Neon project to branch from.\n  - `DATABASE_URL` (required): Read from `.env`. The main branch connection string used as\n    template for ephemeral branches.\n  - `REPLAY_CLI` (optional): Override the Replay CLI command (default: `replayio`, assumed\n    globally installed). Useful for pointing at a local build or alternate installation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Project configuration (Neon project ID, database URL, etc.).\n  - `~/.replay/recordings.log`: Replay recording metadata (read after test run).\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **stdout**: One-line summary only. Never verbose test output.\n- **`logs/test-run-N.log`**: Full Playwright output, recording metadata, and upload results.\n  `N` increments each run (find the highest existing number and add 1).\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates and deletes ephemeral Neon branches.\n  - Uploads failed Replay recordings.\n  - Removes local recording files.\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: All tests passed.\n  - Non-zero: Test failures (matches Playwright's exit code).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` and the seed logic from `scripts/seed-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon API directly (`fetch` to `https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) for branch\n  creation and deletion. The API key is `NEON_API_KEY`.\n- Parse `~/.replay/recordings.log` in TypeScript — it's newline-delimited JSON. The\n  `addMetadata` entries contain `metadata.test.result` which indicates pass/fail.\n- The Playwright config must use the Replay browser via `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`\n  from `@replayio/playwright` and include `replayReporter` with `upload: false`.\n- The HTML reporter must use `open: 'never'` to suppress the interactive \"Serving HTML report\"\n  prompt that blocks the script from exiting.\n- Run Playwright with `--retries 0` — no retries. Failures must be analyzed via Replay.\n- Do NOT inherit stdio from Playwright. Pipe stdout and stderr to the log file using\n  `child_process.execSync` with `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` or similar, then write\n  the captured output to the log file.\n- Use the JSON reporter (`test-results/results.json`) to parse pass/fail counts for the\n  summary line.\n- The `RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` env var is already set in the container.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

So Playwright IS running successfully but the test script's results parser may not be generating/finding the results JSON file.\n\nLet me check the test script to see how it parses results.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":185,"cache_read_input_tokens":53724,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":185,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a3dae88d-ba17-44f3-b4d4-dfdd9a00a525","uuid":"48017224-bd4f-4c52-9d2b-d9c9cfc7fb33"}

That's very suspicious. The fact that recordings are being created (27 of them with duration 0) but there's no Playwright output suggests that Playwright is not properly writing to stdout/stderr, or maybe it's using an alternate output stream.\n\nThe fact that results.json doesn't exist could mean:\n1. Playwright ran but the JSON reporter didn't write the file\n2. Playwright failed to even start tests properly\n\nLooking at the spawnSync call - it's using `stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe']` which should capture stdout and stderr. But both are empty.\n \nWait, those 27 recordings with `duration: 0` and `testResult: \"passed\"` are actually stub recordings - they're not real test runs. And the missing testTitle and specFile in the metadata suggests the recordings aren't capturing the full test context. Could the tests actually be passing but Playwright is exiting with a non-zero code for some other reason? The zero results from `parsePlaywrightResults()` might be because it's trying to read from results.json which doesn't exist.\n\nActually, the recordings section only shows up when Playwright fails, so the script is definitely seeing a non-zero exit code. But all those recordings show passed tests with zero duration, which is contradictory. Let me run the tests directly with Playwright to see what's actually happening.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5222,"cache_read_input_tokens":53909,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5222,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a3dae88d-ba17-44f3-b4d4-dfdd9a00a525","uuid":"c68dd632-0baf-4ae0-86aa-ca8104290c92"}

Here's a summary of the changes:\n\n**DescribeAppForm.tsx** - Changed from disabled-button validation to per-field error messages:\n- Added `useState` for `submitted` flag, set to `true` on form submit\n- Removed `disabled` prop from submit button (button is always clickable)\n- Added `app-name-error` span near App Name field showing \"App Name is required\" when submitted with empty name\n- Added `app-description-error` span near Description field showing \"Description is required\" when submitted with empty description\n- Validation still prevents form submission when fields are empty\n\n**DescribeAppForm.css** - Added `.describe-app-form__field-error` style for per-field error messages\n\n**request-page.spec.ts** - Updated both validation tests:\n- \"Validation requires App Name\": Now clicks submit (not force-click on disabled button) and asserts `app-name-error` is visible with \"required\" text\n- \"Validation requires Description\": Now clicks submit and asserts `app-description-error` is visible with \"required\" text\n\n**Test results**: 31/32 tests pass.
