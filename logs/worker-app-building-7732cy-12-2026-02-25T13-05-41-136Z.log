ProductionHub docs for additional planning info.\n[read] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md\n[read] /repo/apps/AppStyle.md\nNow I have a comprehensive picture. Let me analyze what shared code is needed for ProductionHub.\n\nThere are multiple other apps (InventoryTracker, Accounting are built; SupplierTracker, SalesCRM are specs only). I need to identify code that can be shared across apps.\n\n**Analysis of shared code opportunities:**\n\n1. **App-wide logic** - Auth, store, backend, layout, styles already exist in shared/. But Accounting has an inline Breadcrumb component in its NavBar that should be extracted since ProductionHub needs breadcrumbs on RunDetailsPage, RecipeDetailsPage, and EquipmentDetailsPage. Also, ConfirmDialog is... (truncated)\n\n2. **RecipesPage / EquipmentPage** - Both need a Pagination component (RecipesTable uses <<, <, >, >> buttons; EquipmentTable uses <, > with \"Page X of Y\"). This pattern is needed by other apps' list pages too.\n\n3. **EquipmentDetailsPage** - MaintenanceNotes is a comment system (author, role, date, text, reverse chronological). SupplierTracker spec has \"Comments added for notes about the supplier\" - nearly identical pattern. SalesCRM has timeline with notes. This should be a shared CommentsSection component... (truncated)\n\nPages like CalendarPage, RunDetailsPage, and RecipeDetailsPage don't have unique shared code needs beyond what's covered above.\n\nLet me create the unpacked subtasks:\n$ npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md\" --subtask \"WriteSharedAppWide: Write/refactor shared app-wide code for ProductionHub - extract Breadcrumb component from Accounting NavBar into apps/shared/components, create shared ConfirmDialog component\" --subtask \"WriteSha... (truncated)\nAdded task at front: 3 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md)\n  - WriteSharedAppWide: Write/refactor shared app-wide code for ProductionHub - extract Breadcrumb component from Accounting NavBar into apps/shared/components, create shared ConfirmDialog component\n  - WriteSharedRecipesEquipment: Write/refactor shared Pagination component for ProductionHub RecipesPage and EquipmentPage paginated tables\n  - WriteSharedEquipmentDetails: Write/refactor shared CommentsSection component for ProductionHub EquipmentDetailsPage MaintenanceNotes (also needed by SupplierTracker)\nQueue now has 54 task(s).\nThe unpack subtask is complete. I've analyzed ProductionHub's requirements against the other apps and identified three areas where shared code is needed:\n\n1. **App-wide shared code**: Extract Breadcrumb from Accounting's NavBar into a shared component (used by ProductionHub's RunDetailsPage, RecipeDetailsPage, EquipmentDetailsPage), and create a shared ConfirmDialog (used for delete/cancel confirmations across multiple apps).\n\n2. **Pagination component**: Shared by ProductionHub's RecipesTable and EquipmentTable, and needed by other apps' list pages.\n\n3. **CommentsSection component**: Shared by ProductionHub's EquipmentDetailsPage (MaintenanceNotes) and SupplierTracker's SupplierDetailsPage (comments).\n\nThese subtasks have been queued for the next worker iteration.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 275183ms | Turns: 18 | Cost: $2.2337\nCost: $2.2337 (total: $57.1895)\nTurns: 18\nTask signaled <DONE>.

ProductionHub docs for additional planning info.\n[read] /repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md\n[read] /repo/apps/AppStyle.md\nNow I have a comprehensive picture. Let me analyze what shared code is needed for ProductionHub.\n\nThere are multiple other apps (InventoryTracker, Accounting are built; SupplierTracker, SalesCRM are specs only). I need to identify code that can be shared across apps.\n\n**Analysis of shared code opportunities:**\n\n1. **App-wide logic** - Auth, store, backend, layout, styles already exist in shared/. But Accounting has an inline Breadcrumb component in its NavBar that should be extracted since ProductionHub needs breadcrumbs on RunDetailsPage, RecipeDetailsPage, and EquipmentDetailsPage. Also, ConfirmDialog is... (truncated)\n\n2. **RecipesPage / EquipmentPage** - Both need a Pagination component (RecipesTable uses <<, <, >, >> buttons; EquipmentTable uses <, > with \"Page X of Y\"). This pattern is needed by other apps' list pages too.\n\n3. **EquipmentDetailsPage** - MaintenanceNotes is a comment system (author, role, date, text, reverse chronological). SupplierTracker spec has \"Comments added for notes about the supplier\" - nearly identical pattern. SalesCRM has timeline with notes. This should be a shared CommentsSection component... (truncated)\n\nPages like CalendarPage, RunDetailsPage, and RecipeDetailsPage don't have unique shared code needs beyond what's covered above.\n\nLet me create the unpacked subtasks:\n$ npx tsx scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md\" --subtask \"WriteSharedAppWide: Write/refactor shared app-wide code for ProductionHub - extract Breadcrumb component from Accounting NavBar into apps/shared/components, create shared ConfirmDialog component\" --subtask \"WriteSha... (truncated)\nAdded task at front: 3 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md)\n  - WriteSharedAppWide: Write/refactor shared app-wide code for ProductionHub - extract Breadcrumb component from Accounting NavBar into apps/shared/components, create shared ConfirmDialog component\n  - WriteSharedRecipesEquipment: Write/refactor shared Pagination component for ProductionHub RecipesPage and EquipmentPage paginated tables\n  - WriteSharedEquipmentDetails: Write/refactor shared CommentsSection component for ProductionHub EquipmentDetailsPage MaintenanceNotes (also needed by SupplierTracker)\nQueue now has 54 task(s).\nThe unpack subtask is complete. I've analyzed ProductionHub's requirements against the other apps and identified three areas where shared code is needed:\n\n1. **App-wide shared code**: Extract Breadcrumb from Accounting's NavBar into a shared component (used by ProductionHub's RunDetailsPage, RecipeDetailsPage, EquipmentDetailsPage), and create a shared ConfirmDialog (used for delete/cancel confirmations across multiple apps).\n\n2. **Pagination component**: Shared by ProductionHub's RecipesTable and EquipmentTable, and needed by other apps' list pages.\n\n3. **CommentsSection component**: Shared by ProductionHub's EquipmentDetailsPage (MaintenanceNotes) and SupplierTracker's SupplierDetailsPage (comments).\n\nThese subtasks have been queued for the next worker iteration.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 275183ms | Turns: 18 | Cost: $2.2337\nCost: $2.2337 (total: $57.1895)\nTurns: 18\nTask signaled <DONE>. Completing task.\nDequeued task: 1 subtask(s) (skill: skills/tasks/build/writeShared.md)","stderr":"","interrupted":false,"isImage":false,"noOutputExpected":false}}

The final log analyzed the shared code requirements for ProductionHub.\n\nSince none of these logs encountered any test failures, I need to generate analysis files for all ten entries using the reportTestFailures template, setting TEST_FAILURES to 0 for each one.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11253,"cache_read_input_tokens":38992,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11253,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a051109f-d78a-47f9-8f0f-5b49eb8606a5","uuid":"b011052a-d2cd-4c01-908e-81e35851932e"}
