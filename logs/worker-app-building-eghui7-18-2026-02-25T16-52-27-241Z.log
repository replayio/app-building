A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions.

The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`.

Let me now check the directives from testSpec.md to see if this is a violation.\n\nLooking at testSpec.md directives:\n1. \"Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\"\n\n\n2. \"Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\"\n3. \"For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\"\n4. \"For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly.\"\n5. \"Button and control appearance matters.\"\n6. \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\"\n\nThe TransactionsPage has zero test entries at all - just a placeholder comment. This is a major violation of the testSpec directives, especially the first one about systematically inventorying every visible element. The page lists components like NewTransactionButton, DateRangeFilter, AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, TransactionTypeFilter, SearchBar, TransactionsTable, and Pagination, but none of them have corresponding test entries.\n\nI need to check what the actual TransactionsPage code and test files contain to understand what's already implemented versus what needs test coverage.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11258,"cache_read_input_tokens":49135,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":11258,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"442ac98a-98f9-4335-8cea-ab529353c1ce","uuid":"5f72187e-8653-4043-ae1a-18b867634042"}

The TransactionsPage is a stub - just a heading \"Transactions\" with no real content\n2. There are no test files for transactions \n3. The tests.md has no test entries for TransactionsPage - only a placeholder comment\n4. Components listed: NewTransactionButton, DateRangeFilter, AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, TransactionTypeFilter, SearchBar, TransactionsTable, Pagination\n5. Only some of these components exist (NewTransactionButton, DateRangeFilter). Many don't exist yet (AccountFilter, MaterialFilter, TransactionTypeFilter, SearchBar, TransactionsTable, Pagination)\n\n\n6. The TransactionsPage section in tests.md violates the testSpec.md directive to systematically inventory every visible element - it's completely empty except for a placeholder comment, so I need to add a task to write proper test entries for this page.\n\nNow I'm checking what components actually exist versus what's needed for the transactions feature.\n\nThe TransactionsPage is currently just a stub with an h1 heading, and the listed components either don't exist or aren't being used. This violates several writeApp.md directives about clean working code, proper component abstraction, and data-testid attributes. However, since there are no test entries yet for this page, the implementation likely hasn't started - the tests need to come first before I can properly verify the components against them.\n\nLooking at this more carefully, I need to distinguish between the three subtasks: checking test entries against testSpec.md directives (where the violation is a missing placeholder), checking the component code against writeApp.md directives (where the violation is that it's unimplemented), and checking playwright tests against writeTests.md directives (where there are none yet).\n\nThe core issue is that TransactionsPage was scaffolded but never completed, so I need to create fix tasks that address each violation
