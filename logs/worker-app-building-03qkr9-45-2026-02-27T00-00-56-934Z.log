You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a skill or prompt.\n","numLines":115,"startLine":1,"totalLines":115}}}

needs responsive UI work on AccountsPage. All file contents have been provided in full above, including:\n\n1. The AccountsPage main component with modals and dialogs\n2. The AccountsList component that displays accounts in a table\n3. The AccountRowActions component with action buttons\n4. The Breadcrumb shared component\n5. The ConfirmDialog shared component\n6. The complete index.css with all styling and responsive breakpoints\n\nThe responsive design is already partially implemented with CSS classes like `max-sm:hidden`, `max-md:hidden`, `max-lg:hidden` and media queries at breakpoints: 1024px, 768px, 640px, and 480px."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ac5d78629eaad6e23 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 53364\ntool_uses: 14\nduration_ms: 84679</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ff5e0fba-dd61-424c-99b4-8f5d13d252a9","uuid":"e9b9bdda-af65-4ae7-91e1-75e540cbacda","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Search across all apps in /repo/apps/ for:\n1.

needs responsive UI work on AccountsPage. All file contents have been provided in full above, including:\n\n1. The AccountsPage main component with modals and dialogs\n2. The AccountsList component that displays accounts in a table\n3. The AccountRowActions component with action buttons\n4. The Breadcrumb shared component\n5. The ConfirmDialog shared component\n6. The complete index.css with all styling and responsive breakpoints\n\nThe responsive design is already partially implemented with CSS classes like `max-sm:hidden`, `max-md:hidden`, `max-lg:hidden` and media queries at breakpoints: 1024px, 768px, 640px, and 480px."}],"totalDurationMs":84679,"totalTokens":53364,"totalToolUseCount":14,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2453,"cache_read_input_tokens":35572,"output_tokens":15333,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2453},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

The InventoryTracker app needs responsive work on AccountsPage. Let me read the plan.md to see what needs to be done, and then examine the current state of the AccountsPage and its components.\n\nLooking at the exploration results:\n1. InventoryTracker has an AccountsPage that needs responsive work\n2. The AccountsPage already has some responsive classes (p-6, max-sm:p-3)\n3.

Has modals with `modal-content` class.\n- AccountsList.tsx: Already has `max-lg:hidden` on Account Type column, `max-md:hidden` on Description column, and `max-sm:hidden` on button labels.\n- AccountRowActions.tsx: Uses inline styles for flex layout.\n- index.css: Already has responsive breakpoints at 1024px, 768px, 640px, and 480px with card mode.\n\n\n- Looking at what's already implemented, the responsive design is pretty comprehensive—padding scales down on mobile, columns hide at appropriate breakpoints, button text disappears on small screens, and the table converts to card mode at 480px with modals and headers already responsive.\n\n- Checking the modal footer specifically, it might need flex-wrap added for narrower viewports to prevent overflow.\n\n- The AccountsPage seems well-covered overall, but I should compare it against the DashboardPage changes to see if there's a pattern I'm missing. I'm seeing that most of the responsive patterns are already in place through CSS, but the modal footer is missing the `flex-wrap` class that would help it handle narrow viewports better. Let me check if there's a DashboardPage example to see how these responsive improvements were applied elsewhere, then identify the specific Tailwind classes that need to be added to ensure all the skill's patterns are properly implemented across the components. sPage.tsx**: The page already has `p-6 max-sm:p-3`. The `page-title` heading doesn't have explicit Tailwind responsive sizing - it relies on CSS. Let me keep CSS since it's already there.\n\n2. **AccountsList.tsx**: Column hiding is done. Button text hiding is done. What about the `section-card-body` padding? It uses inline `style={{ padding: 0 }}` which overrides CSS padding. That's fine since the table fills the card.\n\n3. **Modals**: The `modal-footer` should have `flex-wrap` added via CSS.\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-read the AccountsList more carefully. There's `<th>Actions</th>` which doesn't have any hiding. The actions column should always be visible so that's correct.\n\nI think the page is already mostly responsive. Looking at what actually needs work: the `modal-footer` needs `flex-wrap` for narrow viewports, and I should check if `form-row` needs to collapse to a single column at smaller sizes. Scanning through the modals in AccountsPage, they don't use `form-row` - each field is wrapped in its own `form-group`, so that's not an issue. The main components here are the page wrapper with proper padding, the responsive page title, three AccountsList sections with tables, two modals, and a shared confirm dialog. Looking at the responsive behavior at 480px, the table switches to card mode where only the account name and actions columns are visible since the type and description columns have responsive hiding classes applied. But I'm noticing those classes use Tailwind syntax, which doesn't match the plain CSS approach used elsewhere in the app—I need to verify how these breakpoints are actually being handled in the stylesheet. Writing responsive styles... Looking at the card mode layout at 480px, the account name and action buttons just flow sequentially, which might work fine for icon buttons but could benefit from making the name full-width and pushing the actions to the right for better visual hierarchy. I'm also wondering whether the AccountsPage needs explicit text sizing classes for smaller screens.\n\nRe-reading the responsive design guidelines, Tailwind utility classes should be the primary approach with raw CSS as a fallback, so I should focus on what specific improvements would make the page more responsive using that methodology. I'm checking what responsive improvements were made in the DashboardPage to see if there are similar patterns I should apply

Let me analyze what's already done and what still needs improvement for the AccountsPage:\n\n**Already done (CSS-level):**\n1. Page padding responsive (`p-6 max-sm:p-3` class + CSS) ✓\n2. Page title scaling to 20px at 640px ✓\n3. Account type header flex-wrap at 640px ✓\n4. Account type title scaling to 16px at 640px ✓\n5. Modal content width constraint at 640px ✓\n6. Section card responsive padding at 640px ✓\n\n\n7. Table card mode at 480px ✓\n8. Column hiding utility classes at 1024px, 768px, 640px ✓\n\n**Already done (Component-level):**\n1. `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on AccountsPage wrapper ✓\n2. `max-lg:hidden` on Account Type column ✓\n3. `max-md:hidden` on Description column ✓\n4. `max-sm:hidden` on create button labels ✓\n\n**What needs improvement:**\nThe modal footer needs `flex-wrap` to handle narrow viewports safely, and there are a few other refinements to address.\n\nThe modal title should scale down from 18px to 16px on smaller screens. The form-row class would normally collapse to a single column at 640px, but the AccountsPage modals don't actually use it, so that's not a concern here.\n\nFor the 480px card mode specifically, I'm thinking through how the table columns should behave—the Account Name and Actions stay visible while Account Type and Description are already hidden at larger breakpoints. I need to verify the Account Name displays prominently in card mode at that breakpoint and the Actions align properly.\n\nAdding styles to make the name cell full-width...\n\nNow I'm verifying the responsive requirements against what's already implemented. The card mode at 480px is working correctly with just name and actions showing. I need to check the other constraints—the modal footer needs `flex-wrap` added, and the modal width and overflow properties are already in place. So the main improvement needed is adding `flex-wrap` to the modal footer.\n\nFor the implementation, I'm deciding whether to use inline Tailwind classes or CSS for the responsive adjustments. Since the existing CSS already handles these and the DashboardPage follows the same pattern, I'll stick with CSS for consistency. The changes I need to make are adding `flex-wrap` to the modal footer at 640px and reducing the modal title font size from 18px to 16px at that breakpoint. 640px\n3. CSS: Improve 480px card mode for account-type-section tables (make name prominent, actions auto-positioned)\n\nActually wait - let me reconsider. The DashboardPage was the only one marked as done. Let me compare what was done for DashboardPage vs what needs to be done for AccountsPage.\n\nThe DashboardPage already has:\n- `p-6 max-sm:p-3` on wrapper ✓\n- `flexWrap: \"wrap\"` on filter container ✓\n- No tables of its own (uses RecentTransactionsTable component)\n\nLooking at this, the responsive changes seem to have been done primarily through CSS media queries that apply to all pages (in index.css). The AccountsPage already benefits from these CSS rules and also has its own component-level responsive classes.\n\nNow I'm thinking through what would actually look problematic at narrow viewports. Going through the breakpoints, most of the layout adjustments are already in place - columns hide at the right sizes, padding and text scale appropriately, and the table switches to card mode on mobile. The remaining gaps are pretty small: the modal footer needs to wrap at 640px, modal titles should shrink slightly to match the design spec, and there's something about the first table at 480px that needs attention.\n\nLet me just implement these polish improvements now.","signature":"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
