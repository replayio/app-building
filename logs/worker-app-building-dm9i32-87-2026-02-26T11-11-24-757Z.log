This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":82,"startLine":1,"totalLines":82}}}

This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Let me systematically check each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecNavigation - Check testSpec.md directive violations in Navigation test entries\n\nThe Navigation section of tests.md (lines 3-10):\n```\n## Navigation\n\nThe app has a consistent top navigation bar across all pages with:\n- App logo/name (\"SupplyChain Pro\")\n- Navigation links: Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders, Inventory\n- User profile icon/dropdown\n\nBreadcrumb navigation appears on detail pages (SupplierDetailsPage, OrderDetailsPage).\n```\n\nLet me check this against the testSpec.md directives:\n\n\nThe Navigation section is just a description rather than individual test entries, which violates the directive to inventory every visible element with specific BDD-style tests. I need individual entries for the logo, each navigation link, the user profile dropdown, and breadcrumbs on the detail pages. Now I'm checking the TopNavBar component against the writeApp.md directives. The data-testid attributes are properly applied across all interactive elements like the logo, navigation links, and user profile menu. Looking at the navigation items configuration, I need to verify there aren't duplicate links pointing to the same destination...\n\nActually, I'm noticing a critical issue: all four navigation items (Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders, Inventory) have onClick handlers that navigate to \"/\" regardless of their configured paths. This violates the directive against duplicate links pointing to the same URL. The hash-based paths like \"/#suppliers\" and \"/#orders\" suggest these should scroll to sections on the dashboard, but the implementation is routing everything to the root path instead.\n\nNow I'm checking the other accessibility and component requirements against the TopNavBar implementation.\n\nLooking at the breadcrumb patterns across different pages - SupplierDetailsPage shows `Home > Suppliers > <Supplier Name> > Supplier Details` and OrderDetailsPage shows `Dashboard > Orders > Order #<orderId>`, which align with the test spec. But there's a mismatch in the navigation links: the tests expect Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders, and Inventory as distinct destinations, yet the current implementation routes Suppliers, Orders, and Inventory all to \"/\" instead of their respective pages.\n\nThe real problem is that the app doesn't have dedicated list pages for Suppliers or Orders - those are just sections on the dashboard. The nav links should probably use hash anchors to scroll to the right section, but they're just navigating to \"/\" without the fragment. More critically, having four navigation items all pointing to the same URL violates the directive that each navigation item must have a unique route.\n\nThat said, this is actually how the spec is designed - there are only three page routes defined (Dashboard, SupplierDetails, OrderDetails), so the Suppliers and Orders nav items are meant to scroll within the dashboard. The real issue I'm noticing is that the Navigation section in testSpec.md has no BDD-format test entries at all, just prose description, which violates the requirement to use behavior-driven development for test entries.\n\nFor writeApp.md, the navigation links do all point to \"/\" which technically duplicates, but the spec doesn't define separate pages for these sections. The hash fragments in the links suggest they were intended to scroll to sections, though the onClick handler bypasses them. And for writeTests.md, there's no dedicated navigation test file at all, which means navigation targets aren't being verified precisely as required.\n\nLooking back at the testSpec directive, I need individual titled test entries for each navigation element—things like \"Display App Logo and Name\" or \"Dashboard Link Navigation\"—rather than just describing what the navigation bar contains. The Navigation section currently lacks these formal BDD test entries that inventory and verify each clickable element.\n\nI'm also noticing that the testSpec requires specifying exact navigation targets or action results for every interactive element, but the current description doesn't detail where each link actually goes or what the profile dropdown does when clicked.\n\nLooking at the actual component code, I see all four navigation links are calling the same navigate function with the same URL, which violates the requirement that each navigation item must have a unique route. The real issue is that the test spec needs proper BDD-formatted test entries first, then the component implementation needs to be fixed to match those specifications, and finally tests need to be

[2026-02-26T11:10:36.678Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_012ot7aeko3FAkf4AqwjZb5y","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Good - no existing tests reference `top-nav` or `breadcrumb` test IDs. There are no dedicated navigation tests.\n\nNow let me systematically go through each check and document my findings.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecNavigation\n\nThe Navigation section of tests.md (lines 3-10):\n```\n## Navigation\n\nThe app has a consistent top navigation bar across all pages with:\n- App logo/name (\"SupplyChain Pro\")\n- Navigation links: Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders, Inventory\n- User profile icon/dropdown\n\nBreadcrumb navigation appears on detail pages (SupplierDetailsPage, OrderDetailsPage).\n\n\n```\n\nLooking at the testSpec.md directives, the first one about consistency is satisfied, but the second directive about inventorying every visible element is violated. The Navigation section describes multiple components—logo, four nav links, user profile icon with dropdown, and breadcrumbs—yet provides no individual test entries for any of them.\n\nThe third and fourth directives are also failing: clickable elements like nav links, the logo, user profile, and breadcrumb links lack test entries specifying their navigation targets or actions, and there are no BDD-formatted test entries with proper titles and state-action-result descriptions in the Navigation section at all.\n\nThe fifth directive about data mutations doesn't apply here, but the sixth directive about button and control appearance is being cut off mid-sentence.\n\n```\nNow I'm checking the Navigation section against the writeApp.md directives and finding that the main issue is the complete absence of BDD-format test entries—every interactive element needs its own titled test entry describing initial state, user action, and expected outcome, including specific navigation targets for the logo, nav links, user profile dropdown, and breadcrumbs.\n\nMoving to the second subtask, I'm examining TopNavBar.tsx and immediately spotting a violation: all four nav link onClick handlers navigate to the same \"/\" route, which violates the directive that navigation items must have unique routes.\n```\nThe component does have proper data-testid coverage across all interactive elements, doesn't use native HTML selects, and the other directives either don't apply or are satisfied.\n```\n\nThe real issue is that all navigation links point to the same URL, which breaks the navigation pattern. Looking at the app structure, there are only three actual pages—Dashboard, SupplierDetails, and OrderDetails—so the nav items like \"Suppliers\" and \"Orders\" don't have corresponding destinations. I'd need to either create dedicated list pages, implement hash-based scrolling within the dashboard, or remove those nav items entirely.\n\nWait, I'm seeing that the navItems array actually does have different paths with hash fragments like `/#suppliers` and `/#orders`, but the onClick handler is overriding them and always navigating to \"/\". The fix would be to respect those hash paths and use them to scroll to the appropriate sections on the dashboard instead of ignoring them.\n\nNow looking at the test requirements, there are no navigation tests at all—no test file exists for TopNavBar or breadcrumb navigation. The tests need to verify that clicking navigation items actually takes you to the correct URL or page content, not just that a click handler exists.\n\nThe root issue is that tests.md doesn't have proper BDD test entries defined for navigation, TopNavBar links all navigate to \"/\" regardless of their intended targets, and there's no test file covering navigation at all. I need to add fix tasks that address the test spec first, then the component behavior, then the actual tests.","signature":"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
