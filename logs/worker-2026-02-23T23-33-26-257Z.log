If the bug is about existing functionality, the test entries are\n   underspecified and the problem stage is `testSpec.md` (`strategies/jobs/build/`) which covers generation of the spec.\n\n## Updating directives\n\nIf no problem stage was identified for the bug report, skip this job.\n\nRead the strategy file for the stage which breaks down how to perform the stage into\nincreasingly small and well defined tasks. These strategy files have directives for things to watch\nfor when performing a job, which are reviewed afterwards and while maintaining the app to make sure\nthey are all being followed.\n\nCheck to see if the directives already prohibit the bad behavior. If so, add a note on the entry in\nbugReports.md but make no other changes.\n\nIf there is no directive against the bad behavior, add one or update any similar / conflicting directive.\nAdd a note on the entry in bugReports.md about the update made.\n\nDirectives should be general purpose and not include details or examples specific to the app being built.\n\n## Finishing bugs\n\nUpdate `docs/bugReports.md` to move the report from the \"Unreviewed\" section to the \"Finished\" section,\ncreating it at the end if necessary.\n\nMove the report from \"Unreviewed\" to \"Finished\" in `docs/bugReports.md`.\n","numLines":73,"startLine":1,"totalLines":73}}}

The previous fix bug report iteration found the bug files in `docs/bugs/` but there's no `docs/bugReports.md` file.

Then add groups for each bug to classify, update directives, and finish them\n\nActually wait - the strategy says \"If there are any unreviewed bug reports in bugReports.md, add one group per bug\". Since there's no `bugReports.md`, there are technically no unreviewed bug reports. But the intent is clearly that these two bugs were fixed and need review. Let me look more carefully at what the fixBugReport strategy actually says about moving reports to \"Unreviewed\" - it seems like the previous iteration should have created this file but didn't, so I'm working with an incomplete state.\n\nI need to create the `bugReports.md` file with these two bugs in the \"Unreviewed\" section, including the git revision info for when they were fixed, then set up groups to classify and resolve each one.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3350,"cache_read_input_tokens":43869,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3350,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6422b589-814c-4466-a593-91eebd6a2c65","uuid":"3dc6e2ee-8792-495f-a686-82e696831c7a"}

The commit before the fix would be `4c4337a`. Let me also see what the git log for these bug files shows.\n\nNow, the strategy says I need to check `docs/bugReports.md` for unreviewed bug reports. Since no such file exists, I should create one. Looking at how the fix flow works:\n\n1. fixBugReport strategy step 5 \"ResolveBug\" says to move the bug to \"Unreviewed\" section and label with git revision before/after. This wasn't done.\n\n\n2. reviewBugReport strategy says to check for unreviewed bugs and add groups for them.\n\nSince the fix was done but the bugReports.md wasn't created, I need to create `apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md` with these two bugs in the \"Unreviewed\" section, then add groups for each bug to classify and update directives. But first I need to clarify whether the path is relative to the app directory or repo root—the strategy mentions `docs/bugReports.md` and the docs files are in `apps/SalesCRM/docs/`.\n\nSo it should be `apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md`. Let me create the file and add the groups.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":786,"cache_read_input_tokens":48215,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":786,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6422b589-814c-4466-a593-91eebd6a2c65","uuid":"af5e8bda-ec52-47c2-8eab-2a70f418752b"}
