A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n    28→\n    29→- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n    30→\n    31→- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n    32→  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n    33→  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n    34→  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n    35→  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n    36→  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n    37→\n    38→- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n    39→  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n    40→  spec files to use the same testid values.\n    41→\n    42→- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n    43→  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n    44→  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    45→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    46→\n    47→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    48→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    49→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    50→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    51→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    52→\n    53→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    54→  ```ts\n    55→  await expect(async () => {\n    56→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    57→    const count = await cards.count();\n    58→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    59→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    60→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    61→    }\n    62→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    63→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    64→  ```\n    65→\n    66→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    67→  ```ts\n    68→  await expect(\n    69→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    70→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    71→  ```\n    72→\n    73→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    74→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    79→\n    80→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    81→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    82→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    83→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    84→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    85→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    86→\n    87→## Parallel Test Design\n    88→\n    89→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n    90→Write tests with this in mind:\n    91→\n    92→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n    93→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n    94→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n    95→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n    96→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n    97→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n    98→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n    99→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   100→  being unmodified.\n   101→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   102→  you need to interact with.\n   103→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   108→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values.

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":116,"startLine":1,"totalLines":116}}}

it.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":31508,"cache_read_input_tokens":28085,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":31508,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n   165→\n   166→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   167→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   168→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   169→\n   170→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   171→\n   172→## Directives\n   173→\n   174→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   175→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   176→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   177→\n   178→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   179→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   180→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   181→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   182→\n   183→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   184→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   185→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   186→\n   187→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   188→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   189→\n   190→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   191→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   192→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   193→\n   194→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   195→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   196→\n   197→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   198→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   199→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Only after completing the Replay analysis, fix the test and/or app based on what you found.\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first.

Let me summarize what I need to do:\n\n1. **UDP-DL-01**: The test currently verifies that the deals section shows deals, but doesn't click a deal link and verify navigation to `/deals/:dealId`. The `UserDealsSection` component renders each deal as a `<Link to={/deals/${deal.id}}>`. I need to add a click assertion.\n\n2. **UDP-TSK-01**: Similarly, the test verifies tasks are visible but doesn't click a task link and verify navigation to `/tasks/:taskId`. The `UserTasksSection` component renders each task as a `<Link to={/tasks/${task.id}}>`. \n\n3. **UserActivitySection test entries**: The tests.md file doesn't have any test entries for UserActivitySection yet, so I need to add those along with their corresponding Playwright tests. Looking at the component, it displays a \"Recent Activity\" heading, renders activity events with relative timestamps and descriptions, includes client links that navigate to `/clients/:clientId`, and shows a \"No recent activity.\" message when the list is empty. I should create test entries covering these key behaviors.\n\nNow I'm ready to implement the changes.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2672,"cache_read_input_tokens":67000,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2672,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"381f4c41-f33a-49ff-9ac8-cc98cef7c4aa","uuid":"d8a5f48c-e496-4425-913a-2f2ecb557c76"}

Actually, looking at the writeTests.md directive more carefully:\n\n> NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. count(), textContent(), isVisible()) inside a .toPass() retry block\n\nThis is about .toPass() blocks specifically. Using `count()` outside of `.toPass()` is fine.\n\nBut wait, actually `locator.count()` will return 0 if no elements match (it doesn't auto-wait to get > 0). \n\nActually, I need to reconsider - `.count()` doesn't auto-wait at all, it just returns the count immediately. The auto-wait only happens with assertion methods like `.toHaveCount()`. So calling `await clientLink.count()` is perfectly fine. The real issue is that I'm chaining `.first()` before `.count()`, which doesn't make sense since `.first()` already narrows to a single element. I should restructure this to check if the activity section contains any client links directly.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1281,"cache_read_input_tokens":72010,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1281,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"381f4c41-f33a-49ff-9ac8-cc98cef7c4aa","uuid":"da0e0f57-8b1a-420d-abcf-3b3792328607"}
