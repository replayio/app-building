Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly.

Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    99→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   100→\n   101→## Tips\n   102→\n   103→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   104→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   105→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   106→  ```ts\n   107→  build: {\n   108→    sourcemap: true,\n   109→    minify: false,\n   110→  },\n   111→  define: {\n   112→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   113→  },\n   114→  ```\n   115→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   116→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4ad7a60a-f307-4ef7-9ef4-c8396c3e38d1","uuid":"5e68e8db-22a6-4cdc-a498-915a2c788e4a","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

The page includes navigation controls to move between weeks/months, and may integrate data from external inventory and delivery scheduling apps to visually indicate availability constraints (e.g., color coding runs with material shortages). Drag-and-drop or editing of events may be used to reschedule runs.

(2) Recipe and raw materials section listing each material required, the amount needed for the planned quantity, and units. (3) Forecast/availability section showing projected inventory levels for each material at the time of the run, based on data from the separate inventory tracking and delivery scheduling apps.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01XW8m1T2kQZvDguxQj1syq9","session_id":"4ad7a60a-f307-4ef7-9ef4-c8396c3e38d1","uuid":"9d30cc2d-1bf4-4632-a158-51d8cbedbe10"}

KEY SPECIFICATIONS FOR RECIPES COMPONENTS\n\nFrom `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md`, your components must support:\n\n### **RecipesHeader** (lines 7-93 in spec)\n- Page title: \"Recipes\"\n- Search bar with icon and placeholder \"Search by name or product...\" (filters recipes in real-time)\n- Filter Status dropdown: (All), Active, Draft, Archived\n- Add Recipe button (blue, primary style)\n- Search and filter work together\n\n### **RecipesTable** (lines 94-212)\n- Column headers: Recipe Name, Product, Version, Status, Actions\n- Status badges: Active (green), Draft (yellow), Archived (gray)\n- Edit pencil icon and delete trash icon in Actions column\n- Pagination: PAGE_SIZE = 5 (based on existing code patterns)\n- Version column shows \"(Draft)\" indicator when applicable (e.g., \"2.0.1 (Draft)\")\n- Clicking a row opens RecipeDetailsPanel\n- Selected row is visually highlighted\n\n### **RecipeDetailsPanel** (lines 213-296)\n- Side panel opens on the right when a row is selected\n- Title: \"Recipe Details: [Recipe Name]\"\n- Three tabs: General Info, Materials Breakdown, Instructions\n- General Info tab: Shows recipe name, product, version, status\n- Materials Breakdown tab: Table with Material, Quantity (per unit), Unit columns\n- Instructions tab: Shows recipe instructions text\n- Notes & Instructions section in Materials tab\n\n### **RecipesPage** \n- Combines all three components\n- Layout: Header at top, table on left, side panel on right (when selected)\n\n---\n\n## 3. EXISTING PATTERNS TO FOLLOW\n\n### **File Structure**\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/` - React components\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/pages/` - Page components\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/slices/` - Redux slices\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript types\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/hooks.ts` - Custom hooks\n\n### **Redux Pattern** (from `recipesSlice.ts`)\n```typescript\n- State shape: { items: Recipe[], currentRecipe: RecipeDetail | null, loading, error }\n- Async thunks: fetchRecipes, fetchRecipeById, createRecipe, updateRecipe, deleteRecipe\n- API calls to: /.netlify/functions/recipes\n- Uses: createAsyncThunk + createSlice + extraReducers pattern\n```\n\n### **Component Patterns**\n1. **Headers** (see `EquipmentHeader.tsx`)\n   - `.page-header` container with flex layout\n   - `.page-title` for main title\n   - Primary button in flex-end\n   - Modal state management with useState\n\n2. **Tables** (see `EquipmentTable.tsx`)\n   - Uses CSS Grid (not HTML tables in some cases)\n   - Pagination with custom PAGE_SIZE constant\n   - `data-testid` attributes for testing\n   - Edit/Delete modals integrated\n   - Row click to navigate\n\n3. **Modals**\n   - `.modal-overlay` + `.modal-content` structure\n   - Close button in `.modal-header`\n   - `.modal-footer` with Cancel/Submit buttons\n   - Form validation before submit\n\n4. **Status Badges**\n   - CSS classes: `.badge .badge--[status]`\n   - Classes available: active, draft, archived, scheduled, confirmed, cancelled\n\n---\n\n## 4. KEY TYPE DEFINITIONS\n\nFrom `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/types/index.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nexport type RecipeStatus = \"Active\" | \"Draft\" | \"Archived\";\n\nexport interface Recipe {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  product: string;\n  version: string;\n  status: RecipeStatus;\n  description: string;\n  instructions: string;\n  created_at: string;\n  updated_at: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RecipeMaterial {\n  id: string;\n  recipe_id: string;\n  material_name: string;\n  quantity: number;\n  unit: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RecipeProduct {\n  id: string;\n  recipe_id: string;\n  product_name: string;\n  amount: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RecipeEquipment {\n  id: string;\n  recipe_id: string;\n  equipment_id: string;\n  equipment_name?: string;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. AVAILABLE SHARED COMPONENTS\n\nLocation: `/repo/apps/shared/components/`\n\n- **Breadcrumb.tsx** - Navigation breadcrumbs\n- **Pagination.tsx** - Page navigation (use PAGE_SIZE = 5)\n- **ConfirmDialog.tsx** - Delete confirmations\n- **CommentsSection.tsx** - Comment threads (for notes)\n\n---\n\n## 6. DESIGN TOKENS & CSS VARIABLES\n\nFrom `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/index.css` and `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md`:\n\n**Colors:**\n- Primary accent: `var(--accent-primary)` = #4d7c5e (forest green)\n- Primary text: `var(--text-primary)` = #26231e\n- Secondary text: `var(--text-secondary)` = #37342e\n- Muted text: `var(--text-muted)` = #69645a\n- Background: `var(--bg-base-color)` = #faf9f7\n\n**Status Badge Colors:**\n```css\n--status-active-bg: #e6ede8;\n--status-active-text: var(--accent-primary);\n--status-draft-bg: #f5f0e3;\n--status-draft-text: var(--status-warning);\n--status-archived-bg: #f0eeea;\n--status-archived-text: var(--text-muted);\n```\n\n**Common CSS Classes:**\n- `.page-header` - Header layout\n- `.page-title` - 24px, 600 weight title\n- `.page-content` - Main content wrapper (24px padding)\n- `.btn-primary` - Green action button\n- `.btn-secondary` - Secondary button\n- `.btn-ghost` - Icon/text button\n- `.section-card` - Card container\n- `.badge` - Status badge\n- `.form-input`, `.form-textarea`, `.form-label`, `.form-group` - Form elements\n- `.modal-overlay`, `.modal-content`, `.modal-header`, `.modal-footer` - Modal structure\n- `.data-table` - HTML table styling\n\n---\n\n## 7. ROUTING SETUP\n\nFrom `App.tsx`:\n```typescript\n<Route path=\"/recipes\" element={<RecipesPage />} />  // Need to replace PlaceholderPage\n<Route path=\"/recipe/:recipeId\" element={<RecipeDetailsPage />} />\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. REDUX STORE SETUP\n\nFrom `store.ts`:\n```typescript\nexport const store = createAppStore({\n  reducer: {\n    auth: authReducer,\n    equipment: equipmentReducer,\n    recipes: recipesReducer,  // Already configured\n    runs: runsReducer,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. EXAMPLE COMPONENT PATTERNS\n\n### **Header Pattern** (from EquipmentHeader.tsx)\n- Manages modal state with `useState`\n- Dispatches async thunks on form submit\n- Modal content as separate function component\n\n### **Table Pattern** (from EquipmentTable.tsx)\n- Pagination state management\n- Edit/Delete item state\n- Row click handlers with navigate()\n- Confirm dialogs for destructive actions\n\n### **Modals** (from RecipeDetailHeader.tsx)\n- Controlled inputs with useState\n- Submit validation\n- Loading state (submitting flag)\n- Form submission prevents default\n\n---\n\n## 10. IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES\n\n1. **Search/Filter Logic**\n   - Search filters by recipe name OR product (case-insensitive)\n   - Status filter selects by exact status match\n   - Both filters apply together (AND logic)\n\n2. **Version Display**\n   - Display version as-is normally\n   - Show \"X.Y.Z (Draft)\" format if status is Draft\n\n3. **Pagination**\n   - Use PAGE_SIZE = 5 constant\n   - Disable prev/first buttons on page 1\n   - Disable next/last buttons on last page\n   - Display \"Page X of Y\" format\n\n4. **Side Panel Behavior**\n   - Opens when row is clicked\n   - Closes when selecting different row or explicit close\n   - Updates title when different recipe selected\n   - Tab selection persists during recipe switches\n\n5. **Test Attributes**\n   - All interactive elements should have `data-testid` attributes\n   - Pattern: `[component]-[element]-[item-id]` when applicable\n\n---\n\n## 11. FILE LOCATIONS FOR REFERENCE\n\n**Specs & Docs:**\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/AppSpec.md` - Full app specification\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md` - Complete test specifications\n- `/repo/apps/AppStyle.md` - Design system specification\n\n**Related Components to Study:**\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/EquipmentHeader.tsx` - Header pattern\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/EquipmentTable.tsx` - Table with pagination\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/RecipeDetailHeader.tsx` - Breadcrumb + title + edit button\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/components/RunDetailsPopup.tsx` - Side panel popup pattern\n\n**Redux Examples:**\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/slices/recipesSlice.ts` - Already configured for recipes\n- `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/slices/runsSlice.ts` - CRUD pattern example\n\n**Shared Components:**\n- `/repo/apps/shared/components/Pagination.tsx` - For pagination\n- `/repo/apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.tsx` - For breadcrumbs\n- `/repo/apps/shared/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx` - For delete confirmations\n\n---\n\n## 12. QUICK START IMPLEMENTATION ORDER\n\n1. **RecipesPage.tsx** - Main page component (layout structure)\n2. **RecipesHeader.tsx** - Search + filter + add button\n3. **RecipesTable.tsx** - Data table with pagination and edit/delete\n4. **RecipeDetailsPanel.tsx** - Side panel with three tabs\n5. **Connect in App.tsx** - Replace PlaceholderPage\n6. **Test following spec** - Use test IDs from docs/tests.md\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive overview should give you everything needed to build the Recipes components following the established patterns in your ProductionHub app. The specs are detailed with specific test cases in `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md` (over 200 specific requirements) that you can use to verify your implementation."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ab400a21abd2443ff (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 84545\ntool_uses: 26\nduration_ms: 47290</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4ad7a60a-f307-4ef7-9ef4-c8396c3e38d1","uuid":"7d8a67b5-5f72-4a85-a6c4-9b1f62e7ab1f","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the structure of the app I'm working on.

Let me also check the spec to see if there's anything about the route being shown beside the title.\n\n\nFrom REC-HDR-1: \"the page title \"Recipes\" is displayed as a large heading with the route \"/recipes\" shown beside it\"\n\nSo the title needs to show \"Recipes\" with \"/recipes\" beside it.\n\nLet me start writing. I need to be careful about data-testid attributes, using a custom dropdown for the status filter, making sure search and filter work together, implementing pagination with the shared Pagination component, opening the side panel on row click, handling tab navigation in the details panel, managing edit/delete modals, and showing \"(Draft)\" when the status is Draft.\n\nNow I'm planning out the component interfaces and how they'll interact with each other.\n\nI'll need to build the styling for the page layout with the table and side panel positioned together, plus styles for the individual components.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":14340,"cache_read_input_tokens":64473,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":14340,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":12,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4ad7a60a-f307-4ef7-9ef4-c8396c3e38d1","uuid":"9627394a-133e-430a-9097-accb128919e0"}
