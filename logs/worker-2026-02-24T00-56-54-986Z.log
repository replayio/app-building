No contact is created.\n\n### ContactsListContent\n\n#### Page displays heading and Add Contact button\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /contacts.\n- **Expected:** The page displays a heading \"Contacts\" at the top. An \"Add Contact\" button is displayed in the top-right corner of the page header. The sidebar \"Contacts\" link is highlighted as active.\n\n#### Loading state shows while contacts are being fetched\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /contacts and the API request for contacts is in progress.\n- **Expected:** A loading indicator (spinner or skeleton) is displayed in the contacts table area while data is being fetched. The search bar and page header are still visible.\n\n#### Empty state shown when no contacts match search\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded. User types \"xyznonexistent\" in the search input.\n- **Expected:** The contacts table area displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No contacts found\" or \"No matching contacts\") instead of table rows. The search bar remains visible so the user can adjust the search term.\n\n#### Empty state shown when no contacts exist\n- **Initial state:** User navigates to /contacts and there are no contacts in the system.\n- **Expected:** The contacts table area displays an empty state message (e.g., \"No contacts yet\") with a prompt or button to add the first contact. The \"Add Contact\" button remains visible in the header.\n\n#### Pagination controls appear when contacts exceed page size\n- **Initial state:** The system has more than 50 contacts.\n- **Expected:** Pagination controls are displayed below the contacts table (e.g., \"Previous\" / \"Next\" buttons or page numbers).

Each row corresponds to a contact in the system.\n\n#### CSV import button opens import dialog\n- **Initial state:** ContactsListPage is loaded.\n- **Action:** User clicks the CSV import button (or selects import from a menu).\n- **Expected:** An ImportDialog modal opens. The dialog displays a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns (Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name) with required/optional indicators and value descriptions. A \"Download CSV template\" button is available. A file upload area or file picker is present for selecting a CSV file.\n\n#### CSV import processes valid file and creates contacts\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open. User has a valid CSV file with contacts data matching the expected format.\n- **Action:** User uploads the CSV file and confirms the import.\n- **Expected:** The contacts from the CSV are created via the bulk import API. The dialog shows a success message with the count of contacts imported. After closing the dialog, the contacts table refreshes and the newly imported contacts appear in the list. Client names in the CSV are matched to existing clients in the system for association. Timeline entries are created on associated clients for newly added contacts.\n\n#### CSV import shows validation errors for invalid data\n- **Initial state:** The ImportDialog is open. User has a CSV file with invalid data (e.g., missing required Name column, malformed email).\n- **Action:** User uploads the invalid CSV file and confirms the import.\n- **Expected:** The dialog displays per-row validation errors indicating which rows failed and why (e.g., \"Row 3: Name is required\"). Valid rows may still be imported, or the user may be asked to fix errors and retry. The error messages are specific enough for the user to correct the CSV.\n\n## SettingsPage (/settings)\n\n## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n\n## UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n\n## ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n\n## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n","numLines":609,"startLine":1,"totalLines":609}}}

Add one group per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --job \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones.

Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory.

The Replay browser has recording overhead that makes it slower than standard Chrome.

Pages took 25+ seconds to render, leaving insufficient time for test assertions.\n    18→\n    19→Fix: Updated `playwright.config.ts` to use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`, increased test timeout to 60000ms, and increased webServer timeout to 60000ms.\n    20→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_013ak7rWxy1GjyHd4YEf8GgK","session_id":"4e7eed48-bc5e-4429-b901-30a32fbada40","uuid":"cd738271-9b01-47a7-aeaa-2dd72dfd50fe"}

Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me compile the final report with all the findings.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've completed a thorough search for all SettingsPage-related files in the SalesCRM app. Here are my findings:\n\n### 1. SettingsPage Component\n\n**Main Component:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` - Simple stub component that renders:\n  - A div with `data-testid=\"settings-page\"` \n  - Title \"Settings\" with consistent styling\n  - Currently minimal implementation (7 lines of code)\n\n### 2. Related Components\n\n**Sidebar Navigation (references Settings):**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.tsx` - Main sidebar wrapper component\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/SidebarNavLinks.tsx` - Contains the Settings nav link:\n  - Settings link with path `/settings` and Settings icon from lucide-react\n  - testId: `nav-link-settings`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/SidebarUserArea.tsx` - User authentication area\n\n**App Router:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` - Route definition for `/settings` element\n\n### 3. Playwright Test Files\n\n**Settings navigation tests:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/sidebar-nav.spec.ts` - Contains comprehensive tests for Settings:\n  - \"Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons\" - verifies Settings link exists\n  - \"Clicking Settings link navigates to /settings\" - tests navigation and active state highlighting\n  - \"Active link highlights based on current route\" - tests Settings link highlighting behavior\n  - \"Sidebar is persistent across all pages\" - includes Settings as one of the 6 pages tested\n\n### 4. AppSpec.md Documentation\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md` (76 lines)\n- Does NOT contain a detailed Settings page specification yet\n- Lists pages 1-6 (Clients, Contacts, Persons, Deals, Tasks)\n- SettingsPage not documented with requirements\n\n### 5.

Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me compile the final report with all the findings.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've completed a thorough search for all SettingsPage-related files in the SalesCRM app. Here are my findings:\n\n### 1. SettingsPage Component\n\n**Main Component:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` - Simple stub component that renders:\n  - A div with `data-testid=\"settings-page\"` \n  - Title \"Settings\" with consistent styling\n  - Currently minimal implementation (7 lines of code)\n\n### 2. Related Components\n\n**Sidebar Navigation (references Settings):**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.tsx` - Main sidebar wrapper component\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/SidebarNavLinks.tsx` - Contains the Settings nav link:\n  - Settings link with path `/settings` and Settings icon from lucide-react\n  - testId: `nav-link-settings`\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/Sidebar/SidebarUserArea.tsx` - User authentication area\n\n**App Router:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/App.tsx` - Route definition for `/settings` element\n\n### 3. Playwright Test Files\n\n**Settings navigation tests:**\n- `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/tests/sidebar-nav.spec.ts` - Contains comprehensive tests for Settings:\n  - \"Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons\" - verifies Settings link exists\n  - \"Clicking Settings link navigates to /settings\" - tests navigation and active state highlighting\n  - \"Active link highlights based on current route\" - tests Settings link highlighting behavior\n  - \"Sidebar is persistent across all pages\" - includes Settings as one of the 6 pages tested\n\n### 4. AppSpec.md Documentation\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppSpec.md` (76 lines)\n- Does NOT contain a detailed Settings page specification yet\n- Lists pages 1-6 (Clients, Contacts, Persons, Deals, Tasks)\n- SettingsPage not documented with requirements\n\n### 5. Test Documentation\n\n**File:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (609 lines)\n- Line 38-41: Documents \"Clicking Settings link navigates to /settings\" test case\n- Line 598: Section header \"## SettingsPage (/settings)\" exists but no specifications defined yet\n- Settings is recognized as a required page but specifications are placeholder-only\n\n### 6.

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match.

Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4e7eed48-bc5e-4429-b901-30a32fbada40","uuid":"7096fa4e-a432-456c-b04a-48c59cc99a8a","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

Let me check each job systematically:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecSettings - Check testSpec.md directive violations in SettingsPage test entries\n\nThe SettingsPage section in docs/tests.md is currently empty (line 598: `## SettingsPage (/settings)` with no test entries below it).\n\nThe AppRevisions.md describes the Settings page in detail (lines 57-66):\n- Email Notifications section\n- Import & Export section\n- Webhooks section with CRUD\n- Webhook setup guides\n\nThe testSpec.md directives say:\n1. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n\n\n2. Don't cut corners by testing easier elements instead of what's actually shown.\n3. Every clickable element needs its exact navigation target or action result specified.\n4. Data mutations require test entries confirming persistence and all side effects.\n5. Visual styling of buttons and controls matters.\n6. Modal dialogs need complete functional testing.\n7. Import and upload dialogs must document the expected data format.\n8. External integrations like webhooks and OAuth need full setup instructions visible in the UI for each service.\n9. State management and persistence need verification.\n\nI'm noticing the SettingsPage section in the test documentation is completely empty—there are no test entries despite the app documentation describing substantial features like email notifications, import/export, and webhooks with setup guides. This is a violation of the testing directives since every visible element should have corresponding test coverage. The strategy requires checking all documentation for violations, and an empty section where functionality exists is itself a violation.\n\nNow I need to verify whether the Settings page components have actually been implemented in the codebase or if they're still just planned features.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2361,"cache_read_input_tokens":50963,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2361,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4e7eed48-bc5e-4429-b901-30a32fbada40","uuid":"b7a7127e-0fec-4465-8532-eba56f326020"}

The `docs/tests.md` has an empty section for SettingsPage, and there are no test files for it.\n\nNow let me systematically check each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecSettings\n\nThe SettingsPage section in docs/tests.md (line 598) is completely empty. According to AppRevisions.md, the Settings page should have:\n1. Email Notifications section with 7 toggles\n2. Import & Export section with import/export buttons\n3. Webhooks section with CRUD, add/edit modal, enable/disable toggle, delete with confirmation\n\n\n4. Webhook setup guides with platform-specific instructions\n\nThe testSpec.md directives require systematically inventorying every visible element, writing test entries for each one, testing modal dialogs completely, and including backend integrations with setup instructions. For state-changing actions, I need to verify side effects. The SettingsPage violates this entirely—there are no test entries despite the significant functionality described in AppRevisions.md.\n\n## Job 2: CheckComponentsSettings\n\nThe writeApp.md directives require components to include data-testid attributes on interactive elements and all JSX to be abstracted into separate React component files. The SettingsPage needs to match the visual appearance specified in the requirements, but currently it's missing all of this structure.\n\nChecking SettingsPage.tsx, I see it's just a stub with a heading and the correct data-testid and padding attributes, but there's no actual implementation of the Email Notifications, Import & Export, or Webhooks sections that should be there.\n\n## Job 3: CheckTestsSettings\n\nThe writeTests.md directives require Playwright tests for all test entries and tests that verify navigation targets precisely. I need to check what tests exist and whether they're covering the functionality that should be implemented.\n\nThere's no test file for SettingsPage at all, which means there are no Playwright tests covering any of its functionality.\n\nThe core issue is that SettingsPage hasn't been fully built out yet. The AppRevisions.md describes three major sections with setup guides, but the component is just a stub, there are no test entries documented, and no Playwright tests exist. I need to create fix groups that address all three gaps, starting with writing the test entries and then implementing the actual component functionality.\n\nBut I should reconsider what counts as a violation here. The strategy says to check for violations of directives in what EXISTS, not to flag missing features. If the test section is empty, there's technically nothing there to violate the directives about inventorying elements. The real question is whether the absence of test entries itself violates the directive that test entries should exist for every page.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, the SettingsPage is clearly defined in AppRevisions.md, and there's a section header in docs/tests.md that was started but never completed. This incomplete section suggests someone acknowledged the need but didn't follow through, which does feel like a directive violation—the directive to systematically inventory every element hasn't been fulfilled for a page that definitely exists in the specification.\n\nThe root cause here is straightforward: SettingsPage hasn't been fully built out. The fix would naturally follow the standard pipeline—first documenting the test specs, then implementing the components, then writing the Playwright tests. These should probably be grouped together since they're all addressing the same incomplete feature, but I need to think through whether the fix group strategy actually calls for that or if they should be separate violations tied to their respective directives. I see there are three related violations for the SettingsPage that need to be fixed in sequence: missing test entries in the docs, a stub component with no implementation, and absent Playwright tests. Since they're all interconnected and stem from the same root cause, I should group them together but ensure they're tackled in the right order. Let me work through each checking job systematically, starting with verifying what test entries should exist according to the AppRevisions documentation.\n\nThe SettingsPage needs comprehensive test coverage across multiple sections—Notifications with its toggleable preferences, Import & Export functionality, Webhooks with full CRUD operations and modals, plus setup guides for different platforms. Looking at the testSpec directives, there are clear gaps: no test entries exist for any of these elements, no specifications for the clickable toggles and buttons, the webhook modal isn't documented, and the backend integration setup instructions aren't visible in the tests.\n\nBeyond testing, the writeApp directives reveal the component itself is just a stub—it lacks actual implementation, has no sub-components abstracted out, and is missing data-testid attributes on interactive elements.\n\nFor the Playwright tests, there's nothing to test since no test file exists for SettingsPage, which violates the requirement that tests must match their corresponding test entries.\n\nLooking at the fix strategy, I need to sequence these properly: test entries should come first, then the component implementation, then the Playwright tests, since each layer depends on the previous one. I'm realizing these tasks are quite substantial, so maybe I should lean on the existing build strategies instead. The testSpec, writeApp, and writeTests approaches already break things down into manageable sub-groups, so I could structure the fix groups to invoke those strategies directly rather than trying to define everything upfront.\n\nLooking back at the fix group pattern, it's meant for simpler violations—I should use checkDirectives.md as the strategy and keep each group focused. For the SettingsPage work, I think the right split is: first fix the missing test entries in the docs, then implement the actual components. the SettingsPage component with all three sections and their backend integrations, then write comprehensive Playwright tests to verify everything works, and finally run the test suite to confirm all tests
