Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — write a test entry for each one\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows\n4. For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result\n5. For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying change is persisted and side effects occur (exactly one, no duplicates)\n6. Button and control appearance matters — test entry should verify appearance\n7. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions visible in configuration UI\n11. State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update appropriately\n\nNow let me systematically go through each SupplierDetailsPage test entry section by section.\n\n## Checking SupplierDetailsPage test entries in tests.md\n\nThe SupplierDetailsPage section starts at line 336 and covers these subsections:\n- SectionTabLinks (lines 342-363)\n- SupplierOverview (lines 364-413)\n- DocumentsTab (lines 424-473)\n- CommentsSection (lines 475-514)\n- OrdersSection (lines 516-597)\n\nLet me check each one systematically.\n\n### Checking: SectionTabLinks (lines 342-363)\n\nEntries:\n- **Display Section Tab Links** - Tests presence of three tab link buttons. ✅ Specifies exact text.\n- **Click Documents Tab Scrolls to Documents Section** - ✅ Specifies action result (scrolls to Documents).\n- **Click Comments Tab Scrolls to Comments Section** - ✅ Specifies action result.\n- **Click Orders Tab Scrolls to Orders Section** - ✅ Specifies action result.\n\nNo violations found in SectionTabLinks.\n\n### Checking: SupplierOverview (lines 364-413)\n\nEntries:\n- **Display Supplier Name** - ✅ Tests display of heading \"Supplier Overview\" and label/value.\n- **Display Supplier Address** - ✅ Tests multi-line address display.\n- **Display Contact Information** - ✅ Tests contact name, phone, email.\n- **Display Supplier Description** - ✅ Tests description text.\n- **Display Status Badge** - ✅ Tests color-coded badges for all statuses.\n- **Back to Dashboard Button Navigates to Dashboard** - ✅ Specifies exact navigation target /.\n- **Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog** - ✅ Tests modal opens pre-filled, saves changes, persists.\n- **Edit Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Modify Supplier** - ✅ Tests cancel behavior.\n- **Edit Supplier Dialog Validation** - ✅ Tests validation on Supplier Name field.\n- **Delete Supplier with Confirmation** - ✅ Tests confirmation dialog, deletion, navigation to /, removal from SuppliersList.\n\nChecking directive 5 (mutation side effects): The Edit Supplier entry tests persistence.

No violations found.\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 2: CheckComponentsSupplierDetailsPage\n\nNow I need to check all SupplierDetailsPage components against **writeApp.md directives**:\n\n1. Run `npm run check` from app directory, not standalone tsc\n2. When working on a component, identify test entries and ensure requirements are satisfied\n3. Match visual appearance of elements to the mockup\n4. All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items\n5. In monorepo, add `base = \"apps/SupplierTracker\"` to `netlify.toml`\n6. Use tagged template literal syntax for neon queries\n7. Convert empty strings to null for DATE/TIMESTAMP/UUID columns\n8. Netlify Functions path index: resource ID at index 3\n9. Use searchable select/dropdown for entity references in modals\n10. No duplicate navigation links\n11. Never use native HTML `<select>` for filter/dropdown controls\n12. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons\n13. Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads\n14.

NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait inside `.toPass()` that iterates dynamic elements\n8. No unnecessary state cleanup in `beforeEach`\n9. Use generous timeouts for backend round-trips\n10. Use `test.slow()` for multi-step e2e flows\n11. Skill files at `/repo/skills/tasks/`\n12.

All other colors use CSS variables. ✓\n\n5. **All JSX abstracted into components with their own files** (guideline): All sub-components are in separate files. ✓\n\n6. **No duplicate navigation links** (directive 9): N/A for modal dialog. ✓\n\n7. **Searchable select for entity references** (directive 8): Account filtering uses checkbox tree, not plain text input. ✓\n\n8. **Page padding** (directive 14): Not applicable - this is a modal, not a page. ✓\n\n9. **Components layout-agnostic** (tip): Components don't include outer padding. ✓\n\n**No writeApp.md directive violations found in CreateReportDialog components.**\n\nNow let me proceed to subtask 3: checking writeTests.md directives in CreateReportDialog tests.\n[TodoWrite]\n[glob] apps/Accounting/tests/**/create-report*\n[glob] apps/Accounting/tests/**/*report*\n[glob] apps/Accounting/tests/**/*\n[glob] apps/Accounting/**/*.spec.ts\n[glob] apps/Accounting/**/*.test.ts\n[grep] CreateReportDialog|create-report|report-dialog\nLet me read the relevant test sections that reference CreateReportDialog.\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/accounts-page.spec.ts\n[read] /repo/apps/Accounting/tests/account-detail-page.spec.ts\n## Subtask 3: CheckTestsCreateReportDialog\n\nThere is **no dedicated CreateReportDialog test file** (`create-report-dialog.spec.ts` does not exist). The 63 test entries for CreateReportDialog in docs/tests.md have not yet been turned into Playwright tests.\n\nThe only existing test code referencing CreateReportDialog is in other pages' test files:\n- `accounts-page.spec.ts:141-155` - tests opening the dialog from AccountsPage\n- `account-detail-page.spec.ts:451-473` - tests opening the dialog from AccountDetailPage\n\n**Checking these existing tests against writeTests.md directives:**\n\n1. **Precise navigation targets** (directive 1): Tests verify `create-report-dialog` visibility and report type pre-selection via class matching. ✓\n2. **Use `getByTestId` not `getByText`** (directive 4): All selectors use `getByTestId`. ✓\n3. **Consistent `data-testid` values** (directive 5): Values match component source (`create-report-dialog`, `report-type-budget_vs_actual`, `report-type-detailed`). ✓\n4. **Generous timeouts** (directive 9): Uses `{ timeout: 10000 }` for dialog, `{ timeout: 30000 }` for initial page loads. ✓\n5. **No `.toPass()` deadlock patterns** (directive 7): No `.toPass()` blocks used. ✓\n6. **No unnecessary cleanup** (directive 8): No redundant cleanup. ✓\n\n**No writeTests.md directive violations found** in the existing test code referencing CreateReportDialog. (The absence of a dedicated test file is a missing implementation, not a directive violation.)\n[TodoWrite]\nAll three subtasks are complete. Here's a summary of findings:\n\n**Subtask 1 (testSpec.md directives):** Found 3 violations - ambiguous \"may\" language in test entries at lines 608 and 879-881, and a missing test for Detailed Transactions pre-selection from AccountDetailPage. A fix task has been added to the queue.\n\n**Subtask 2 (writeApp.md directives):** No violations found. All components have proper `data-testid` attributes, use CSS variables for colors, don't use native `<select>` elements, and are properly abstracted into separate files.\n\n**Subtask 3 (writeTests.md directives):** No violations found in existing test code. The CreateReportDialog page doesn't have a dedicated test file yet, but existing cross-references from other test files are directive-compliant.\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 467274ms | Turns: 47 | Cost: $1.9136\nCost: $1.9136 (total: $11.7314)\nTurns: 47\nTask signaled <DONE>.

Now let me start **Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecDashboardPage**. I need to check the testSpec.md directives against the DashboardPage test entries in docs/tests.md. Let me re-review the directives from testSpec.md and systematically check each DashboardPage entry.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images of different pages - prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\n4. For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\n5. For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects (history/timeline entries, no duplicates).\n6. Button and control appearance matters.\n7. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions.\n11. State-changing actions must have tests that verify other parts of the app update.\n\nLet me look at the AppSpec to compare with the test entries.\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/AppSpec.md\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/AppRevisions.md\n[read] /repo/apps/SupplierTracker/AppSpec.md\nLet me download and examine the DashboardPage mockup to compare against the test entries.\n$ curl -L -o /tmp/dashboard-mockup.png \"https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5wMORO0tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7\" 2>&1 | tail -5\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n\r  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0\r  0 2190k    0 16384    0     0  23059      0  0:01:37 --:--:--  0:01:37 23043\r100 2190k  100 2190k    0     0  2035k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 2037k\n[read] /tmp/dashboard-mockup.png\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecDashboardPage\n\nSystematically checking each DashboardPage test entry section against testSpec.md directives.\n\n### Checking QuickActions section (8 entries)\n\n**Entries checked:**\n- \"Display Quick Actions Heading\" - heading verified ✅\n- \"Display Add New Supplier Button\" - specifies icon (person-plus) and position (left side) ✅\n- \"Display Create Purchase Order Button\" - specifies icon (document) and position (right side) ✅\n- \"Add New Supplier Button Opens Create Supplier Dialog\" - specifies all fields, default value for Status ✅\n- \"Create Supplier via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" - verifies persistence in SuppliersList with specific data ✅\n- \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\" - tests cancel behavior ✅\n- \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" - tests required field validation ✅\n- \"Create Purchase Order Button Opens Create Order Dialog\" - specifies all fields including line items section, defaults ✅\n- \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" - verifies persistence AND side effect (OrderHistory entry \"appearing exactly once\") ✅\n- \"Create Order Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Order\" - tests cancel ✅\n- \"Create Order Dialog Validation\" - tests required field validation ✅\n\n**Directive checks:**\n- Every clickable element has exact action result specified ✅\n- Modal dialogs completely tested (open, save, cancel, validation) ✅\n- Mutating actions verify persistence and side effects (history entry exactly once) ✅\n- Button appearance (icons, positioning) tested ✅\n\n### Checking UpcomingOrdersTable section (13 entries)\n\n**Entries checked:**\n- \"Display Upcoming Orders Heading\" ✅\n- \"Display Table with Correct Columns\" - all 5 columns from mockup listed ✅\n- \"Display Order Data Rows\" - 5 rows with full data ✅\n- \"Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details\" - exact URL `/orders/PO-2023-001` ✅\n- \"Order ID Links Are Styled as Clickable\" - blue underlined styling ✅\n- \"Status Badges with Correct Colors\" - In Transit=blue/teal, Pending=yellow, Fulfilled=green ✅\n- \"Filter by Status Dropdown\" - filter and clear behavior ✅\n- \"Filter by Supplier Dropdown\" - filter and clear behavior ✅\n- \"Both Filters Applied Together\" - combined filter behavior ✅\n- \"Empty State When No Orders Match Filters\" - empty message ✅\n- \"Empty State When No Upcoming Orders Exist\" - empty message ✅\n- \"Currency Formatting in Total Cost Column\" - dollar sign, commas, 2 decimals ✅\n- \"Date Formatting in Expected Delivery Column\" - MMM DD, YYYY format ✅\n\n**Directive checks:**\n- All columns from mockup inventoried ✅\n- Both filter controls tested (mockup shows two) ✅\n- Navigation targets exact ✅\n- Badge styling verified ✅\n\n### Checking SuppliersList section (11 entries)\n\n**Entries checked:**\n- \"Display Suppliers List Heading\" ✅\n- \"Display Supplier Cards in Grid Layout\" - up to 4 cards per row (matches mockup) ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Supplier Name\" - bold, top-left ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Status Badge\" - top-right, color-coded (Active=green, On Hold=yellow) ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Contact Name\" ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Contact Email\" ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Orders Summary\" - \"3 Open Orders, $12k Value\" ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Shows All Fields Together\" - full card layout verified ✅\n- \"Clicking Supplier Card Navigates to Supplier Details\" - exact URL `/suppliers/<supplierId>` ✅\n- \"Multiple Supplier Cards Displayed\" - all 8 cards listed ✅\n- \"Empty State When No Suppliers Exist\" ✅\n\n**Directive checks:**\n- All visible elements from mockup inventoried ✅\n- Card layout matches mockup exactly (name bold top-left, badge top-right, contact, email, summary) ✅\n- Clickable elements have exact navigation targets ✅\n- No substitution of simpler elements ✅\n\n### Summary for Subtask 1: No directive violations found\n\nAll DashboardPage test entries follow testSpec.md directives.

Now let me start **Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecDashboardPage**. I need to check the testSpec.md directives against the DashboardPage test entries in docs/tests.md. Let me re-review the directives from testSpec.md and systematically check each DashboardPage entry.\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n1. Images of different pages - prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n3. Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows.\n4. For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.\n5. For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects (history/timeline entries, no duplicates).\n6. Button and control appearance matters.\n7. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads.\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format.\n10. Backend integrations must include setup instructions.\n11. State-changing actions must have tests that verify other parts of the app update.\n\nLet me look at the AppSpec to compare with the test entries.\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/AppSpec.md\n[glob] apps/SupplierTracker/AppRevisions.md\n[read] /repo/apps/SupplierTracker/AppSpec.md\nLet me download and examine the DashboardPage mockup to compare against the test entries.\n$ curl -L -o /tmp/dashboard-mockup.png \"https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5wMORO0tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7\" 2>&1 | tail -5\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n\r  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0\r  0 2190k    0 16384    0     0  23059      0  0:01:37 --:--:--  0:01:37 23043\r100 2190k  100 2190k    0     0  2035k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 2037k\n[read] /tmp/dashboard-mockup.png\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecDashboardPage\n\nSystematically checking each DashboardPage test entry section against testSpec.md directives.\n\n### Checking QuickActions section (8 entries)\n\n**Entries checked:**\n- \"Display Quick Actions Heading\" - heading verified ✅\n- \"Display Add New Supplier Button\" - specifies icon (person-plus) and position (left side) ✅\n- \"Display Create Purchase Order Button\" - specifies icon (document) and position (right side) ✅\n- \"Add New Supplier Button Opens Create Supplier Dialog\" - specifies all fields, default value for Status ✅\n- \"Create Supplier via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" - verifies persistence in SuppliersList with specific data ✅\n- \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\" - tests cancel behavior ✅\n- \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" - tests required field validation ✅\n- \"Create Purchase Order Button Opens Create Order Dialog\" - specifies all fields including line items section, defaults ✅\n- \"Create Order via Dialog Saves and Updates Dashboard\" - verifies persistence AND side effect (OrderHistory entry \"appearing exactly once\") ✅\n- \"Create Order Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Order\" - tests cancel ✅\n- \"Create Order Dialog Validation\" - tests required field validation ✅\n\n**Directive checks:**\n- Every clickable element has exact action result specified ✅\n- Modal dialogs completely tested (open, save, cancel, validation) ✅\n- Mutating actions verify persistence and side effects (history entry exactly once) ✅\n- Button appearance (icons, positioning) tested ✅\n\n### Checking UpcomingOrdersTable section (13 entries)\n\n**Entries checked:**\n- \"Display Upcoming Orders Heading\" ✅\n- \"Display Table with Correct Columns\" - all 5 columns from mockup listed ✅\n- \"Display Order Data Rows\" - 5 rows with full data ✅\n- \"Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details\" - exact URL `/orders/PO-2023-001` ✅\n- \"Order ID Links Are Styled as Clickable\" - blue underlined styling ✅\n- \"Status Badges with Correct Colors\" - In Transit=blue/teal, Pending=yellow, Fulfilled=green ✅\n- \"Filter by Status Dropdown\" - filter and clear behavior ✅\n- \"Filter by Supplier Dropdown\" - filter and clear behavior ✅\n- \"Both Filters Applied Together\" - combined filter behavior ✅\n- \"Empty State When No Orders Match Filters\" - empty message ✅\n- \"Empty State When No Upcoming Orders Exist\" - empty message ✅\n- \"Currency Formatting in Total Cost Column\" - dollar sign, commas, 2 decimals ✅\n- \"Date Formatting in Expected Delivery Column\" - MMM DD, YYYY format ✅\n\n**Directive checks:**\n- All columns from mockup inventoried ✅\n- Both filter controls tested (mockup shows two) ✅\n- Navigation targets exact ✅\n- Badge styling verified ✅\n\n### Checking SuppliersList section (11 entries)\n\n**Entries checked:**\n- \"Display Suppliers List Heading\" ✅\n- \"Display Supplier Cards in Grid Layout\" - up to 4 cards per row (matches mockup) ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Supplier Name\" - bold, top-left ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Status Badge\" - top-right, color-coded (Active=green, On Hold=yellow) ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Contact Name\" ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Contact Email\" ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Displays Orders Summary\" - \"3 Open Orders, $12k Value\" ✅\n- \"Supplier Card Shows All Fields Together\" - full card layout verified ✅\n- \"Clicking Supplier Card Navigates to Supplier Details\" - exact URL `/suppliers/<supplierId>` ✅\n- \"Multiple Supplier Cards Displayed\" - all 8 cards listed ✅\n- \"Empty State When No Suppliers Exist\" ✅\n\n**Directive checks:**\n- All visible elements from mockup inventoried ✅\n- Card layout matches mockup exactly (name bold top-left, badge top-right, contact, email, summary) ✅\n- Clickable elements have exact navigation targets ✅\n- No substitution of simpler elements ✅\n\n### Summary for Subtask 1: No directive violations found\n\nAll DashboardPage test entries follow testSpec.md directives.

Let me systematically work through each subtask and document my findings.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecNavigation\n\nChecking all Navigation test entries in `docs/tests.md` against testSpec.md directives:\n\n### TopNavBar entries (13 entries):\n\n1. **Display App Logo with Icon and Name** - Describes appearance (icon + text). Specifies exact visual elements. ✓\n2. **Click App Logo Navigates to Dashboard** - Specifies exact navigation target (`/`). ✓\n3. **Display Dashboard Nav Link** - Tests element visibility. ✓\n4. **Click Dashboard Nav Link Navigates to Dashboard** - Specifies exact target (`/`). ✓\n5. **Display Suppliers Nav Link** - ✓\n6. **Click Suppliers Nav Link Scrolls to Suppliers Section** - Specifies action result. ✓\n7. **Display Orders Nav Link** - ✓\n8. **Click Orders Nav Link Scrolls to Orders Section** - ✓\n9. **Display Inventory Nav Link** - ✓\n10. **Click Inventory Nav Link Scrolls to Inventory Section** - ✓\n11. **Active Nav Link Highlights Current Page** - Tests styling/appearance for Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders. ✓\n12. **Display User Profile Button** - Describes appearance (avatar \"U\", chevron). ✓\n13. **Nav Bar Consistent Across All Pages** - Tests cross-page consistency. ✓\n\n### Breadcrumbs entries (8 entries):\n\nChecking SupplierDetailsPage breadcrumb entries:\n1. **Display Breadcrumbs on SupplierDetailsPage** - Shows \"Home > Suppliers > Apex Global Logistics > Supplier Details\". ✓\n2. **SupplierDetailsPage Breadcrumb Home Navigates to Dashboard** - Exact target `/`. ✓\n3. **SupplierDetailsPage Breadcrumb Suppliers Navigates to Dashboard** - Exact target `/`. ✓\n4. **SupplierDetailsPage Breadcrumb Supplier Name and Supplier Details Are Not Clickable** - ✓\n\nChecking OrderDetailsPage breadcrumb entries:\n5. **Display Breadcrumbs on OrderDetailsPage** - Shows \"Dashboard > Orders > Order #PO-2024-10-1234\". ✓\n6. **OrderDetailsPage Breadcrumb Dashboard Navigates to Dashboard** - Exact target `/`. ✓\n7. **OrderDetailsPage Breadcrumb Orders Navigates to Dashboard** - Exact target `/`. ✓\n8. **OrderDetailsPage Breadcrumb Order ID Is Not Clickable** - ✓\n\n### VIOLATION FOUND - Inconsistent breadcrumb root label\n\nThe SupplierDetailsPage breadcrumb uses **\"Home\"** as the first segment while the OrderDetailsPage uses **\"Dashboard\"**. Both navigate to `/`. This violates the testSpec.md directive: *\"Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other... (truncated)\n\nThe TopNavBar's first link is \"Dashboard\" → `/`, so \"Dashboard\" should be the consistent label across both pages.\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 2: CheckComponentsNavigation\n\nChecking Navigation components against writeApp.md directives:\n\n### TopNavBar.tsx (`/repo/apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/TopNavBar.tsx`)\n\n1. **data-testid attributes**: ✓ Has `top-nav`, `top-nav-logo`, `top-nav-links`, `top-nav-${item.key}`, `top-nav-user`\n2. **No duplicate navigation links**: ✓ All 4 links have unique routes (`/`, `/#suppliers`, `/#orders`, `/#inventory`)\n3. **No native HTML `<select>` elements**: ✓ No select elements\n4. **Layout-agnostic components**: ✓ Nav bar is a layout element itself, appropriate\n5. **Consistent page padding**: N/A (not a page component)\n6. **JSX comments next to interactive elements**: **VIOLATION** - No JSX comments referencing test titles next to any interactive element:\n   - Logo link (line 25): No comment\n   - Nav link items (lines 53-75): No comment\n   - User profile button (line 80): No comment\n\n### Breadcrumb.tsx (`/repo/apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.tsx`)\n\n7. **data-testid attributes**: Has `breadcrumb` on root container, but individual breadcrumb links (interactive elements) lack data-testid attributes. **VIOLATION** - E2E tests need to target individual breadcrumb items.\n8. **Rendering non-clickable items**: **VIOLATION** - The component only renders the LAST item as plain text (`<span>`). Items without `onClick` that aren't last are still rendered as `<a>` tags. In SupplierDetailsPage, the supplier name breadcrumb item `{ label: supplier.name }` (index 2 of 4) has ... (truncated)\n\n### SupplierDetailsPage.tsx (breadcrumb usage, lines 74-79)\n\n9. **Breadcrumb root label**: Uses \"Home\" instead of \"Dashboard\" (inconsistency flagged in Subtask 1)\n\n### OrderDetailsPage.tsx (breadcrumb usage, lines 73-77)\n\n10. **Breadcrumb implementation**: ✓ Correct usage with \"Dashboard\" label\n\n### Violations summary for components:\n- **TopNavBar missing JSX comments** \n- **Breadcrumb renders non-clickable items as links** (shared component bug)\n- **Breadcrumb items missing individual data-testid attributes** (shared component)\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 3: CheckTestsNavigation\n\nChecking Navigation test files against writeTests.md directives:\n\n### supplier-details-tab-links.spec.ts (only existing Navigation test file)\n\n1. **Verifies navigation targets precisely**: ✓ Uses `toBeInViewport()` to verify scroll targets\n2. **Avoids `getByText()` with common words**: ✓ Uses `getByTestId` throughout\n3. **Consistent data-testid values**: ✓ Uses testids matching component code\n4. **No unnecessary state cleanup**: ✓ No beforeEach hooks\n5. **Generous timeouts**: ✓ Uses `{ timeout: 30000 }` for navigation, `{ timeout: 10000 }` for visibility, `{ timeout: 5000 }` for viewport checks\n6. **No locator auto-wait inside `.toPass()`**: ✓ No `.toPass()` usage\n7. **Component tested on each page it appears on**: N/A (tabs only appear on SupplierDetailsPage)\n\n**No violations found** in the existing Navigation test file.\n\n**Note**: Tests for TopNavBar (13 test entries) and Breadcrumbs (8 test entries) have not been written yet. These are missing tests rather than directive violations in existing tests.\n\nNow let me add fix tasks for the violations found.\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\" --app \"SupplierTracker\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixViolationBreadcrumbConsistency: Fix inconsistent breadcrumb root label - SupplierDetailsPage uses 'Home' while OrderDetailsPage uses 'Dashboard' for the first breadcrumb.

(truncated)\n  - RunTests: Verify tests pass after fix\nQueue now has 14 task(s).\n[TodoWrite]\nAll three subtasks are complete. Here's a summary of violations found and fix tasks added:\n\n### Violations Found\n\n**testSpec.md violations:**\n1. **Inconsistent breadcrumb root label** — SupplierDetailsPage uses \"Home\" while OrderDetailsPage uses \"Dashboard\". Both navigate to `/`.\n\n**writeApp.md violations:**\n1. **Missing JSX comments in TopNavBar.tsx** — No JSX comments next to interactive elements (logo, nav links, user button) referencing test titles.\n2. **Breadcrumb renders non-clickable items as links** — Shared `Breadcrumb.tsx` only makes the last item plain text; items without `onClick` at non-last positions render as `<a>` tags (e.g., supplier name).\n3. **Breadcrumb items missing individual data-testid attributes** — E2E tests need to target individual breadcrumb links.\n\n**writeTests.md violations:**\n- No violations in existing test file (`supplier-details-tab-links.spec.ts`). Tests for TopNavBar and Breadcrumbs are not yet written.\n\n### Fix Tasks Added (3 tasks)\n1. `FixViolationBreadcrumbNonClickableItems` + `RunTests` — Fix shared Breadcrumb component\n2. `FixViolationTopNavBarJSXComments` — Add JSX comments to TopNavBar\n3. `FixViolationBreadcrumbConsistency` + `RunTests` — Fix inconsistent \"Home\" vs \"Dashboard\"\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 364922ms | Turns: 30 | Cost: $1.3460\nCost: $1.3460 (total: $147.4132)\nTurns: 30\nTask signaled <DONE>.

Specifies exact visual elements. ✓\n2. **Click App Logo Navigates to Dashboard** - Specifies exact navigation target (`/`). ✓\n3. **Display Dashboard Nav Link** - Tests element visibility. ✓\n4. **Click Dashboard Nav Link Navigates to Dashboard** - Specifies exact target (`/`). ✓\n5. **Display Suppliers Nav Link** - ✓\n6. **Click Suppliers Nav Link Scrolls to Suppliers Section** - Specifies action result. ✓\n7. **Display Orders Nav Link** - ✓\n8. **Click Orders Nav Link Scrolls to Orders Section** - ✓\n9. **Display Inventory Nav Link** - ✓\n10. **Click Inventory Nav Link Scrolls to Inventory Section** - ✓\n11. **Active Nav Link Highlights Current Page** - Tests styling/appearance for Dashboard, Suppliers, Orders. ✓\n12. **Display User Profile Button** - Describes appearance (avatar \"U\", chevron). ✓\n13. **Nav Bar Consistent Across All Pages** - Tests cross-page consistency. ✓\n\n### Breadcrumbs entries (8 entries):\n\nChecking SupplierDetailsPage breadcrumb entries:\n1. **Display Breadcrumbs on SupplierDetailsPage** - Shows \"Home > Suppliers > Apex Global Logistics > Supplier Details\". ✓\n2. **SupplierDetailsPage Breadcrumb Home Navigates to Dashboard** - Exact target `/`. ✓\n3. **SupplierDetailsPage Breadcrumb Suppliers Navigates to Dashboard** - Exact target `/`. ✓\n4. **SupplierDetailsPage Breadcrumb Supplier Name and Supplier Details Are Not Clickable** - ✓\n\nChecking OrderDetailsPage breadcrumb entries:\n5. **Display Breadcrumbs on OrderDetailsPage** - Shows \"Dashboard > Orders > Order #PO-2024-10-1234\". ✓\n6. **OrderDetailsPage Breadcrumb Dashboard Navigates to Dashboard** - Exact target `/`. ✓\n7. **OrderDetailsPage Breadcrumb Orders Navigates to Dashboard** - Exact target `/`. ✓\n8. **OrderDetailsPage Breadcrumb Order ID Is Not Clickable** - ✓\n\n### VIOLATION FOUND - Inconsistent breadcrumb root label\n\nThe SupplierDetailsPage breadcrumb uses **\"Home\"** as the first segment while the OrderDetailsPage uses **\"Dashboard\"**. Both navigate to `/`. This violates the testSpec.md directive: *\"Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other... (truncated)\n\nThe TopNavBar's first link is \"Dashboard\" → `/`, so \"Dashboard\" should be the consistent label across both pages.\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 2: CheckComponentsNavigation\n\nChecking Navigation components against writeApp.md directives:\n\n### TopNavBar.tsx (`/repo/apps/SupplierTracker/src/components/TopNavBar.tsx`)\n\n1. **data-testid attributes**: ✓ Has `top-nav`, `top-nav-logo`, `top-nav-links`, `top-nav-${item.key}`, `top-nav-user`\n2. **No duplicate navigation links**: ✓ All 4 links have unique routes (`/`, `/#suppliers`, `/#orders`, `/#inventory`)\n3. **No native HTML `<select>` elements**: ✓ No select elements\n4. **Layout-agnostic components**: ✓ Nav bar is a layout element itself, appropriate\n5. **Consistent page padding**: N/A (not a page component)\n6. **JSX comments next to interactive elements**: **VIOLATION** - No JSX comments referencing test titles next to any interactive element:\n   - Logo link (line 25): No comment\n   - Nav link items (lines 53-75): No comment\n   - User profile button (line 80): No comment\n\n### Breadcrumb.tsx (`/repo/apps/shared/components/Breadcrumb.tsx`)\n\n7. **data-testid attributes**: Has `breadcrumb` on root container, but individual breadcrumb links (interactive elements) lack data-testid attributes. **VIOLATION** - E2E tests need to target individual breadcrumb items.\n8. **Rendering non-clickable items**: **VIOLATION** - The component only renders the LAST item as plain text (`<span>`). Items without `onClick` that aren't last are still rendered as `<a>` tags. In SupplierDetailsPage, the supplier name breadcrumb item `{ label: supplier.name }` (index 2 of 4) has ... (truncated)\n\n### SupplierDetailsPage.tsx (breadcrumb usage, lines 74-79)\n\n9. **Breadcrumb root label**: Uses \"Home\" instead of \"Dashboard\" (inconsistency flagged in Subtask 1)\n\n### OrderDetailsPage.tsx (breadcrumb usage, lines 73-77)\n\n10. **Breadcrumb implementation**: ✓ Correct usage with \"Dashboard\" label\n\n### Violations summary for components:\n- **TopNavBar missing JSX comments** \n- **Breadcrumb renders non-clickable items as links** (shared component bug)\n- **Breadcrumb items missing individual data-testid attributes** (shared component)\n[TodoWrite]\n## Subtask 3: CheckTestsNavigation\n\nChecking Navigation test files against writeTests.md directives:\n\n### supplier-details-tab-links.spec.ts (only existing Navigation test file)\n\n1. **Verifies navigation targets precisely**: ✓ Uses `toBeInViewport()` to verify scroll targets\n2. **Avoids `getByText()` with common words**: ✓ Uses `getByTestId` throughout\n3. **Consistent data-testid values**: ✓ Uses testids matching component code\n4. **No unnecessary state cleanup**: ✓ No beforeEach hooks\n5. **Generous timeouts**: ✓ Uses `{ timeout: 30000 }` for navigation, `{ timeout: 10000 }` for visibility, `{ timeout: 5000 }` for viewport checks\n6. **No locator auto-wait inside `.toPass()`**: ✓ No `.toPass()` usage\n7. **Component tested on each page it appears on**: N/A (tabs only appear on SupplierDetailsPage)\n\n**No violations found** in the existing Navigation test file.\n\n**Note**: Tests for TopNavBar (13 test entries) and Breadcrumbs (8 test entries) have not been written yet. These are missing tests rather than directive violations in existing tests.\n\nNow let me add fix tasks for the violations found.\n$ npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\" --app \"SupplierTracker\" \\\n  --subtask \"FixViolationBreadcrumbConsistency: Fix inconsistent breadcrumb root label - SupplierDetailsPage uses 'Home' while OrderDetailsPage uses 'Dashboard' for the first breadcrumb.

Here's a summary of violations found and fix tasks added:\n\n### Violations Found\n\n**testSpec.md violations:**\n1. **Inconsistent breadcrumb root label** — SupplierDetailsPage uses \"Home\" while OrderDetailsPage uses \"Dashboard\". Both navigate to `/`.\n\n**writeApp.md violations:**\n1. **Missing JSX comments in TopNavBar.tsx** — No JSX comments next to interactive elements (logo, nav links, user button) referencing test titles.\n2. **Breadcrumb renders non-clickable items as links** — Shared `Breadcrumb.tsx` only makes the last item plain text; items without `onClick` at non-last positions render as `<a>` tags (e.g., supplier name).\n3. **Breadcrumb items missing individual data-testid attributes** — E2E tests need to target individual breadcrumb links.\n\n**writeTests.md violations:**\n- No violations in existing test file (`supplier-details-tab-links.spec.ts`). Tests for TopNavBar and Breadcrumbs are not yet written.\n\n### Fix Tasks Added (3 tasks)\n1. `FixViolationBreadcrumbNonClickableItems` + `RunTests` — Fix shared Breadcrumb component\n2. `FixViolationTopNavBarJSXComments` — Add JSX comments to TopNavBar\n3. `FixViolationBreadcrumbConsistency` + `RunTests` — Fix inconsistent \"Home\" vs \"Dashboard\"\n\n<DONE>\n\n--- Result ---\nDuration: 364922ms | Turns: 30 | Cost: $1.3460\nCost: $1.3460 (total: $147.4132)\nTurns: 30\nTask signaled <DONE>.

Let me analyze each one and write the analysis files. Let me summarize each log:\n\n**Log 108**: SupplierTracker - Fix OrderDetailsPage layout to use two-column grid. Agent fixed the CSS layout. Tests were run but had pre-existing failures (Vite cold start timeouts and UUID format issues). No test failures related to the CSS change. No test failures to report for this log's work specifically.\n\n**Log 109**: SupplierTracker - CheckDirectives for SupplierDetailsPage (testSpec, components, tests). No violations found. No tests were run beyond reading code. No test failures.\n\n\n**Log 11**: Accounting - CheckDirectives for CreateReportDialog found 3 testSpec violations with ambiguous language and missing tests. **Log 110**: SupplierTracker - CheckDirectives for DashboardPage identified one violation for missing JSX comments. **Log 111**: SupplierTracker - Fixed the violations by adding JSX comments to three files, with typecheck passing and no tests run.\n\nNow checking Navigation in SupplierTracker and finding violations around breadcrumb inconsistencies and missing comments. Fixed the shared Breadcrumb component to make non-clickable items non-interactive, then added JSX comments to TopNavBar and standardized the \"Home\" label to \"Dashboard\" for consistency. The supplier-details-overview tests all passed after these changes.\n\nLog 116 was marked complete with no additional work needed. Looking back at log 108, those test failures were infrastructure-related timeouts and connection issues from Vite cold starts, not from the CSS modifications themselves.
