Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly.

NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating.

Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.

Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching.

The test creates the most data of any filter test (4 todos with 2 completed requiring PUT calls), pushing total API time to ~80s. Combined with page navigation (~25s), the test runs out of time before the final assertion.

TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/todo-app/playwright.config.ts`**\n- **Test timeout:** 180 seconds (recently increased from 120s per bug analysis)\n- **Action timeout:** 15 seconds\n- **Navigation timeout:** 30 seconds\n- **Test directory:** `./e2e`\n- **Ignored:** `**/deployment.spec.ts`\n- **Reporter:** Replay.io custom reporter + JSON results\n- **Browser:** Replay Chromium (2-3x slower than standard, enables recording)\n- **Web server:** `netlify dev --port 8888` (manages both frontend & functions)\n- **Workers:** Parallel (fullyParallel: true)\n- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:8888`\n\n**Test Files:**\n\n1. **`e2e/fixtures.ts`** - Custom test fixture:\n   - Adds `workerIndex` fixture\n   - Sets `test-worker` cookie per worker (for per-worker database selection)\n\n2. **`e2e/header.spec.ts`** (9 tests):\n   - App title display\n   - Input visibility and placeholder\n   - Add button visibility\n   - Add via button and Enter key\n   - Cannot add empty/whitespace todos\n   - Persistence across page reload\n   - Includes `beforeEach` cleanup (deletes all todos)\n\n3. **`e2e/todolist.spec.ts`** (150+ lines, ~12 tests):\n   - Empty state message\n   - Vertical list display\n   - Checkbox, text, delete button display\n   - Toggle completion (checked/strikethrough)\n   - Untoggle completion\n   - Persistence after reload\n   - Delete via button\n   - Deleted todos stay deleted after reload\n   - Completed styling verification\n   - Active todo styling\n\n4. **`e2e/filters.spec.ts`** (150+ lines, ~24+ tests):\n   - Filter button visibility (All, Active, Completed)\n   - All filter active by default\n   - Filter by Active (shows uncompleted only)\n   - Filter by Completed (shows completed only)\n   - Filter by All (shows all)\n   - Visual highlight of active filter\n   - Items left count (3 items, 1 item, 0 items)\n   - Count updates on complete/add/delete\n   - Completing todo hides it in Active filter\n   - Uncompleting todo hides it in Completed filter\n   - Clear completed visibility and functionality\n   - Clear completed persistence\n\n**Test Spec Document:** `/repo/apps/todo-app/docs/tests.md`\n- Comprehensive test specification with 38+ test cases\n- Organized by component (Header, TodoList, Filters)\n- Each test includes: initial state, action, expected result\n\n---\n\n### 6. KNOWN ISSUES & DOCUMENTATION\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/todo-app/docs/bugs/ClearCompletedRemovesAllCompletedTodos.md`**\n- **Issue:** Test timeout (not actual app bug)\n- **Root Cause:** 120s test timeout was too tight for infrastructure overhead:\n  - Replay Chromium is 2-3x slower\n  - Neon serverless cold connections take 5-10s each\n  - Test setup requires 8 API calls (~80s total)\n  - Combined with navigation (~25s), runs out of time\n- **Solution:** Increase test timeout from 120s to 180s (already implemented in playwright.config.ts)\n\n**File: `/repo/apps/todo-app/AppSpec.md`**\n- Complete app specification matching the built implementation\n- Pages, components, data model, API endpoints, behavior\n\n---\n\n### 7.

The task is to \"Unpack: Write the app\" - this means I should unpack the initial write app task into subtasks. But since the app is already fully built, there's nothing to actually build. Let me re-read the skill more carefully.\n\nThe skill says:\n1. First, add a setup task\n2. Then add one task per page, containing all components and the page itself\n\nBut since the app is already completely built, I think I need to just verify this and then signal done. Actually wait - the subtask says \"Unpack: Write the app\" - the \"Unpack\" prefix means I need to unpack this into subtasks. \n\nI'm realizing the core issue: my job is to unpack the task into subtasks using add-task, but the app is already built and deployed, so creating subtasks for components that already exist seems redundant. Let me check the AGENTS.md guidance again about when to signal completion - it says to output `<DONE>` when all subtasks are completed, but the subtask itself is \"Unpack: Write the app\" which requires me to create those subtasks first.\n\nThe most practical approach is to recognize that since the entire app is already written, tested, and deployed with subsequent tasks already queued, I should signal completion rather than create pointless subtasks for work that's already done. right approach. The app is already fully built with all components, pages, backend functions, database schema, etc. There's no work to be done.\n\nWait, but the AGENTS.md says: \"If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you added to the queue, you are DONE.\"\n\nAnd the critical rule: \"You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt.\"\n\nSo my assigned subtask is \"Unpack: Write the app\". The unpack step creates new tasks via add-task. But since the app already exists... \n\nLet me check if there's anything missing or that could use improvement. Looking at the exploration results:\n- All components exist: Header, TodoList, Filters\n- Page exists: TodoListPage\n- Backend exists: todos.ts\n- Schema exists: schema.ts\n- Tests exist\n- It's deployed and working\n\nSince the app is already complete, I should verify everything is functioning properly and then mark this done rather than creating unnecessary subtasks for work that's already finished. Let me run a check to confirm the code quality is solid.","signature":"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
