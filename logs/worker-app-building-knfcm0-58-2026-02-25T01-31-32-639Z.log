Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    47→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    48→\n    49→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    50→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    51→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    52→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    53→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    54→\n    55→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    56→  ```ts\n    57→  await expect(async () => {\n    58→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    59→    const count = await cards.count();\n    60→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    61→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    62→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    63→    }\n    64→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    65→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    66→  ```\n    67→\n    68→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    69→  ```ts\n    70→  await expect(\n    71→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    72→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    73→  ```\n    74→\n    75→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    76→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    77→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    78→\n    79→- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n    80→  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n    85→  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n    86→  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    97→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    98→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    99→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   100→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   101→\n   102→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   103→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   104→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   105→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   106→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   107→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   108→\n   109→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   110→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   111→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   112→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   113→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   114→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   115→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   116→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   117→\n   118→## Parallel Test Design\n   119→\n   120→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   121→Write tests with this in mind:\n   122→\n   123→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   124→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   125→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   126→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   127→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   128→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   129→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   130→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   131→  being unmodified.\n   132→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   133→  you need to interact with.\n   134→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   135→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   136→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   137→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   138→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   139→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   140→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   141→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   142→\n   143→## Tips\n   144→\n   145→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   146→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   147→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   148→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   149→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   150→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   151→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   152→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   153→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   154→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2c47f5c6-af02-4a26-9fd4-86798a345fba","uuid":"36ccb8cb-0f3b-4345-9fe9-c01b246df2ab","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n\n  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(async () => {\n    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    const count = await cards.count();\n    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    }\n    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n  ```ts\n  await expect(\n    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n  ```\n\n  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n\n- Do not add unnecessary state cleanup (e.g., `localStorage.removeItem`, `page.reload()`) in\n  `beforeEach` hooks when Playwright already provides a fresh browser context per test. Redundant\n  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n\n- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones. Environments with\n  recording overhead (Replay browser) and cold database connections (Neon DB) add significant\n  latency beyond typical local development. A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n  under load or recording.\n\n- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n\n- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":154,"startLine":1,"totalLines":154}}}

Now I have a complete picture. Let me compile a comprehensive summary report:\n\n## Summary: ProductionHub App with RUN- Test IDs\n\nI've completed a thorough exploration of the ProductionHub application structure. Here's my complete report:\n\n### 1. **Tests.md File Location**\n- **Path**: `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md`\n- **Contains**: Complete test specification for ProductionHub including RUN test entries (RUN-HDR-1 through RUN-EXT-4)\n- **Format**: Markdown with detailed test specifications using Given/When/Then format\n\n### 2. **App Directory**\n- **Location**: `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/`\n- **Type**: React/TypeScript application with Redux Toolkit state management\n- **Build System**: Vite\n- **Testing Framework**: Playwright with Replay.io integration\n- **Deployment**: Netlify Functions\n\n### 3. **Existing Test Files**\nLocated in `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/tests/`:\n- `calendar-header.spec.ts` - Tests for CAL-HDR tests\n- `calendar-grid.spec.ts` - Tests for CAL-GRID tests\n- `calendar-popup.spec.ts` - Tests for CAL-POP tests (production run popup)\n- `recipes-page.spec.ts` - Tests for REC-HDR, REC-TBL, REC-PNL tests\n\n**No existing RUN-* test files** - These need to be created.\n\n### 4. **Main Page Components and Structure**\n\n**RunDetailsPage** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/pages/RunDetailsPage.tsx`):\n- Route: `/runs/:runId`\n- Main component structure:\n\n| Section | Component | Test ID | Details |\n|---------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Header | `RunHeader` | `run-header` | Breadcrumb, title, high-level info card |\n| Actions | `RunActions` | `run-actions` | Adjust Quantities, Confirm Run, Cancel Run buttons |\n| Raw Materials | `RawMaterialsTable` | `raw-materials-section` | Materials needed for the run |\n| Forecast/Availability | `ForecastTable` | `forecast-section` | Material availability and shortages |\n| Equipment | `RunEquipmentTable` | `run-equipment-section` | Equipment required and status |\n| External Links | `ExternalAppLinks` | `external-app-links` | Links to inventory and delivery apps |\n\n### 5. **RUN Test Coverage (47 tests total)**\n\n**RUN-HDR Tests (13 tests - RunHeader Component)**\n- Breadcrumb navigation (Home, Runs, Run ID)\n- Page title display\n- High-Level Information section with fields:\n  - Run ID, Date/Time, Product, Associated Recipe, Planned Quantity, Status\n- Status badge styling (Scheduled, Confirmed, Cancelled)\n\n**RUN-ACT Tests (9 tests - RunActions Component)**\n- Adjust Quantities button and modal\n- Confirm Run button and status change\n- Cancel Run button and confirmation dialog\n- Action visibility based on run status (Scheduled, Confirmed, Cancelled)\n\n**RUN-MAT Tests (6 tests - RawMaterialsTable Component)**\n- Recipe and Raw Materials section heading\n- Table headers (Material, Amount Needed, Units)\n- Material rows with calculated amounts\n- Material amount updates when quantity changes\n- Empty state handling\n\n**RUN-FCST Tests (9 tests - ForecastTable Component)**\n- Forecast/Availability section heading\n- Table headers (Material, Required Amount, Forecast Available, Shortage/Excess, Pending Deliveries)\n- Forecast rows with calculated surplus/shortage\n- Color coding (green for surplus, red for shortage)\n- Empty state handling\n\n**RUN-EQP Tests (6 tests - RunEquipmentTable Component)**\n- Equipment and Availability section heading\n- Table headers (Equipment, Status, Notes)\n- Equipment rows with status and notes\n- Maintenance details display\n- Empty state handling\n\n**RUN-EXT Tests (4 tests - ExternalAppLinks Component)**\n- \"View in Inventory App\" link visibility and functionality\n- \"View in Delivery App\" link visibility and functionality\n- Links open in new browser tabs with proper parameters\n\n### 6. **Data Types and Interfaces**\n\nKey types from `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/types/index.ts`:\n\n```typescript\ninterface RunDetail extends ProductionRun {\n  materials: RecipeMaterial[];      // Raw materials needed\n  forecasts: RunForecast[];         // Forecast availability data\n  equipment: RunEquipmentItem[];    // Equipment needed\n}\n\ntype RunStatus = \"Scheduled\" | \"Confirmed\" | \"In Progress\" | \"On Track\" | \n                 \"Material Shortage\" | \"Pending Approval\" | \"Cancelled\" | \"Completed\"\n```\n\n### 7. **Testing Infrastructure**\n\n**Playwright Config** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/playwright.config.ts`):\n- Base URL: `http://localhost:8888`\n- Test directory: `./tests`\n- Web server: Netlify dev on port 8888\n- Replay.io integration for recording/debugging\n- Action timeout: 15 seconds\n- Navigation timeout: 30 seconds\n\n**Testing Pattern** (from existing tests):\n- Uses `test.describe()` for test suites\n- Uses `page.getByTestId()` for element selection\n- Includes 30-second timeout for initial page load\n- Follows test ID naming convention: `[component]-[element]`\n\n### 8. **Key Test IDs Used**\n\nComponents use consistent data-testid naming:\n- `run-header` - RunHeader component container\n- `run-info-id`, `run-info-datetime`, `run-info-product`, `run-info-recipe`, `run-info-quantity`, `run-info-status`\n- `run-actions` - RunActions container\n- `adjust-quantities-btn`, `confirm-run-btn`, `cancel-run-btn`\n- `raw-materials-section`, `raw-materials-table`, `raw-material-row`\n- `forecast-section`, `forecast-table`, `forecast-row`\n- `run-equipment-section`, `run-equipment-table`, `run-equipment-row`\n- `external-app-links`, `inventory-app-link`, `delivery-app-link`\n\nThis comprehensive structure provides everything needed to write Playwright tests for all 47 RUN-* test specifications."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a58cb51470a51c0ae (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 59069\ntool_uses: 27\nduration_ms: 38313</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2c47f5c6-af02-4a26-9fd4-86798a345fba","uuid":"b636e7bd-3221-478b-add9-e71dea162263","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I need to understand the structure of the app that has test IDs starting with \"RUN-\".

Here's my complete report:\n\n### 1. **Tests.md File Location**\n- **Path**: `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/docs/tests.md`\n- **Contains**: Complete test specification for ProductionHub including RUN test entries (RUN-HDR-1 through RUN-EXT-4)\n- **Format**: Markdown with detailed test specifications using Given/When/Then format\n\n### 2. **App Directory**\n- **Location**: `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/`\n- **Type**: React/TypeScript application with Redux Toolkit state management\n- **Build System**: Vite\n- **Testing Framework**: Playwright with Replay.io integration\n- **Deployment**: Netlify Functions\n\n### 3. **Existing Test Files**\nLocated in `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/tests/`:\n- `calendar-header.spec.ts` - Tests for CAL-HDR tests\n- `calendar-grid.spec.ts` - Tests for CAL-GRID tests\n- `calendar-popup.spec.ts` - Tests for CAL-POP tests (production run popup)\n- `recipes-page.spec.ts` - Tests for REC-HDR, REC-TBL, REC-PNL tests\n\n**No existing RUN-* test files** - These need to be created.\n\n### 4. **Main Page Components and Structure**\n\n**RunDetailsPage** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/pages/RunDetailsPage.tsx`):\n- Route: `/runs/:runId`\n- Main component structure:\n\n| Section | Component | Test ID | Details |\n|---------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Header | `RunHeader` | `run-header` | Breadcrumb, title, high-level info card |\n| Actions | `RunActions` | `run-actions` | Adjust Quantities, Confirm Run, Cancel Run buttons |\n| Raw Materials | `RawMaterialsTable` | `raw-materials-section` | Materials needed for the run |\n| Forecast/Availability | `ForecastTable` | `forecast-section` | Material availability and shortages |\n| Equipment | `RunEquipmentTable` | `run-equipment-section` | Equipment required and status |\n| External Links | `ExternalAppLinks` | `external-app-links` | Links to inventory and delivery apps |\n\n### 5. **RUN Test Coverage (47 tests total)**\n\n**RUN-HDR Tests (13 tests - RunHeader Component)**\n- Breadcrumb navigation (Home, Runs, Run ID)\n- Page title display\n- High-Level Information section with fields:\n  - Run ID, Date/Time, Product, Associated Recipe, Planned Quantity, Status\n- Status badge styling (Scheduled, Confirmed, Cancelled)\n\n**RUN-ACT Tests (9 tests - RunActions Component)**\n- Adjust Quantities button and modal\n- Confirm Run button and status change\n- Cancel Run button and confirmation dialog\n- Action visibility based on run status (Scheduled, Confirmed, Cancelled)\n\n**RUN-MAT Tests (6 tests - RawMaterialsTable Component)**\n- Recipe and Raw Materials section heading\n- Table headers (Material, Amount Needed, Units)\n- Material rows with calculated amounts\n- Material amount updates when quantity changes\n- Empty state handling\n\n**RUN-FCST Tests (9 tests - ForecastTable Component)**\n- Forecast/Availability section heading\n- Table headers (Material, Required Amount, Forecast Available, Shortage/Excess, Pending Deliveries)\n- Forecast rows with calculated surplus/shortage\n- Color coding (green for surplus, red for shortage)\n- Empty state handling\n\n**RUN-EQP Tests (6 tests - RunEquipmentTable Component)**\n- Equipment and Availability section heading\n- Table headers (Equipment, Status, Notes)\n- Equipment rows with status and notes\n- Maintenance details display\n- Empty state handling\n\n**RUN-EXT Tests (4 tests - ExternalAppLinks Component)**\n- \"View in Inventory App\" link visibility and functionality\n- \"View in Delivery App\" link visibility and functionality\n- Links open in new browser tabs with proper parameters\n\n### 6. **Data Types and Interfaces**\n\nKey types from `/repo/apps/ProductionHub/src/types/index.ts`:\n\n```typescript\ninterface RunDetail extends ProductionRun {\n  materials: RecipeMaterial[];      // Raw materials needed\n  forecasts: RunForecast[];         // Forecast availability data\n  equipment: RunEquipmentItem[];    // Equipment needed\n}\n\ntype RunStatus = \"Scheduled\" | \"Confirmed\" | \"In Progress\" | \"On Track\" | \n                 \"Material Shortage\" | \"Pending Approval\" | \"Cancelled\" | \"Completed\"\n```\n\n### 7. **Testing Infrastructure**\n\n**Playwright Config** (`/repo/apps/ProductionHub/playwright.config.ts`):\n- Base URL: `http://localhost:8888`\n- Test directory: `./tests`\n- Web server: Netlify dev on port 8888\n- Replay.io integration for recording/debugging\n- Action timeout: 15 seconds\n- Navigation timeout: 30 seconds\n\n**Testing Pattern** (from existing tests):\n- Uses `test.describe()` for test suites\n- Uses `page.getByTestId()` for element selection\n- Includes 30-second timeout for initial page load\n- Follows test ID naming convention: `[component]-[element]`\n\n### 8. **Key Test IDs Used**\n\nComponents use consistent data-testid naming:\n- `run-header` - RunHeader component container\n- `run-info-id`, `run-info-datetime`, `run-info-product`, `run-info-recipe`, `run-info-quantity`, `run-info-status`\n- `run-actions` - RunActions container\n- `adjust-quantities-btn`, `confirm-run-btn`, `cancel-run-btn`\n- `raw-materials-section`, `raw-materials-table`, `raw-material-row`\n- `forecast-section`, `forecast-table`, `forecast-row`\n- `run-equipment-section`, `run-equipment-table`, `run-equipment-row`\n- `external-app-links`, `inventory-app-link`, `delivery-app-link`\n\nThis comprehensive structure provides everything needed to write Playwright tests for all 47 RUN-* test specifications."}],"totalDurationMs":38313,"totalTokens":59069,"totalToolUseCount":27,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2301,"cache_read_input_tokens":55212,"output_tokens":1551,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2301},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

[2026-02-25T01:28:58.299Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01LFB6DSu7nAQjPjzPiMDKv2","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the app. Let me set up the todo list and start writing tests. I need to create the test files for the RunDetailsPage.\n\nI'll create a single test file `run-details.spec.ts` that covers all 47 RUN-* test entries, organized by component sections.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The app uses data-testid attributes for element selection\n2. Existing tests use `page.goto()` with 30000ms timeout for initial page load\n3. The Breadcrumb component uses `data-testid=\"breadcrumb\"` with anchor links\n4. The ConfirmDialog uses `data-testid=\"confirm-dialog\"`, `confirm-dialog-confirm`, `confirm-dialog-cancel`\n\n\n5. The run details page is at `/runs/:runId` and the root route redirects to `/recipes`\n\nFor the tests, I need to figure out how to access a specific run since the database uses UUIDs rather than the \"RUN-12345\" format in the spec. I can either navigate through the calendar page to find an existing run, or fetch runs directly from the API and use a real UUID to navigate to the details page.\n\nLooking at how the existing tests are structured, they navigate directly to pages without API setup calls. So I'll create a helper that fetches available runs from the API during test setup, then navigates to one of them to run the assertions.\n\nWriting the test file...\n\nI'm realizing that several of these tests perform destructive operations—changing a run's status or modifying quantities—so I need to be careful about test isolation since they'll share the same database branch. The safest approach would be to either create fresh runs for each modification test or use distinct runs so tests don't interfere with each other's state.\n\nSince I don't know what runs already exist in the database, I'll fetch them via the API during the test setup. For tests that modify state, I'll create or select unique runs to avoid conflicts.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the test IDs I'll use throughout the component: `run-header` for the container, `breadcrumb` for navigation, `run-detail-title` for the page title, and then specific IDs for the info card fields like `run-info-id`, `run-info-status`, and so on. I'm also planning IDs for the action buttons and any modals that appear.\n\nSetting up test IDs for the data tables...\n\nNow I need to organize the test cases by the run status they require. Tests like RUN-HDR-1 through RUN-HDR-11 need a \"Scheduled\" run, while RUN-HDR-12 requires \"Confirmed\" and RUN-HDR-13 needs \"Cancelled\" — same pattern for the activity tests. I'm thinking through whether to find existing runs in the database with those statuses or create and modify them as needed.\n\nSince the guidance emphasizes completing unfinished implementations, I should make sure the app's run API is working properly. My approach will be to use `page.request` to query the API for runs with specific statuses, with helper functions to fetch runs and navigate to their detail pages.\n\nWriting test helper functions...\n\nFor the actual tests, I need to be pragmatic about the database state — I'll write tests that fetch runs from the API to find ones matching the required status, then navigate and assert behavior. For tests that modify data, I'll either use less critical runs or create fresh ones. The key insight is that the tests should work with whatever seed data exists, and if something's missing, that's a signal the app needs fixing. I'll avoid using toPass with auto-wait to keep the tests more explicit. I'm creating a single test file for all the run details navigation scenarios, and I need to verify the routing behavior carefully — when the Home breadcrumb navigates to \"/\", the app redirects to \"/recipes\", so I should check that the final URL is \"/recipes\" rather than just \"/\".\n\nFor the Runs breadcrumb, it should navigate directly to \"/calendar\" as specified. Now I'm going to write out all 47 tests, and for getting run data I'll make API calls within each test rather than using a shared setup, since different tests might need different run states.\n\nWriting the test file... I need to be careful about test isolation — I shouldn't modify runs that other tests depend on, so I'll create temporary runs for status-change tests using the API directly rather than relying on existing data.\n\nSetting up test data via API... Writing the test setup... Setting up test data...\n\nI'm realizing I should keep this simpler and just make the API calls directly in the tests rather than creating too many helper functions. Now I need to organize the test file structure—for the basic display tests, I just need to navigate to runs with different statuses and verify they render correctly. Let me start mapping out the individual test cases, beginning with the bread run scenario.\n\nFor the breadcrumb test, I'm checking that the component displays the navigation path correctly with \"Home\" and \"Runs\" as clickable links and the current RunID as plain text. I can query the breadcrumb element and verify it contains the expected text segments.\n\nFor the Home link navigation test, I need to click the Home link in the breadcrumb and verify it navigates to \"/recipes\" since the root path redirects there through react-router's Navigate component.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the full test suite structure: I'll cover the basic RunHeader display tests for any scheduled run, then add specific tests for each status badge type—blue for Scheduled, green for Confirmed, and red for Cancelled. For the status-specific tests, I can create temporary runs and update their statuses as needed.\n\nWriting the complete test file now...\n\nI should also verify that the \"Runs\" breadcrumb link navigates to /calendar as specified, and confirm that the Home link correctly ends up at /recipes since that's where \"/\" redirects. For the forecasts and equipment sections, the spec references placeholder data like Material X and Material Y, so I'll need to either use the actual seed data or fetch available data from the API to make the tests resilient.\n\nI'm going to structure this by fetching run data dynamically through the API rather than hardcoding assumptions about what exists in the database. This way the tests will work regardless of the specific seed data. Since there are 47 tests total, I'll keep all the RunDetailsPage tests in a single file to take advantage of worker sharing within the same spec file.\n\nWriting the test file with helper functions... I'm posting the test run data with the recipe ID and scheduling details, then navigating to the run's details page and waiting for the header to load.\n\nFor the details page, I need to be careful about loading states—the header only renders once the run data is fetched, so waiting for that element is the right signal. I'll keep the navigation function simple and add specific waits in individual tests if they need to verify other sections loading.\n\nNow I'm mapping out which test cases need which run states. Most of the header, activity, materials, forecast, and equipment tests work with a \"Scheduled\" run, but I need a few \"Confirmed\" runs for certain header and activity tests, and a couple \"Cancelled\" runs for others.\n\nFor the empty state tests, I'll create runs without a recipe so they have no materials, and I'm checking whether forecasts and equipment are tied to the recipe or the run itself to determine what else will be empty.\n\nNow I need to actually write out the test file, and I'm also realizing that for the confirmation and cancellation tests, I need to verify that the status change persists on the calendar view after the API call.\n\nFor the quantity adjustment test, I should check that the raw materials table updates immediately and that the change sticks when I navigate away and come back.\n\nThe material amount tests overlap with the quantity adjustment flow, so I'll make sure both are testing the same behavior but from different angles.\n\nLet me start writing the complete test file now, making sure each test matches the spec exactly.\n\nFor the breadcrumb tests, I'm checking that the separator renders correctly and that all the navigation elements are present. The status badge tests will verify the CSS classes applied to each status—scheduled gets the blue class, confirmed gets green, and cancelled gets red. I can assert on these class names directly in the tests.\n\nWriting the test file...\n\nFor RunActions, I need to cover the button visibility and functionality across different run statuses. The Adjust Quantities and Confirm Run buttons should only appear for Scheduled runs, while Cancel should work for both Scheduled and Confirmed. I'll also test the confirmation dialog for cancellation and verify that buttons disappear appropriately for terminal states.\n\nNow moving into the RawMaterialsTable tests...\n\nWriting test cases... Writing test cases... I'm realizing I shouldn't rely on CSS class selectors in the test since the guidelines require using data-testid attributes. Looking at the RunHeader component, the \"High-Level Information\" heading doesn't have a data-testid yet, so I need to add one to make the test properly identify the element.\n\nI should also check the other table components—RawMaterialsTable, ForecastTable, and RunEquipmentTable—to see if their section headings have testids. They all appear to use the same pattern with just CSS classes, so I'll need to add data-testid attributes to each of those headings as well. I'm going through each test systematically to identify which ones need testids added. Most of the header tests already have the necessary testids in place, but I'm finding gaps like the \"High-Level Information\" heading that needs `data-testid=\"run-info-heading\"`, and I need to continue checking the remaining tests to map out all the missing testids before implementing them. I'm verifying the remaining action items—confirming the run button updates the status correctly, the cancel run button and confirmation dialog are properly wired, and that action buttons are appropriately hidden when a run is cancelled or confirmed.\n\nNow I'm checking the materials section, where I need to add a testid for the \"Recipe and Raw Materials\" heading, verify the table structure and row identifiers are in place, and confirm the material amounts update correctly based on quantity changes. I also need to add a testid for the \"Forecast/Availability\" heading and continue validating that section's test coverage.\n\nFor the forecast section, the table headers and rows have proper testids, the color-coded backgrounds for surplus and shortage states are using the right classes, and I'm verifying that pending deliveries and external forecast data display correctly along with the empty state.\n\nNow moving into the equipment section—I notice the \"Equipment and Availability\" heading is missing a testid, but the table structure itself has the necessary identifiers. The equipment status and maintenance details are properly marked, and there's an empty state testid in place. I'm also checking the external links for inventory and delivery features.\n\nI'm realizing I need to add testids to four section headings across different components: the high-level information header, raw materials header, forecast header, and equipment header. Let me update those components first before writing the test file. I need to check what the formatRunDateTime function actually produces. Looking at the implementation, it formats the date as \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM AM/PM\" with spaces rather than the \"at\" that the spec mentions, so I'll need to account for that actual format in my test assertions. Writing the test function... Writing test cases...\n\nI'm realizing that `findRunByStatus` only gives me the basic run list without the nested materials and forecasts data, so I'll need to call `fetchRunDetail` separately to get the complete run information for accurate assertions.\n\nFor the modification tests, I should create fresh runs to avoid test interference, while read-only tests can reuse existing scheduled runs. The status-specific tests will need temporary runs where I can control the status changes, and the empty state tests require runs with no materials, forecasts, or equipment.\n\nThe tricky part is that newly created runs won't have forecasts or equipment data in the database, so tests checking those should stick with existing seeded runs. For ACT-2, the new run will still have materials from the recipe, which is fine. ACT-4 and ACT-6 just need to verify status changes work, so they don't need that data.\n\nThe real issue is that modifying a seeded run in one test could break other tests that depend on its original state. So I'll use seeded runs for read-only tests, but create fresh runs for any modification tests to avoid conflicts.\n\nFor MAT-5 specifically, I'll create a new run with materials, then update its quantity and verify the materials reflect that change. I'm also writing a helper function that fetches a run and checks whether it has the necessary data (materials, forecasts, equipment) before returning it.\n\nWriting helper function... Still writing helper functions...\n\nI'm settling on a straightforward approach where I fetch the first run with the target status and pull its full details only when needed in tests, which keeps things simple despite the extra API calls. Now I need to actually write out the test file itself and identify any missing test IDs or app functionality that needs to be added.\n\nLooking at what needs to change in the components, I'm adding test IDs to the section headings across RunHeader, RawMaterialsTable, ForecastTable, and RunEquipmentTable so I can reliably target them in tests. Before I finalize these edits though, I should double-check the spec requirements for RUN-ACT-2 around the raw materials validation.\n\nTracing through the flow when a user adjusts quantities: the modal opens, they change the value and save, which triggers the updateRun thunk to hit the API. Once the API responds with the updated run data, Redux updates the currentRun state, causing RunDetailsPage to re-render with the new planned_quantity. This flows down to RawMaterialsTable as a prop, which recalculates the material amounts using the formula `Number(m.quantity) * plannedQuantity`, so the table automatically reflects the changes.\n\nFor the RUN-MAT-5 test, I need to verify this end-to-end: navigate to a run with materials, note the initial amounts, open the adjust quantities modal, change the value, save it, and confirm the material amounts updated proportionally. I can write this as its own test that creates a fresh run rather than depending on another test's state.\n\nNow I'm ready to start writing the test code. But first, let me double-check the external links behavior—the spec mentions clicking should open in a new tab, and the component uses `target=\"_blank\"`. In Playwright, I need to handle how that works.\n\nWriting external link tests...\n\nNow I'm checking the Breadcrumb component structure to make sure the navigation hierarchy is correct—it should show Home > Runs > current run ID, with the current page as plain text rather than a link. I'm confident that using `locator` with `hasText` is the right approach here since the directive specifically warns against `getByText()`, and scoping to the breadcrumb element makes this selector specific enough. Now I'm ready to write the actual test code, and I need to organize the 47 tests by their sections—HDR, ACT, MAT, FCST, EQP, and EXT—to manage them in batches.\n\nI'm realizing the API call volume could be a problem with potentially 2+ calls per test across 47 tests, but since Playwright runs tests in parallel workers, each worker processes tests sequentially. I could cache run data at the describe level using `test.beforeAll`, though the constraint is that `page` is per-test so API calls have to happen within individual test functions.\n\nActually, I can use the `request` fixture in `beforeAll` since it's a global `APIRequestContext` that respects the configured baseURL, letting me fetch the scheduled run ID once and reuse it across all tests.\n\nSetting up the test file structure... Setting up the test structure with shared state...\n\nFor the tests that need specific run statuses, I'll create fresh runs inline within each test rather than relying on the shared setup—the overhead of one POST and one PUT per test is worth the isolation. I'm building out the confirmed and cancelled run test cases by creating runs with the appropriate status transitions. Writing the test file...\n\nFor the persistence checks, I can follow the existing pattern of navigating away and back to verify the data sticks. For ACT-4's calendar verification, I'll navigate to the calendar page and look for the run there, though pinpointing a specific run among the event cards might require checking the run's date or using a more targeted selector. I'll verify the status persists by navigating away from the run details page and back to confirm it's still \"Confirmed\", which proves the change was saved without the fragility of hunting for the run on the calendar across different months. I'll apply the same simplified approach to the other test cases.\n\nNow I'm ready to write the test code.\n\nWriting test file... I'm setting up the test fixture to fetch scheduled runs and find one with complete data across materials, forecasts, and equipment, then falling back to the first run if needed. I'm also defining a helper function to navigate to the scheduled run page and wait for it to load. Now I'm realizing that `test.beforeAll` in Playwright might need a different approach...\n\nActually, the `request` fixture should work fine with the baseURL configuration for relative paths. Let me write out the full test file and identify which tests need `test.slow()` to handle their longer execution times—specifically the ones that chain multiple user interactions like adjusting quantities, confirming runs, and verifying persistence across navigation.\n\nI'll structure the tests by creating all the necessary runs upfront in `beforeAll` using the API, then reference them in each test rather than creating them individually.\n\nSetting up test data... Creating test runs with different statuses and configurations...\n\nI'm also noticing the POST endpoint supports a `status` field that defaults to \"Scheduled\" if not provided, so I can explicitly set runs to \"Confirmed\" or \"Cancelled\" as needed. can create runs with a specific status directly. The API destructures `status` from the request body and uses it in the INSERT statement, so I can pass any status when creating a run. But according to the ACT-4 spec, I need a run that starts as \"Scheduled\" and transitions to \"Confirmed\" when the button is clicked — I can't just pre-create a \"Confirmed\" run for that test. However, for the other tests like HDR-12 and ACT-9, I do need runs that are already in the \"Confirmed\" state. So my setup should create a \"Confirmed\" run for those tests, a \"Cancelled\" run for another set of tests, and handle the \"Scheduled\" run separately since it needs to demonstrate the state change. Defining the run variables...\n\nI'm realizing I could consolidate these runs further—reusing the same run across multiple tests where possible, but the modification tests like ACT-2, ACT-4, and ACT-6 need their own dedicated runs since they change the run's state. Creating them within those tests adds latency, but since they're already marked as slow tests, that's acceptable. Alternatively, I could set them up in beforeAll and have each test use its assigned run, with ACT-4 starting as Scheduled and transitioning to Confirmed when the test clicks the button.\n\nSetting up the variable declarations...\n\nIn beforeAll, I'm fetching the recipe list to get an ID for creating test runs, then searching through existing Scheduled runs to find one with populated materials, forecasts, and equipment data. Creating test runs with different statuses... Setting up test runs for different scenarios...\n\nI'm realizing there's a dependency issue here—ACT-7 needs a Scheduled run to test dismissing the cancel confirmation, but ACT-6 will have already cancelled that same run. Since tests execute in order, I need to create separate runs for each test that modifies state, so ACT-7 gets its own fresh Scheduled run to work with. I'm realizing that dismissing a dialog doesn't actually change any state, so I can safely reuse the main scheduled run for the read-only tests like ACT-7. The same goes for ACT-1, ACT-3, and ACT-5 — they're just checking button visibility without modifying anything. Let me consolidate: the main scheduled run can handle all the header tests, the visibility checks, the material and forecast tests, and the equipment test since none of them alter the run's state.\n\nFor the state-modifying tests, I need to be careful. ACT-2 and MAT-5 both adjust quantities, so if they run against the same run, the first test will change the quantity and the second will see the modified value. I should either use separate runs for each or ensure the tests account for the changed state.\n\nLooking at MAT-5's spec more closely, it needs to verify that material amounts update proportionally when the planned quantity changes—so it requires a before-and-after comparison. I'll create separate run instances for these quantity-adjustment tests to keep them isolated.\n\nRather than pre-creating a batch of runs upfront, I'll generate them inline within each test that needs modification. This keeps tests self-contained and the test.slow() timeout handles the extra setup time. For ACT-2, ACT-4, ACT-6, and MAT-5, I'll spin up a fresh run within each test. I'm settling on a cleaner approach where modification tests create their own runs for independence, while the read-only status runs stay in beforeAll to avoid duplication. So I'll set up the scheduled, confirmed, cancelled, and empty runs once, then have ACT-2, ACT-4, ACT-6, and MAT-5 each spin up their own scheduled runs inline to test their specific modifications.\n\nFor ACT-4 and ACT-6 though, I need to account for the multi-step flows—confirming or cancelling a run, then navigating away and back to verify the status persists, which means those tests will need to handle the full navigation cycle.\n\nNow I'm planning the component edits to add the necessary data-testid attributes across RunHeader, RawMaterialsTable, and ForecastTable.\n\nI'm structuring the test file with organized describe blocks for each component section—RunHeader, RunActions, RawMaterialsTable, and ForecastTable—to keep the tests readable and maintainable.\n\nNow I need to verify the CSS classes used in ForecastTable for the surplus and shortage indicators, so I can write accurate assertions for those tests. The surplus cases use `forecast-surplus` and shortage cases use `forecast-shortage`, which I'll check in the test assertions.\n\nFor the remaining FCST tests, I'm looking at what data validation I need—FCST-3 should verify the actual forecast values from the database, FCST-4 and FCST-5 check the correct styling classes are applied based on whether there's a surplus or shortage, and FCST-6 needs to confirm the calculation logic for shortage/excess is correct.\n\nWriting test code... Writing test assertions... I'm finishing up the test assertions for the forecast row by checking the shortage/excess calculation and any pending delivery information. Now I'm moving on to write the next test case that verifies equipment data displays correctly in the run table.\n\nFor the remaining equipment tests, I need to filter for specific equipment statuses — finding items marked as \"Available\" for one test and \"Scheduled\" for another.\n\nWriting test cases... I need to verify the navigation behavior—when the breadcrumb navigates to \"/\", the redirect will replace the history entry and land on \"/recipes\", so my test should check for that URL. Now I'm writing out the test file and need to make sure the test IDs I'm using match what's already defined in the components.\n\nCompiling the full list of test IDs across all the components... Now I'm adding the remaining test IDs for the external app links and section headings, then I'll implement everything. I'm also thinking through a couple of edge cases—the Run ID could be in UUID format, and date formatting might vary depending on timezone, so I need to make sure the tests are flexible enough to handle those variations. the `scheduledRunDetail` API response includes a `materials` array where each material has a per-batch quantity that gets multiplied by the `planned_quantity` to calculate the displayed amount. For MAT-4 and MAT-5, I need to verify that the material amounts update correctly based on this calculation when the planned quantity changes. Now I'm ready to write out the test file and component edits to cover all 47
