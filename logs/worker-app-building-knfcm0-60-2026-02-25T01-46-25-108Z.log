Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    99→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   100→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   101→\n   102→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   103→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   104→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   105→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   106→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   107→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   108→\n   109→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   110→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   111→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   112→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   113→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   114→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   115→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption.

Tests across\n   124→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   125→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   126→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   127→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   128→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   129→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   130→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   131→  being unmodified.\n   132→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   133→  you need to interact with.\n   134→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   135→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   136→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   137→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   138→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   139→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   140→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   141→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   142→\n   143→## Tips\n   144→\n   145→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   146→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   147→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   148→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   149→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   150→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   151→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   152→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   153→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   154→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8733df43-9372-40ef-9612-b5aed8aa16cd","uuid":"ebb14c1b-f708-4745-a92d-b4ed22b38ef3","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":154,"startLine":1,"totalLines":154}}}

[2026-02-25T01:42:58.764Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01MFebc24P9ZKonQRZuZE5mU","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a comprehensive understanding:\n\n**Seed data equipment** (6 items, ordered by name):\n1. CNC Router - 1 unit, Maintenance\n2. Conveyor Belt - 4 units, Operational\n3. Heat Press - 2 units, Operational\n4. Industrial Mixer - 3 units, Operational\n5. Packaging Line - 2 units, Operational\n6. Quality Scanner - 2 units, Operational\n\nWith PAGE_SIZE=5, there are 2 pages initially:\n- Page 1: CNC Router, Conveyor Belt, Heat Press, Industrial Mixer, Packaging Line\n\n\n- Page 2: Quality Scanner\n\nI'm noticing a mismatch between the test spec and the actual seed data. The tests reference equipment like \"High-Speed Mixer (HSM-2000)\" and \"Heavy-Duty Forklift (HDF-5T)\" that don't exist in the database, and they expect specific ID formats like \"E-4021\" when the actual IDs are UUIDs. The test spec appears to have been written against mock data rather than the real seed data.\n\nI need to decide whether to update the tests to match the actual seed data, create the missing equipment records, or implement the missing app features that the tests expect. Since the skill requires me to write tests that verify expected user behavior and complete any unimplemented features, I should check what actually needs to be created versus what needs to be adapted. I'll follow the same pattern as the recipes tests—for the delete test, I'll create a temporary equipment record rather than relying on seed data that doesn't exist. For EQ-TBL-4, I'll use the existing \"Industrial Mixer\" since it matches the unit count change in the spec. For EQ-TBL-8, I'll pick any existing equipment and verify the navigation URL pattern works correctly. I'll create the Heavy-Duty Forklift as a setup step for the delete test since it's not in the seed data, and use any existing equipment for the cancel delete test. For the row navigation test, I'll ignore the mock UUID spec and just verify the URL uses whatever ID the actual row has. With 6 seed items and a page size of 5, I need to account for pagination across the test cases. I'm realizing the pagination only renders when there are multiple pages, and with 6 seed items at PAGE_SIZE=5 I get exactly 2 pages, so I should adjust my test expectations to work with that constraint rather than trying to force 3 pages. Let me refocus the tests on verifying the core pagination behavior—checking that the page indicator displays correctly, navigation buttons work, and disabled states are applied appropriately on the first and last pages. I'm realizing the pagination tests have a constraint issue—with 6 items and a page size of 5, I can only generate 2 pages, but the spec expects 3 pages for EQ-TBL-10 and EQ-TBL-11. I'll need to adjust my approach to work with the actual data available rather than the spec's assumed page count, focusing on verifying pagination navigation works correctly regardless of the exact page numbers. Since tests run in parallel with shared database access, the seed data with 6 items and a page size of 5 gives me 2 pages to work with, which is enough for basic pagination testing. I'm looking at the existing Pagination component selectors to understand what elements I need to target for the tests. The spec references equipment that doesn't exist in the seed data, so I need to map the test cases to actual records. For the edit test, \"Industrial Mixer\" with 3 units matches the spec's requirement to change from 3 to 4 units. For the delete tests, I'll create a temporary record for the main delete flow and use existing data for the cancel scenario. For the details view test, I need to find which equipment ID corresponds to the spec's reference. Writing the test file... Writing test cases... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions... Writing test cases... Writing test cases... Writing pagination tests... Finishing the test assertions...\n\nI need to think through the search scenario for the equipment table. Unlike the recipes table, there's no search functionality here, so newly created equipment gets sorted alphabetically by the API. With the seed data ordered as CNC Router, Conveyor Belt, Heat Press, Industrial Mixer, and Packaging Line, a new item could land on page 2 depending on its name. The parallel test execution adds complexity since other tests might be creating items simultaneously, affecting pagination.\n\nFor EQ-TBL-6, since the temp item name starts with \"TempDelete\", it would sort after \"Quality Scanner\" alphabetically, placing it on page 2 with 7 total items. Rather than hardcoding page navigation, I could either navigate to the last page to find the item or give it a name that sorts predictably to the first page.\n\nLooking at how the recipe test handles this with search, I realize the Equipment page doesn't have that option. The cleaner solution is to name the item something like \"AAA Delete Test Equipment\" so it appears on page 1 regardless of pagination. Now I'm checking how the EquipmentTable component handles the item creation—specifically what happens when the `createEquipment` action dispatches and the table re-fetches the

When new items are created, they're pushed to the end of the `items` array. But when the page is refreshed, items come back sorted by name from the API (`ORDER BY name`). So after creating a new item, it appears at the end of the list (which could be the last page), but after page reload, it appears in alphabetical order.\n\nFor the delete test (EQ-TBL-6), I'll create a temp item and then find it. Since it's appended to the end of the items array, it will appear on the last page. I can navigate to the last page to find it.\n\nActually wait - the `createEquipment.fulfilled` handler does `state.items.push(action.payload)`, which adds it to the end. \n\nWith PAGE_SIZE=5 and 6 existing items, a new item becomes the 7th and lands on page 2. But if I'm viewing page 1 when the item is created, the `safePage` calculation keeps me there, so I won't see the new item without navigating to page 2. This means the test needs to handle pagination after creation.\n\nAfter the create action, the new item gets pushed to the end of the items array, so it ends up on page 2. I could either navigate to the last page to find it, or refresh the page entirely with `page.goto(\"/equipment\")` to re-fetch and re-sort the data alphabetically. The spec just says the new equipment should appear in the table with the entered values—it doesn't specify which page, so navigating to find it should be acceptable. For the test, I'll add equipment with a name that sorts later alphabetically, then navigate to the last page to verify it appears there. After returning to the equipment list, the data will be fetched fresh and sorted by name, so I can confirm the item persists in the correct position. ...the new item gets appended to the end of the list. Since other tests might also create items, I can't predict the exact page number. The most reliable approach is to reload the page after creating, which gives me a fresh fetch with items sorted by name, then I can verify the item appears on the expected page. After creating the item, I'll navigate away and come back to verify it persists, then search through pages to locate it in the table. The test just needs to confirm the new equipment appears somewhere in the list with the correct values, so I'll keep the approach straightforward and write the test now.\n\nFor the individual test cases, I'm planning to use existing items where possible—\"Industrial Mixer\" for the edit test, \"Conveyor Belt\" for another—and create a temporary item for the deletion test that I'll need to hunt down across pages. For the pagination tests, I have enough seed data to work with multiple pages, and I'll verify the URL changes when clicking rows.\n\nNow I'm realizing the complexity with shared database state across parallel tests—each test has its own Redux state but they're all hitting the same database. So I need to account for the possibility that other tests have already created items. My approach is to navigate to the last page after creating an item (since new items append to the Redux array), and after a reload, navigate based on alphabetical sorting since \"Test Equipment\" will sort near the end of the list. named \"AAA Delete Test\" so it sorts to page 1, making it easy to find both immediately and after reload.\n\nLet me reconsider the positioning of newly created equipment. After pushing to the state, the item lands at the end of the array, which means it'll be on the last page. Since the fetched items are ordered by name, \"Test Equipment\" would sort near the end too, so I'd need to navigate to the last page either way. I'll just use the last page button whenever I need to locate a newly created item.\n\nFor the delete test, I'm thinking I'll create a temporary item, navigate to find it on the last page, delete it, verify it's gone, then check that it stays deleted after reloading. Though I could also just use an existing item from the spec instead of creating one.\n\nWriting the test file now...\n\nWriting test file... Writing test assertions... Writing test assertions...\n\nActually, I'm reconsidering the use of `isVisible()` in a conditional here—the skill directives warn against putting Playwright calls with auto-wait semantics inside retry blocks, but using it standalone in an `if` statement should be fine since there's no retry logic involved.\n\nThough there's still a risk: if pagination doesn't exist (like when there's only one page), `isVisible()` will wait until timeout. A safer approach would be to reload the page after creating the equipment so items are sorted by name, then just verify the new item appears in the list without relying on pagination navigation. with T, it's near the end. I can navigate to the last page if pagination exists to find the new item.\n\nActually, I'm overcomplicating this. The practical approach is simpler—just check if pagination is visible and click the last page button if it is. I'll use `isVisible()` without a timeout since it returns immediately in Playwright.\n\nNow I'm realizing there's a timing consideration here. When the new item gets added to the Redux array, it lands at index 6 (the 7th position). With 5 items per page, that puts it on page 2. The EquipmentTable component will recalculate `totalPages = ceil(7/5) = 2`, so pagination should render automatically after the state updates. Let me trace through what the component actually does with the new items list. I need to reload the page to trigger a fresh fetch from the API when the EquipmentPage mounts, which verifies the persistence check. I'll add a wait after creating equipment to ensure the Redux store updates and pagination appears before proceeding with the test assertions.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the remaining test cases: checking table column data, verifying edit and delete buttons work with persistence checks, testing row navigation to detail pages, and validating pagination controls across multiple pages.\n\nI need to verify that the pagination buttons disable appropriately at the boundaries—previous should be disabled on the first page and next should be disabled on the last page. I'm also clarifying how Playwright's `isVisible()` method works since it returns a boolean Promise immediately without waiting, so I can use it directly in assertions.\n\nFor the delete test, I'm thinking through the flow: create a temporary item via the Add Equipment modal, then navigate to the last page to find it, and delete it while verifying the removal persists.\n\nWriting the complete test file now...\n\nActually, I'm realizing a potential issue with test isolation—if EQ-TBL-4 modifies the Industrial Mixer's unit count from 3 to 4, and EQ-TBL-2 expects it to be 3, these tests could interfere with each other when running in parallel.\n\nThe safest approach is to use a different equipment item for EQ-TBL-2 so the tests don't share mutable state in the database. relative values instead of absolute\n\nFor EQ-TBL-2, the spec describes the general structure—title, description, and available units—so I could use \"Conveyor Belt\" with its 4 units without worrying about other tests modifying it. For EQ-TBL-4, the spec references \"High-Speed Mixer (HSM-2000)\" which doesn't actually exist, so I'll need to pick an existing item like \"Industrial Mixer\" with 3 units that matches the spec's range. This approach keeps the tests isolated since they'd be checking different equipment.\n\nThe cleanest solution is to use \"Conveyor Belt\" for EQ-TBL-2 and \"Industrial Mixer\" for EQ-TBL-4—even if EQ-TBL-4 modifies the mixer's unit count in the database, there's no conflict since they're testing different rows. I need to make sure any persistence checks after edits see the updated values correctly.\n\nSince each test runs in its own browser context and loads fresh data from the database, mutations from one test could theoretically affect others looking at the same equipment, but my test selection avoids this—EQ-HDR-4 creates new data, EQ-TBL-4 only modifies \"Industrial Mixer\" for its own edit test, and EQ-TBL-6 creates and deletes without affecting other tests. For EQ-TBL-8, the spec references a specific ID \"E-4021\" but our system uses UUIDs, so I'll need to adapt that reference to work with the actual ID format.\n\nWriting the test file
