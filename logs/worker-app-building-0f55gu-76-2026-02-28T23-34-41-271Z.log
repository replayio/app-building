Now let me start **Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage**. I need to systematically check each test entry in the SupplierDetailsPage section of `docs/tests.md` against the testSpec.md directives. The SupplierDetailsPage test entries span lines 226-447 of docs/tests.md. Let me re-read th... (truncated)\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage\n\nThe SupplierDetailsPage section in docs/tests.md (lines 226-447) has these sections:\n- **SupplierOverview** (lines 232-279)\n- **DocumentsTab** (lines 281-323)\n- **CommentsSection** (lines 325-364)\n- **OrdersSection** (lines 366-446)\n\nLet me now systematically check each test entry against testSpec.md directives.\n\n### Checking testSpec.md directives against SupplierDetailsPage entries:\n\n**Directive 1: Systematically inventory every visible element — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n\nLet me check each section:\n\n**SupplierOverview section** (lines 232-279):\n- Display Supplier Name ✓\n- Display Supplier Address ✓ \n- Display Contact Information ✓\n- Display Supplier Description ✓\n- Display Status Badge ✓\n- Back to Dashboard Button Navigates to Dashboard ✓\n- Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog ✓\n- Delete Supplier with Confirmation ✓\n\n**Breadcrumb navigation** (line 228): Specified: \"Home > Suppliers > \\<Supplier Name\\> > Supplier Details\". Clicking \"Home\" → /. Clicking \"Suppliers\" → /.\n\nLet me check: is there a test entry for the breadcrumb navigation itself? Let me re-read the section carefully.\n\nLooking at lines 226-228:\n```\n## SupplierDetailsPage (/suppliers/:supplierId)\n\nBreadcrumb navigation shows \"Home > Suppliers > <Supplier Name> > Supplier Details\". Clicking \"Home\" navigates to /. Clicking \"Suppliers\" navigates to /.\n```\n\nThis specifies breadcrumb behavior but there's no dedicated test entry for it. Let me check if there's a test entry for breadcrumb.\n\nLooking at the SupplierDetailsPage section... I see there's no test entry titled for the breadcrumb navigation. The breadcrumb is described in the page header but not as a testable entry with a Given/When/Then.\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.**\n\nThe breadcrumb has clickable elements (\"Home\" → /, \"Suppliers\" → /) but no dedicated test entry. However, the behavior IS specified at line 228 — it just doesn't follow Given/When/Then format as a test entry.\n\nLet me also check the tab links described at line 230: \"Below the SupplierOverview section, three tab links appear: 'Documents', 'Comments', 'Orders'. Clicking a tab scrolls to or reveals that section's content.\"\n\nThere's no test entry for the tab navigation itself.\n\n**DocumentsTab section** (lines 281-323):\n- Display Document Cards with Details ✓\n- Display Multiple Document Cards ✓\n- Search Documents by Name ✓\n- Search Documents Clears Results ✓\n- Upload Document Button Opens Upload Dialog ✓\n- View Document Action ✓\n- Download Document Action ✓\n\n**Directive 8: Attachment functionality should support file uploads**\nThe Upload Document test entry (lines 307-313) does specify file upload. ✓\n\n**CommentsSection** (lines 325-364):\n- Display Comments Header with Count ✓\n- Display Comment List with Timestamps and Authors ✓\n- Add Comment via Input Field ✓\n- Add Comment Persists After Reload ✓\n- Collapse and Expand Comments Section ✓\n- Empty Comment Validation ✓\n\n**Directive 5: For any user action that mutates data, verify change is persisted and side effects occur**\n- \"Add Comment via Input Field\" verifies the comment appears and count increments ✓\n- \"Add Comment Persists After Reload\" verifies persistence ✓\n\n**OrdersSection** (lines 366-446):\n- Display Upcoming and Historical Order Tabs ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Data ✓\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Data ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Search Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Search Historical Orders ✓\n- Filter Upcoming Orders by Status ✓\n- Status Badges in Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Status Badges in Historical Orders ✓\n- Switch Between Tabs ✓\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target**\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78901\" ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78801\" ✓\n\n**Directive 7: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**\n- Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog: Tests opening, pre-filled values, save, and persistence ✓\n- Delete Supplier with Confirmation: Tests confirmation dialog ✓\n- Upload Document: Tests file upload dialog ✓\n\nNow let me check if there's a test entry for the **Edit Supplier Dialog Validation** — the directive says to completely test modal dialogs. The edit dialog has a save action but no validation test. Let me also check if there's a cancel test for edit. Looking at the entry on line 266-270:\n\n```\n**Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog**\nGiven the user is viewing the SupplierDetailsPage,\nWhen the user clicks the \"Edit\" button in SupplierOverview,\nThen a modal dialog opens pre-filled with the supplier's current values (name, address, contact name, phone, email, description, status),\nAnd when the user changes the contact phone number and clicks \"Save\",\nThen the updated phone number is persisted and reflected in SupplierOverview.\n```\n\nThere's no cancel test and no validation test for the Edit Supplier dialog. For the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard, there ARE cancel and validation entries. This is inconsistent.\n\nSimilarly, for the Delete Supplier, there's no test for what happens if the user cancels the confirmation dialog.\n\nLet me also check if there are missing entries per **Directive 6: Button and control appearance matters**. I see status badge entries cover color coding. Let me check if there are entries for the Edit/Delete button appearance (icons, styling).\n\nThe Edit button mention at line 267 says \"Edit\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\nThe Delete button mention at line 273 says \"Delete\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\n\nHowever, this level of detail may not be required since the spec doesn't show a mockup for this page.\n\nLet me now also check: the breadcrumb navigation is specified in the header but not tested with entries. I see the Dashboard page also specifies breadcrumb for detail pages at line 10: \"Breadcrumb navigation appears on detail pages (SupplierDetailsPage, OrderDetailsPage).\"\n\nLet me check if there are test entries for breadcrumb navigation in the OrderDetailsPage section for comparison.\n\nLooking at line 452: \"Breadcrumb navigation shows 'Dashboard > Orders > Order #\\<orderId\\>'. Clicking 'Dashboard' navigates to /. Clicking 'Orders' navigates to /.\"\n\nSame pattern — breadcrumb specified in header but no dedicated test entries. This is consistent across pages, so while it could be a violation, it's a pattern across the whole app.\n\nLet me now summarize the potential violations I've found:\n\n1. **Missing breadcrumb navigation test entries** — The breadcrumb is described in the page header but lacks dedicated Given/When/Then test entries. Per directive \"systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"for every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation targe... (truncated)\n\n2. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog cancel test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a cancel test (similar to how the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard has \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\").\n\n3. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog validation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a validation test (similar to \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" on the Dashboard).\n\n4. **Missing Delete Supplier cancel confirmation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Delete Supplier confirmation should have a test for canceling/dismissing the confirmation.\n\nWait — let me re-check if the breadcrumb issue was already found and fixed. Let me check the recent commits.\n$ git log --oneline -20\n88bd202 CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage: Check testSpec.md direc...

Now let me start **Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage**. I need to systematically check each test entry in the SupplierDetailsPage section of `docs/tests.md` against the testSpec.md directives. The SupplierDetailsPage test entries span lines 226-447 of docs/tests.md. Let me re-read th... (truncated)\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage\n\nThe SupplierDetailsPage section in docs/tests.md (lines 226-447) has these sections:\n- **SupplierOverview** (lines 232-279)\n- **DocumentsTab** (lines 281-323)\n- **CommentsSection** (lines 325-364)\n- **OrdersSection** (lines 366-446)\n\nLet me now systematically check each test entry against testSpec.md directives.\n\n### Checking testSpec.md directives against SupplierDetailsPage entries:\n\n**Directive 1: Systematically inventory every visible element — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.**\n\nLet me check each section:\n\n**SupplierOverview section** (lines 232-279):\n- Display Supplier Name ✓\n- Display Supplier Address ✓ \n- Display Contact Information ✓\n- Display Supplier Description ✓\n- Display Status Badge ✓\n- Back to Dashboard Button Navigates to Dashboard ✓\n- Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog ✓\n- Delete Supplier with Confirmation ✓\n\n**Breadcrumb navigation** (line 228): Specified: \"Home > Suppliers > \\<Supplier Name\\> > Supplier Details\". Clicking \"Home\" → /. Clicking \"Suppliers\" → /.\n\nLet me check: is there a test entry for the breadcrumb navigation itself? Let me re-read the section carefully.\n\nLooking at lines 226-228:\n```\n## SupplierDetailsPage (/suppliers/:supplierId)\n\nBreadcrumb navigation shows \"Home > Suppliers > <Supplier Name> > Supplier Details\". Clicking \"Home\" navigates to /. Clicking \"Suppliers\" navigates to /.\n```\n\nThis specifies breadcrumb behavior but there's no dedicated test entry for it. Let me check if there's a test entry for breadcrumb.\n\nLooking at the SupplierDetailsPage section... I see there's no test entry titled for the breadcrumb navigation. The breadcrumb is described in the page header but not as a testable entry with a Given/When/Then.\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result.**\n\nThe breadcrumb has clickable elements (\"Home\" → /, \"Suppliers\" → /) but no dedicated test entry. However, the behavior IS specified at line 228 — it just doesn't follow Given/When/Then format as a test entry.\n\nLet me also check the tab links described at line 230: \"Below the SupplierOverview section, three tab links appear: 'Documents', 'Comments', 'Orders'. Clicking a tab scrolls to or reveals that section's content.\"\n\nThere's no test entry for the tab navigation itself.\n\n**DocumentsTab section** (lines 281-323):\n- Display Document Cards with Details ✓\n- Display Multiple Document Cards ✓\n- Search Documents by Name ✓\n- Search Documents Clears Results ✓\n- Upload Document Button Opens Upload Dialog ✓\n- View Document Action ✓\n- Download Document Action ✓\n\n**Directive 8: Attachment functionality should support file uploads**\nThe Upload Document test entry (lines 307-313) does specify file upload. ✓\n\n**CommentsSection** (lines 325-364):\n- Display Comments Header with Count ✓\n- Display Comment List with Timestamps and Authors ✓\n- Add Comment via Input Field ✓\n- Add Comment Persists After Reload ✓\n- Collapse and Expand Comments Section ✓\n- Empty Comment Validation ✓\n\n**Directive 5: For any user action that mutates data, verify change is persisted and side effects occur**\n- \"Add Comment via Input Field\" verifies the comment appears and count increments ✓\n- \"Add Comment Persists After Reload\" verifies persistence ✓\n\n**OrdersSection** (lines 366-446):\n- Display Upcoming and Historical Order Tabs ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Upcoming Orders Data ✓\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Table with Correct Columns ✓\n- Display Historical Orders Data ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details ✓\n- Search Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Search Historical Orders ✓\n- Filter Upcoming Orders by Status ✓\n- Status Badges in Upcoming Orders ✓\n- Status Badges in Historical Orders ✓\n- Switch Between Tabs ✓\n\n**Directive 4: For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target**\n- Upcoming Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78901\" ✓\n- Historical Order ID Links Navigate to Order Details: specifies \"/orders/PO-78801\" ✓\n\n**Directive 7: Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**\n- Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog: Tests opening, pre-filled values, save, and persistence ✓\n- Delete Supplier with Confirmation: Tests confirmation dialog ✓\n- Upload Document: Tests file upload dialog ✓\n\nNow let me check if there's a test entry for the **Edit Supplier Dialog Validation** — the directive says to completely test modal dialogs. The edit dialog has a save action but no validation test. Let me also check if there's a cancel test for edit. Looking at the entry on line 266-270:\n\n```\n**Edit Supplier Opens Edit Dialog**\nGiven the user is viewing the SupplierDetailsPage,\nWhen the user clicks the \"Edit\" button in SupplierOverview,\nThen a modal dialog opens pre-filled with the supplier's current values (name, address, contact name, phone, email, description, status),\nAnd when the user changes the contact phone number and clicks \"Save\",\nThen the updated phone number is persisted and reflected in SupplierOverview.\n```\n\nThere's no cancel test and no validation test for the Edit Supplier dialog. For the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard, there ARE cancel and validation entries. This is inconsistent.\n\nSimilarly, for the Delete Supplier, there's no test for what happens if the user cancels the confirmation dialog.\n\nLet me also check if there are missing entries per **Directive 6: Button and control appearance matters**. I see status badge entries cover color coding. Let me check if there are entries for the Edit/Delete button appearance (icons, styling).\n\nThe Edit button mention at line 267 says \"Edit\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\nThe Delete button mention at line 273 says \"Delete\" button — but doesn't describe icon or styling.\n\nHowever, this level of detail may not be required since the spec doesn't show a mockup for this page.\n\nLet me now also check: the breadcrumb navigation is specified in the header but not tested with entries. I see the Dashboard page also specifies breadcrumb for detail pages at line 10: \"Breadcrumb navigation appears on detail pages (SupplierDetailsPage, OrderDetailsPage).\"\n\nLet me check if there are test entries for breadcrumb navigation in the OrderDetailsPage section for comparison.\n\nLooking at line 452: \"Breadcrumb navigation shows 'Dashboard > Orders > Order #\\<orderId\\>'. Clicking 'Dashboard' navigates to /. Clicking 'Orders' navigates to /.\"\n\nSame pattern — breadcrumb specified in header but no dedicated test entries. This is consistent across pages, so while it could be a violation, it's a pattern across the whole app.\n\nLet me now summarize the potential violations I've found:\n\n1. **Missing breadcrumb navigation test entries** — The breadcrumb is described in the page header but lacks dedicated Given/When/Then test entries. Per directive \"systematically inventory every visible element\" and \"for every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation targe... (truncated)\n\n2. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog cancel test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a cancel test (similar to how the \"Add New Supplier\" dialog on the Dashboard has \"Create Supplier Dialog Cancel Does Not Create Supplier\").\n\n3. **Missing Edit Supplier Dialog validation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Edit Supplier dialog should have a validation test (similar to \"Create Supplier Dialog Validation\" on the Dashboard).\n\n4. **Missing Delete Supplier cancel confirmation test** — Per directive \"completely test that modal dialogs work properly\", the Delete Supplier confirmation should have a test for canceling/dismissing the confirmation.\n\nWait — let me re-check if the breadcrumb issue was already found and fixed. Let me check the recent commits.\n$ git log --oneline -20\n88bd202 CheckTestSpecSupplierDetailsPage: Check testSpec.md direc...

Let me analyze each and write the analysis files. Let me summarize what I found:\n\n**Log 84 (eghui7-84)**: CheckDirectives for OrderDetailsPage. Hit API Error 500. Had shell commands: `ls`, `cat`, `head`. Duration 7398ms, 5 turns. Failed, retry 2/3.\n\nWait, let me re-read more carefully.\n\n**Log 84**: Task was CheckDirectives for OrderDetailsPage (testSpec, writeApp, writeTests). Agent read skill files with Read tool and used glob tool. Then hit API Error 500. Duration 7398ms, 5 turns. \n\nActually, looking more carefully at the tool calls - the agent used Read and glob which are tools, not shell commands, so no direct shell invocations there. **Log 85** had the same task but this time the agent ran `ls /repo/apps/` as a shell command before hitting the same API Error 500, lasting 8919ms across 5 turns and ultimately skipped after 3 failed attempts. **Log 86** is CheckDirectives for SupplierDetailsPage and also encountered API Error 500.\n\n**Log 87** is another CheckDirectives for SupplierDetailsPage with a much longer execution. The agent made multiple tool calls and ran several shell commands including listing the apps directory, examining a tasks JSON file, and checking git history with log and show commands before hitting API Error 500 again - this one took 97604ms over 25 turns. **Log 88** appears to be starting another CheckDirectives task.\n\nNow looking at **Log 88** continuing with SupplierDetailsPage, it ran a directory listing command but hit API Error 500 again after just 4 turns and 12251ms, with the task failing 3 times total before being skipped. **Log 89** moved on to CheckDirectives for DashboardPage in the SupplierTracker app, running commands to find dashboard-related files, but the task didn't signal completion so it's retrying. **Log 9** is now attempting to fix open bug reports with initial directory and file search commands, though the command appears to be cut off.\n\nThe final command in Log 9 is searching for bug report files across the repo with various naming conventions, and it successfully signaled DONE after 18 turns and 39176ms. **Log mimlkq-1** shows an idle worker that started, listened for tasks, and shut down without processing anything. Now I'm preparing to write analysis files for each of these logs.","signature":"EoIVCkYICxgCKkCZgFussgEi9rOmrqvC0zjZC5BXwIGj4nVHquY20mMfyqkpLdtSZTgjdjw4Ha50oOj9XbwPHWC0jFOcpsThfFD9EgxVQl2crlFD4NN57BwaDHvePt4rqwx5qFUgniIwABtoSuIma+ihTAOc9fr4dhKMVqcbx1EAlhAD5YYGIEbBuRCn7CeEESBszNG1EGdlKukTdHI5ok+UDKx1QcV+i8RqS8yxklU3SiAUHPVb7wvjtnq14YksCt+J0szxVKTVYI10z7sSZhwhM+CXx+gJbwjWs+8mreXMU4243czeTqJvfv4J/Gm6nsyRKPLKV3yY1+7f4pc75ENMJAxUdbDIzonSMWYoGRsiExjJMXbqYJRN5HAekP5KRgVJQEltp7+KEpXM3MVhO2//UZczDUTz0mfmKdgec7YyGMhZLeepOwxOlkwKdbMRjQie1xrY98ZEcdfXOg4crz7rHN6MBGMGeQ6J1pG9DwaXkUppnSvX5xRzTPc+UnyuhSJP1pS3B71Egdj3DNLoqobyaB+tT9ThEgEqbFtn2DN/qJFbmr05vu7jHbx3epaTPPEEGM/UZbiYIZu7bGV58ZnWolo+d+5WETqFwRXTvPkjlj3RFg2iCFRnGfO6xO+uo6aqmFdgZC9nO6Rf+d2XlLO9MHD28edFRw3ZhQbepy+cfrE+giMuczD/GEwTI6SgNSYEqvNSzRzKrEq7/LSA9s0m9tDeUyinaJmbK2ZDtb9YUH3uxtEH3B508MqA+OlAdOp+j0WuoubFjJFSqoIeEL7KZFQSK4z1e22T5Fu/pKIzoERJv5OrWiHph36zBIzjBsVExrDtOHWdMCdNzANYXaKNNk5JOVmNfu08f3gf4X9KyzNhqigSL33yJaYlQhdeAr0Zxf0gvhIi4yuiEgY3DwTFprItCRIb+3vBtTDlLttzGQvvW/CXCYvUJ+7unJppQ4OnEp8zUAlcZUB2GzvZHVcbCVD54UX9sJzqUPvNx3RUpQyE0dfd4B2aX7VffDeO+UoFoIh1Ff5NWdKFlk8VpH4HMOMjKxILMQR/LdYD+FtY4QBu/+f8dRmOZuI0mme1yDz/KC6aOISAmXaNvgZ+A0c3LeiUcHh/J09CCmXpRwD65I2j9XPmmzL9HpyoNDT8pZ000WYl1IN1zvU6ksvXKyR2TgjsbNte8VllbuinGYvEu+f1Wr/KN7HXjEUW8WMegPu97Nn2wC1nkKN/WF8FnOVT0VMGlKFZMJRGVugRuWrVcRN10zpxAPDi8GF4jrKYC1ZQQsbIgbisGhZxTUmuwZKCF8y5HU+TZOlDbujqFfWBsh/9YReJvoyy6PEF8lcs8/am+OEBDuWChEqK6HRGBpyfn9q5wt2eoBOp2zhDVRZI97jIflVdG6YLzgxbMsf4w01f30eih00GHzjlCo35CBfxamx3g7EydKBpA2K4UofGPBYeHk6RN8eYFUi77VYDEm/DY48pSCL1SGa1iCFXKTv+QtJSRs+MxvRilM+EPBZgbTYHXkvWDH+ENYkBBA5n36uN177omO51IFFPJUaMFCOuWtUTjrYMyPRjQ6ouYhW+JBkudCKfhUdBm1F1yKvq7aPcEM9NvIQFXGo+j6nrx5OJK7M1SBN3E31jRJ4MoCpRX5qo48iANcEgKDJ+rS4tqEbmSDnXqX/KlFkUJ70sjP/wLSpxx4WSe5pc0C6rbQmHz89hcwox7sC01FkbquFw1thy3zfQiugfHU49SGTy09la5RoZ2cT0O/OsGy/xLY9C3BOPlWLDBiDDS9Su4N7bE0kpOJlc8pH/FV5gu7s02+2FR9+ZunDa9hjix0SsHfPVW0XJ6YJUk0u914aqrq2HM6QXCZxZIG35ANdWoks4khYqhBdhkKTFqrldLrpUG/+VwGZNb8RUqFzhHcHlWenJ8OczL6vj6xd6bNJ8JK/OuhUxrhZWE3li2W7Wwu3yuTPgjutaZw1Ub0OYCd+xZGvKin4FRup/zDMba0ltuSHBe/4iOmqiWB9fmex3OEX0Zkn6f11gf8kj/YmAOtWcGdnT0XcAIMY7R3TJ1beE7pCdLY4FSTNSSUtyN9w0jsen/rq8D32UfjH0BSYx5/Jm6vn6NBWKafXQ4G9c1l8JVrjQPUQqmMvl0YMmwI9PSbp2mO+XJNKKqzyBcFR2+LyA1/DoxvvFGvGIuB45/UljczhMGDMeJM97mIRg6YeXku0mVB6WDg0nDBXZnIchiHXG8jnOfacGB7lV2LMlqdb9bWa0QUh1v9EqcZdBOC5c5yj44s/oIsMGSuuis7zb2HVKdjI4uvOeAfPyUQWoUdwL1aSIqhZG6YvRBtIsynBFnku4r0AGFXofI3tMQEYNUvs/fPEhFWIpisDZ6soyEG6lHrDow6ZlzE59590fbUunHOquIMRGP1RTuUNrBBw2yPpC8PRdCDEf4DglI0TGo5u+xX7Yg3uJSav5zjNXWJNfSCEyQlIfchJUTFYWS8kEYunwBQJYNLAef9dRXckCjmZlsYFXshhi45dK/TtyJFg90yJkpMbLM1W1+SYfsqRCefF7FXaxXcfJT0L1nBWCSR2tACZuUQcPTgcC4CQiefT08IBb7t7RnkyExhqJy9gOJsd5L0hM8C9FHbITSuCovNlwWcFGkWr6kTgr+0xYc4JQIy5H6EPTd23Epyiy5dSnOP4aWfVvpDmdzEWRtupPVlg4IffVynQwQZI4PDnu/uRZ5L4WRLLGj7AMKXwQVAeRf0hRFsfB2Q0NJhdSoPRBm1NpAUuKc5GjfDPcybRDaVgBgA9QtnNHGsZCQgaT2p4k/BIqY2cTzyMyFzL1LEv317egnt7wEBV286VfBtjhQlyzCYNwUuoFVbm8iZIuSxTFJ53ShwwdX8uaqsTfJdeNEi14scBeu5XdOnCK16oDMKGtEHzjFv7Sri7ZkyonjdymAlMiJA4cJY6ElP+JcmbCA/WmuuWOvjFC9aP89ZssP9wt+dQBbEL+nLW1NjbPsAzh0+3OAziziZtdM10nvTYm/5xX8smHbtrC+EuL7SWnVbc6QnCFCBfLmOMQB6BjDrmAdx4/i/z0P051SerlzOtaORkcolylsPi1VNg0iW6MPj9GYtTUA3uPvDPoZ2pRq4SPUBihEzs09e1VF5d9Skb6d1QldQt+GoDq6fdLiUTCtuCiDLVYEurizpEvN7+gZLSvE85HQ3uF+n4EVdgxXcIqSuZQlsiYM2X2kUGGTeqkYfxk+PbYKiepyCGEWluRqWNLxy/FvanApwW8bzFPwIkxcE1xD1JLmcAJ/AoEcazj114s2ZAZnLP3z2AwiG98k2PAdevrQeD+MQOVVxNX417uwOhk7yIqb8m4IM/CaEuttK8BIIDeZzH4/b3k3L2rFej+LzOmBouSth4JOHUXCeZwKEzsCr2CpLQ9OnGyaaZGn4rv7eg4E6HSgj5r1BRuu0LHFixrEuRfrRGMuxLEUXm73kq7iunlQt2zu0bf3RpaSs7QqPPFPFhBe+AlTJ9BqJllZUtQZNw4meMwgoV4zTEbXP55QB+dn51ocrKwkXqg7cm6dL+4TYIsKyeCSZAgcQFRicvdwm3E8BsGJiEYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3515,"cache_read_input_tokens":34602,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3515,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"09df2512-2117-4556-8c34-62d62a4835ce","uuid":"1021c428-3133-4c48-ae2e-1917c9354ade"}
