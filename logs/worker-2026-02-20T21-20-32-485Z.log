This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly.

If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial test specification job into groups using `add-group`:\n\nFirst, add a group for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage groups for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one group per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --job \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n\n- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n\n- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n  interleave downloads and reads.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

[2026-02-20T21:19:35.936Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01FXesTPCxmJH4Y6yPw644K5","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have all the information I need. Let me systematically check each job:\n\n## Job 1: CheckTestSpecContactsListPage — Check testSpec.md directives in ContactsListPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n1. **Images consistency**: Prioritize consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to images.\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element**: Every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n3. **Do not substitute easier elements**: If a table has columns requiring joins/computed values, test for all. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four.\n\n\n4. **Every clickable element must specify exact navigation target or action result**: Don't leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For external flow buttons, specify how the flow opens.\n5. **User action that mutates data**: Write test entries verifying persistence and side effects (e.g., history/timeline entries created, only once).\n6. **Button and control appearance matters**: If mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling, verify appearance.\n7. **Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**.\n8. **Attachment functionality should support file uploads**.\n9. **Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format**: Required columns, accepted values, file type. Test entries should verify format documentation\n\nNow I'm going through the ContactsPageHeader test entries to validate them against these requirements. The header tests cover the page title and action buttons, the Add Contact modal with all its fields and controls, and contact creation with persistence verification. Checking these against the directives, particularly around import/upload format documentation visibility.\n\nThe Import button is mentioned in the header tests but there's no dedicated test entry verifying the import dialog displays CSV format information before the user attempts to upload. Similarly, the Export button has no test entry confirming its action result. The Add Contact modal tests are incomplete too—there's no verification that the modal dialog itself functions properly beyond just opening and saving. These are clear gaps against the requirements for import/upload dialogs, clickable element navigation, and modal dialog testing. ContactsTable has a test for row navigation (CTLP-TBL-02), which is good. Moving to ContactsPagination — there's only a test for the count text (CTLP-PGN-01), but the Previous/Next buttons and page number links aren't covered. **VIOLATION** — pagination navigation controls are missing test entries.\n\nNow I'm noticing the test spec lists five components but doesn't include an import dialog, even though other pages like DealsListPage have import functionality tested. The ContactsListPage header should probably have import tests too, similar to the pattern I see elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the actual header description, it mentions Import, Export, and Add Contact buttons—all interactive elements that need test coverage. The Export button is referenced in CTLP-HDR-01 but has no corresponding test entry for what happens when clicked. And the Import button is missing test entries entirely for opening the dialog, displaying CSV format information, and actually importing contacts. This violates the directive that every interactive element must be tested and that import dialogs must specify expected data formats.\n\nI also notice the Cancel button in the Add Contact modal has no test entry for closing it, and the pagination controls (Previous/Next buttons and page number links) are listed as features but completely lack test entries verifying their behavior. These are all violations of the requirement that every clickable element must have a test entry specifying its exact action or navigation result.\n\nNow I'm moving on to Job 2 to check what the writeApp.md directives say about the ContactsListPage components themselves. Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons, and attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Now I'm going through each component to verify they meet the requirements: ContactsPageHeader has proper testids on buttons and container, no native selects, and matches the test entries. ContactsSearchBar includes testids on the search input and clear button. ContactsTable has comprehensive testids across all columns and navigates correctly to individual contact pages. ContactsPagination covers all interactive elements with testids. AddContactModal... I'm checking whether the AddContactModal violates the directive about searchable selects for entity references — the spec doesn't require a client association field, so that's fine. Let me review the writeApp.md directives more carefully to see if there are any other issues I'm missing with the ContactsListPage implementation. Looking at the remaining directives, I need to verify that the contacts components satisfy all the test entry requirements—checking things like proper data-testids, no native selects, and correct visual elements. Let me work through each test case to confirm the implementation matches the spec. Pagination is working correctly. Now I'm checking the test directives in the writeTests.md file to ensure the ContactsListPage tests follow best practices—verifying navigation targets precisely, handling side effects properly, using consistent test IDs, and avoiding common testing pitfalls like getByText with generic words.\n\nGoing through each test case: the heading test uses specific role queries and test IDs appropriately. The add button test is next...\n\nActually, looking at CTLP-HDR-03, there's a potential issue with nested retry logic — wrapping `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` inside `.toPass()` creates double waits since the assertion already has built-in retry semantics, which could cause problems. single atomic assertion without the extra .toPass() wrapper. The test at line 59-61 violates this by nesting `toBeVisible()` inside `.toPass()`, when it should just use the timeout parameter directly on the matcher itself. Looking at the CTLP-SRCH-02 test now, I see it's using `.count()` outside of .toPass() which is fine, but I need to check the rest of that test for similar issues. Filling the search input with the first name looks good. The timeout isn't ideal, but it's not a directive violation. For the assertion on line 102, using `.getByText()` with a potentially common word like a first name could match unintended elements in the table due to substring matching — it's scoped to the contacts table which helps, but this is worth flagging as a minor concern depending on the actual data.\n\nFor CTLP-SRCH-03, the conditional check on the clear button using `isVisible()` isn't technically a violation since it's not inside a `.toPass()` block, though it could flake if the button appears after a delay. The fallback approach of clearing with `fill('')` is reasonable.\n\nIn CTLP-TBL-01, the row count check and conditional logic aren't direct violations either, but I'm noticing the test uses `getByText()` to find headers like 'Name' and 'Title', which could have similar substring matching issues. The test relies on at least one contact existing in the database, so it silently passes without testing anything if the database is empty. The directive says tests needing a pristine dataset should create their own records, and while this test doesn't depend on a fixed count, it does assume pre-existing data, which could be a problem for parallel test execution.\n\nSome tests like CTLP-HDR-03 do create their own data, but others just depend on seed data being available. This isn't necessarily a directive violation since the tests use conditional guards rather than asserting fixed counts, which respects the parallel test guidelines. Now I'm looking at the CTLP-PGN-01 test around line 171.\n\nThe test uses conditional visibility checks rather than assertions inside `.toPass()`, which is consistent with the pattern across other tests. Checking directive #8 about exercising specific fields: CTLP-HDR-03 fills in name, title, and email as described in the spec, and doesn't attempt to fill phone or location since those aren't mentioned. That checks out.\n\nFor Job 3 violations, I'm finding that CTLP-HDR-03 has an issue with `.toPass()` wrapping an auto-wait assertion on lines 59-61.\n\nLooking more closely at CTLP-SRCH-02, the `getByText()` call with the firstName variable could potentially match multiple elements in the table if that name appears in other fields, which violates the directive about avoiding common words as substrings. The table is filtered beforehand, so it's somewhat mitigated, but it's still a potential issue.\n\nNow I'm checking for other violations like additional `.toPass()` issues and `waitForTimeout` usage, though the guidelines don't explicitly prohibit the latter.\n\nLooking at the test entries for CheckTestSpecContactsListPage, I'm finding several gaps: the Import button lacks test coverage for the dialog opening and CSV format documentation, the Export button has no test entry for its action, and the Cancel button in AddContactModal isn't tested either.\n\nThe pagination controls—Previous/Next buttons and page numbers—are documented in the Components section but missing corresponding test entries. These violations stem from incomplete coverage of interactive elements and missing navigation/action specifications.\n\nCheckComponentsContactsListPage passes all checks with proper data-testids and no native select usage. However, CheckTestsContactsListPage has an issue where CTLP-HDR-03 nests an auto-wait mechanism inside `.toPass()`, which creates problematic double-waiting behavior.\n\nI need to organize fixes into groups: one for adding the missing test spec entries to cover the Import dialog, Export action, Cancel modal, and pagination navigation, and another for correcting the nested auto-wait pattern in the contacts test file. I need to be more thorough here—adding test spec entries means I also need to write the actual Playwright tests and make sure the app code supports what I'm documenting. Let me reorganize into two groups: one for the missing test spec violations that requires adding documentation, writing tests, and verifying they pass, and another for the nested .toPass() issue. I'm organizing these into two focused groups based on the strategy—one for adding the missing test spec entries with their corresponding Playwright tests, and another for fixing the nested `.toPass()` auto-wait issue by switching to `toBeVisible` with an explicit timeout
