Do not simplify the visual design.\n    55→\n    56→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    57→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    58→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    59→\n    60→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    61→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    62→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    63→  functions directory incorrectly.

Each\n    83→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    84→  to the same destination.\n    85→\n    86→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    87→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    88→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    89→\n    90→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    91→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    92→  icon for all attachment types.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    95→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    96→\n    97→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    98→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Never remove these settings.\n   117→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   118→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   119→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   120→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   121→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   122→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   123→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   124→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   125→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   126→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   127→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   128→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   129→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   130→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   131→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   132→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   133→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   134→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   135→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   136→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   137→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   138→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   139→\n   140→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   141→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   142→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   143→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   144→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   145→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ce96ea08-e9ba-4961-b444-324333c4877e","uuid":"33ab4b98-77ec-471f-bb0d-49758e4f5a80","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

The layout includes category headers with expandable/collapsible lists or sections of accounts belonging to each category. Each account row or card shows at least the account name and may include summary information such as current balance, total debits/credits, and budget vs actual summary. Each account entry is clickable, taking the user to a detailed account view page showing all transactions for that account. There is also a prominent 'New Transaction' button on this page that opens functionality to record a transaction and specify the affected accounts. The page additionally provides access (e.g., via navigation or buttons) to generate and view reports.

The layout consists of the account name and category (asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense) at the top, followed by a transaction list or ledger. Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n    12→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n    13→\n    14→3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n    15→   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n    16→   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n    17→\n    18→4.

This gives the UI an approachable, earthy feel without sacrificing professionalism.\n   352→3. **Subdued forest green accent**: The accent color `#4d7c5e` is muted and natural — it should feel like a walk through a pine forest, not a traffic light. Use it sparingly for selections, primary actions, and active states.\n   353→4. **Subtle interactivity**: Hover states use near-transparent warm overlays (`rgba(50, 45, 35, 0.06)`) rather than bold color changes.\n   354→5. **Consistent rounding**: 4px radius is the default for all controls; larger radii reserved for containers.\n   355→6. **Light shadows**: Shadows are used sparingly with warm-tinted low-opacity values for a flat-but-layered feel.\n   356→7. **Fast transitions**: Hover and focus transitions are quick (0.1s–0.15s) for a responsive feel.\n   357→8. **Inter Variable font**: Uses the variable-weight version of Inter allowing smooth font-weight variations (e.g., 450 for semi-light nav items).\n   358→9. **Compact density**: Nav items and buttons are 28px tall with tight padding for information-dense layouts.\n   359→10. **Green as a highlight, not a flood**: The forest green should appear in focused moments — active nav items, primary buttons, selected rows, focus rings — not as large background fills. The UI should read as warm gray with green punctuation.\n   360→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_018WvLgxmv6BRXow8vgwHvuv","session_id":"ce96ea08-e9ba-4961-b444-324333c4877e","uuid":"82ac514d-6b95-4962-9f8b-f9fd46bc542c"}

See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n    11→* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n    12→* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n    13→* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n    14→  the work currently being done.\n    15→\n    16→You are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\n    17→external services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n    18→\n    19→**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n    20→\n    21→1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n    22→   whose name matches the user's request.\n    23→2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n    24→3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n    25→   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n    26→\n    27→Do NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\n    28→matching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n    29→\n    30→## Worker Execution\n    31→\n    32→The worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\n    33→it passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n    34→\n    35→- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n    36→- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n    37→\n    38→The worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\n    39→subtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n    40→\n    41→When you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n    42→\n    43→## Task System\n    44→\n    45→Work is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\n    46→with a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\n    47→a `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n    48→\n    49→```json\n    50→{\n    51→  \"tasks\": [\n    52→    {\n    53→      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n    54→      \"subtasks\": [\n    55→        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    56→        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n    57→        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n    58→      ],\n    59→      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    60→      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    61→    }\n    62→  ]\n    63→}\n    64→```\n    65→\n    66→The agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n    67→\n    68→* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n    69→  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n    70→  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n    71→  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n    72→  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n    73→\n    74→All subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\n    75→all checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\n    76→sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n    77→\n    78→**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n    79→\n    80→- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n    81→  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n    82→- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n    83→  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n    84→- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n    85→  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n    86→  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n    87→- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n    88→\n    89→## Tech Stack\n    90→\n    91→- **Vite** for build tooling\n    92→- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n    93→- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n    94→- **Redux** for client side state management\n    95→- **shadcn/ui** for components\n    96→- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n    97→- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n    98→- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n    99→\n   100→## Database\n   101→\n   102→All database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\n   103→and operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\n   104→frontend components.\n   105→\n   106→## Quality Gates\n   107→\n   108→Before each commit, run `npm run check` (see `skills/scripts/check.md`).

KEY PATTERNS & CONVENTIONS\n\n**Redux patterns:**\n- Use async thunks for API calls\n- Slice reducers handle state updates\n- useAppDispatch/useAppSelector hooks for typed access\n\n**Component patterns:**\n- Functional components with React hooks\n- useState for local state, Redux for shared state\n- data-testid attributes throughout for testing\n- Event handlers with e.stopPropagation() for nested interactions\n\n**Styling:**\n- CSS modules or imported CSS files\n- CSS custom properties for theming\n- Class names follow BEM convention (e.g., `.account-card`, `.account-card-header`)\n- Warm, muted color palette (forest green accents)\n\n**API patterns:**\n- Netlify functions at `/.netlify/functions/<resource>`\n- RESTful endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n- JSON request/response bodies\n\n**Routing:**\n- React Router v6 with Routes/Route\n- Catch-all route redirects to /accounts\n- URL params: `/accounts/:id`, `/reports/:id`\n\n---\n\n## 11. PAGES TO IMPLEMENT\n\nThe following pages have placeholder implementations:\n\n1. **AccountDetailPage** - Complete with:\n   - Account header with breadcrumb\n   - Budget overview section\n   - Transactions tab (ledger view)\n   - Budget details tab (line item breakdown)\n   - Reporting links\n\n2. **DashboardPage** - Summary view of accounts and recent activity\n\n3. **ReportListPage** - List of generated reports with summary\n\n4. **ReportDetailsPage** - Full report display with tables/charts\n\n5. **BudgetsPage** - Budget management interface\n\n---\n\nThis is a comprehensive accounting application with double-entry bookkeeping, budget tracking, and reporting capabilities. All the foundation code, types, Redux slices, and design system are in place. You have everything needed to build out the remaining pages and components!"}],"totalDurationMs":62459,"totalTokens":73175,"totalToolUseCount":44,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3909,"cache_read_input_tokens":64625,"output_tokens":4634,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3909},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Budget information is visible or accessible for each account, including an overall budget for the account and budgets for specific items (for example, big or notable expenses), potentially displayed as inline indicators or links to more detailed budget views.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdjq4Pw1UektSnylW57BEZobPcKpDY4LHifIMz\n\n2. AccountDetailPage (N/A)\n   Description: A detailed view page for a single account that shows all transactions that have affected that account. The layout consists of the account name and category (asset, liability, equity, revenue, or expense) at the top, followed by a transaction list or ledger. Each transaction row shows date, description, amount, direction (debit/credit or increase/decrease), and possibly links to view or edit the full transaction. The page includes the 'New Transaction' button to record a new transaction that may affect this account along with others. Budget information for this account is displayed, including an overall budget and more granular budgets for specific items or sub-items (such as big expenses). There may be summary sections or charts comparing actual vs budgeted amounts for this account. Navigation or links from this page allow the user to access reporting features related to the account, including reports showing actual vs budgeted figures.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kdafog7fsZerSd1Lm2DGRPkh67qwvt8psn5jbf\n\n3. NewTransactionModal (N/A)\n   Description: A modal dialog or dedicated interface opened via the 'New Transaction' button from the accounts or account detail views. This modal allows the user to record a new transaction and specify the affected accounts. The layout includes fields such as transaction date, description, amount(s), and a mechanism (e.g., line items) to select multiple accounts with their respective debit or credit amounts. Validation ensures the transaction is balanced across accounts. Submission saves the transaction and updates the associated account balances and reports. The modal likely includes controls to cancel or confirm the transaction and may offer basic categorization or tagging in line with the account structure. The primary functionality is to create new financial transactions that will appear in account transaction lists and be reflected in reports and budget comparisons.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8Kd5VXYn9tw0Ld4cHmvg86S39TjoGK5BDAsYF7R\n\n4. CreateReportDialog (N/A)\n   Description: A dialog to specify a report based on the accounts and their transactions. The layout likely includes controls or filters for selecting report type (e.g., summary, detailed, category-based), date ranges, and which accounts or categories (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) to include. The page also provides functionality to refresh or regenerate reports based on new parameters and may link back to specific account detail pages when users click on report items. Budget versus actual comparisons are a core feature of these reports.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KdH0QZwUJBicXIxYl7ANfnRyzLoKQCwtb1e8Wj\n\n5. ReportDetails (/reports/:id)\n   Description: Details about the contents of a generated report.  The page displays reports that compare actual results to budgeted amounts, both at the account level and potentially at the specific-item level (e.g., big expenses). Reports may be shown as tables, charts, or both, highlighting variances between actual and budgeted figures.\n   Mockup: https://utfs.io/f/g4w5SXU7E8KduvOBXPH0NlcrvAhaRjg7E2zVpwb9xeY8LoBG\n\n6. ReportList (/reports)\n   Description: List of all generated reports and their top level info.  Here is the prompt for generating a report: A dialog to specify a report based on the accounts and their transactions. The layout likely includes controls or filters for selecting report type (e.g., summary, detailed, category-based), date ranges, and which accounts or categories (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) to include. The page also provides functionality to refresh or regenerate reports based on new parameters and may link back to specific account detail pages when users click on report items.

The CSS styling is complete in `index.css`\n\nNow I'm verifying that all the test requirements are met by cross-checking the existing implementation against the test specs for each component. I'm verifying the AccountsPage component implementation covers all the key requirements—CategoryGroup integration, proper data loading on mount, handling of loading and error states, an empty state display, and the correct responsive padding classes. Everything appears to be accounted for. Now let me check if there's an AppRevisions.md file to document these changes.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":12511,"cache_read_input_tokens":54867,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":12511,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ce96ea08-e9ba-4961-b444-324333c4877e","uuid":"9bcc7594-904f-4032-8429-90193bf98ced"}
