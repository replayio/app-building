Redundant\n    81→  cleanup wastes time and can cause tests to exceed their timeout under recording or CI overhead.\n    82→\n    83→- For assertions that depend on backend round-trips (auth flows, database writes, API calls),\n    84→  use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 30000 }`) rather than tight ones.

A tight timeout that barely passes locally will flake\n    87→  under load or recording.\n    88→\n    89→- For tests that chain multiple user flows in a single test (e.g., signup → signout → signin →\n    90→  verify), add `test.slow()` at the top of the test to triple the default timeout. Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    95→\n    96→- For deployment tests (tests run against a live deployed site rather than a local dev server):\n    97→  - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup. Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"4331c858-73a0-4189-b897-0a7ed26a30d7","uuid":"8bcb8b97-628f-4ce2-9df4-0a13f2142a22","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

The ActivityLog component and its data-testid values\n2. The existing test patterns in app-page.spec.ts\n3. The test specifications I need to implement\n\nLet me also check the test spec more carefully:\n\n**ActivityLog: Section title and layout** - The ActivityLog section is visible below AppActions, displays \"AI Development Activity Log\" heading in bold, has bordered container around log entries.\n\n**ActivityLog: Live Feed indicator for Building app** - For building app, shows \"Live Feed\" badge with green dot, text \"Live Feed - Historical View\" with green dot next to \"Live Feed\".\n\nWait, looking at the spec more carefully:\n\n\nThere's a discrepancy between what the spec describes and what the component actually renders. The spec says the label should read \"Live Feed - Historical View\" with a green dot next to \"Live Feed\", but the component code shows it only displays either \"Live Feed\" (when `isLive` is true) or \"Historical View\" (when false), not both together. I need to clarify whether the spec is describing the combined text incorrectly or if the component implementation doesn't match the intended design. I see the issue now—the spec actually calls for displaying both \"Live Feed\" and \"Historical View\" together as a single label, with the green dot positioned next to whichever one is currently active. The component is currently showing them separately, so I need to refactor it to display the combined text and adjust the indicator positioning accordingly. Let me also check the test coverage and other sections of the app to make sure everything aligns with this change. I need to check how the AppPage component integrates the activity log and implements the refresh functionality to ensure my test expectations align with the actual
