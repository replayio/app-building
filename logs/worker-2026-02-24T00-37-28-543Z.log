For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n    12→\n    13→Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n    14→\n    15→## Contacts Page\n    16→\n    17→A Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form. Clicking a contact row navigates to the PersonDetailPage at /individuals/:id. The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match.

The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"10aa1755-5c41-4e10-826a-4e5ecda700de","uuid":"9a748c1e-133b-4edd-95eb-6c2261570169","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page.

The error messages are specific enough for the user to correct the CSV.\n\n## TaskDetailPage (/tasks/:taskId)\n\n## ContactsListPage (/contacts)\n\n## SettingsPage (/settings)\n\n## UsersListPage - Team (/users)\n\n## UserDetailPage (/users/:userId)\n\n## ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password)\n\n## ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password)\n\n## ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email)\n","numLines":302,"startLine":1,"totalLines":302}}}
[2026-02-24T00:36:03.977Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01X7NkoUwEVLXnpVprFoSNvV","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I need to work on the job: \"PlanPageTaskDetail: Decide on TaskDetailPage components, add sections and test entries to docs/tests.md for TaskDetailPage\"\n\nI need to:\n1. Look at the TaskDetailPage spec from both AppSpec.md and AppRevisions.md\n2. Download and examine the mockup image if there is one\n3. Decide on the components for the TaskDetailPage\n4. Write test entries for all components\n5. Add groups for individual component test entries via add-group\n\nLet me check the AppSpec - there's no explicit TaskDetailPage in the original spec, but the AppRevisions.md mentions it:\n\n\nThe TaskDetailPage is at /tasks/:taskId and displays task details like title, priority, status, due date, assignee, and associated client/deal information. It includes a notes section where users can add and delete notes, with a task_notes database table and corresponding API endpoints. From this page, tasks can be marked complete or canceled. Since there's no mockup available, I'll structure the components based on the functionality: a TaskDetailHeader for the title and action buttons, and supporting components for the various task attributes and notes section.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the strategy for how to organize the planning work—I need to create one group per page that includes the page plan and all component plans, then add individual component planning jobs for each section. Looking at the actual job description more carefully, it seems like \"PlanPageTaskDetail\" is supposed to both decide on the components AND write out all the test entries in one go, rather than splitting it into separate component planning jobs like the strategy pattern suggests. That's different from how TasksListPage was structured, but that's what this job is asking for.\n\nSo I need to map out the TaskDetailPage components based on the text description in AppRevisions.md: TaskDetailHeader for the title and action buttons, TaskDetailInfo for the metadata like due date and assignee, TaskNotesSection for managing notes, and EditTaskModal for the editing interface. I should double-check whether EditTaskModal already exists elsewhere or if I'm creating it fresh. I'm settling on a component structure with TaskDetailHeader for the title and action buttons, TaskDetailInfo to display the due date, assignee, client, deal, and description, TaskNotesSection for managing notes with add and delete functionality, and EditTaskModal for the edit form. Now I need to write out the test cases to cover these components thoroughly. I see the job description explicitly asks for both sections and test entries in one go, which makes sense since TaskDetailPage lacks a mockup and the requirements are fully documented in text. Let me fill in the empty TaskDetailPage section with the components and their corresponding test entries.\n\nNow I'm listing out the test cases for each component—TaskDetailHeader needs to verify the title, badges, and button behaviors like navigation and status updates; TaskDetailInfo should test the metadata display and links; TaskNotesSection handles note management; and EditTaskModal covers the editing interface. I'll write comprehensive test entries for TaskDetailHeader first, covering the display of task information, badge rendering, button navigation, and status change functionality. completed or cancelled\n9. Cancel Task button not shown when task is already cancelled or completed\n\n### TaskDetailInfo\n\n1. Due date displayed with formatted date/time\n2. Assignee displayed with avatar and name (links to user detail)\n3. Client displayed with name (links to client detail page)\n4. Deal displayed with name (links to deal detail page)\n5. Description text displayed\n6. Missing optional fields show appropriate placeholder (e.g., no deal assigned)\n\n### TaskNotesSection\n\n1. Notes section displays existing notes in chronological order\n2. Each note shows content, author, and timestamp\n3. Add note form with text input and submit button\n4. Submitting a note adds it to the list\n5. Delete button removes a note\n6. Empty state when no notes exist\n\n### EditTaskModal\n\nThe edit modal opens with all current task data pre-filled, including title, description, due date, priority, client, and assignee fields. Title validation is required, and the priority, client, and assignee fields use dropdowns with search capabilities for easier selection.

I've done both - decided on 4 components (TaskDetailHeader, TaskDetailInfo, TaskNotesSection, EditTaskModal) and written comprehensive test entries for all of them.\n\nThe strategy pattern says that during PlanPages, I should add one group per page containing the page plan and component plans. But my job description already says \"add sections and test entries\" - meaning I should write the test entries directly, which I've done.\n\nLooking at the strategy pattern again:\n```\n--job \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\"\n\n\n```\n\nThese are supposed to be in ONE group. But my job already says \"add sections AND test entries\", which is essentially the combined job of PlanPage + PlanComponent jobs. So I don't think I need to add any sub-groups.\n\nAlso, per the AGENTS.md critical rules:\n> - You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt.\n> - When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n\nMy job description already encompasses both the planning and test entry writing, so I've completed what was assigned without needing to create additional job groups.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":215,"cache_read_input_tokens":43548,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":215,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"10aa1755-5c41-4e10-826a-4e5ecda700de","uuid":"0f2ae076-0cce-4d22-96b2-b1856d6ec1de"}
