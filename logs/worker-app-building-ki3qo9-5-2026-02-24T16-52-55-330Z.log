Per step 5 of the classification process: \"If the old test entries specify the correct behavior, the tests aren't covering it properly.

Looking more carefully at the test spec - it says \"When the user clicks 'Dashboard' in the sidebar\" then \"When the user clicks 'Deals' in the sidebar\". This is a sequential navigation flow starting from Clients. The test implies the sidebar should be present on Dashboard ... (truncated)\n\nWait - actually, let me reconsider whether this is about the app code (writeApp.md) or the tests (writeTests.md). The bug analysis says it's an APP problem.

Let me analyze:\n\n1. **Not a styling/UI bug** - The sidebar component wasn't rendered on non-Client pages. This is a functional problem.\n2. **Check old test entries at 8bbb1fd** - The \"Sidebar navigation links route to correct pages\" test specifies navigating from Clients → Dashboard → Deals → Tasks → Reports → Settings sequentially, implying the sidebar must be visible on all pages.\n3. **The old test entries specify the correct behavior** - The sidebar should be available for navigation on all pages. Per step 5, the problem stage is `writeTests.md` because the tests weren't properly covering this requirement (the test worked around the missing sidebar by using `page.goto('/clie...

Let me follow the classification steps:\n\n1. **Read the bug report** - The bug is about netlify.toml's catch-all `/* -> /index.html` redirect intercepting Vite dev server module requests, preventing React from mounting.\n\n2. **Is it a styling/UI bug?** - No, it's a netlify.toml infrastructure configuration issue.\n\n3. **It's a functional problem.** Looking at the test entries before the fix (at revision 8bbb1fd), the sidebar tests specify correct behavior (sidebar should display, navigation links should work).\n\n4. **Do old test entries specify the buggy behavior?** - No, they specify the correct behavior.\n\n5. **Do old test entries specify the correct behavior?** - Yes, they do. The tests also correctly catch the failure (they fail when the sidebar doesn't render because the app can't mount).\n\nHowever, the step 5 conclusion — \"the tests aren't covering it properly → writeTests.md\" — doesn't match. The tests DO cover this correctly; they fail when the app doesn't mount. The problem is purely in app infrastructure configuration (netlify.toml), and the test system caught it as designed.\n\nSince the strategy notes \"Some bugs do not have problem stages,\" and this is a configuration error that was correctly caught by existing tests, I'll classify this as **no problem stage**.\n\nAlso, the fix doesn't change app behavior — it fixes dev server configuration.

Let me follow the classification steps:\n\n1. **Read the bug report** - The bug is about netlify.toml's catch-all `/* -> /index.html` redirect intercepting Vite dev server module requests, preventing React from mounting.\n\n2. **Is it a styling/UI bug?** - No, it's a netlify.toml infrastructure configuration issue.\n\n3. **It's a functional problem.** Looking at the test entries before the fix (at revision 8bbb1fd), the sidebar tests specify correct behavior (sidebar should display, navigation links should work).\n\n4. **Do old test entries specify the buggy behavior?** - No, they specify the correct behavior.\n\n5. **Do old test entries specify the correct behavior?** - Yes, they do. The tests also correctly catch the failure (they fail when the sidebar doesn't render because the app can't mount).\n\nHowever, the step 5 conclusion — \"the tests aren't covering it properly → writeTests.md\" — doesn't match. The tests DO cover this correctly; they fail when the app doesn't mount. The problem is purely in app infrastructure configuration (netlify.toml), and the test system caught it as designed.\n\nSince the strategy notes \"Some bugs do not have problem stages,\" and this is a configuration error that was correctly caught by existing tests, I'll classify this as **no problem stage**.\n\nAlso, the fix doesn't change app behavior — it fixes dev server configuration. AppRevisions.md (which doesn't exist) doesn't need to be created.\n\nLet me update bugReports.md with the classification.\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md\n[TodoWrite]\n**Job 2: UpdateDirectives** - The strategy says: \"If no problem stage was identified for the bug report, skip this job.\" Since no problem stage was identified, skipping this job.\n[TodoWrite]\n**Job 3: FinishBug** - Move the SidebarNotRendering report from \"Unreviewed\" to \"Finished\".\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md\nLet me verify the final state of the file.\n[read] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md\nLet me clean up the extra blank line.\n[edit] /repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/bugReports.md\n[TodoWrite]\nAll three jobs are complete:\n\n1. **ClassifyBug**: Classified SidebarNotRendering as having **no problem stage** — it's an infrastructure configuration error in netlify.toml where the catch-all SPA redirect intercepted Vite dev server module requests.

Let me update my todo list and write the remaining 5 analysis files. Let me summarize the remaining logs:\n\nLog 6 (worker-2026-02-24T01-37-05-389Z.log): CheckTestSpec/CheckComponents/CheckTests for ClientsListPage directives. Found violations: testSpec (2 missing cancel tests), writeApp (component root margins), writeTests (toPass with auto-wait, delete test missing pagination count assertion). Queued fix groups. No test failures.\n\nLog 7 (worker-2026-02-24T01-39-06-104Z.log): FixViolation to replace .toPass() with atomic assertions and add pagination count assertion. \n\nLog 8 had a database auth issue that prevented tests from running initially, but after the margin fix was applied to move styles from component CSS to parent layout, the test suite executed with pagination and table tests passing completely while search-and-filters had 4 pre-existing failures unrelated to the changes. Looking at the logs more carefully, the agent didn't use Replay to debug those pre-existing failures in log 8 — they just verified the issues were unrelated to their changes and continued. Logs 7 and 9 had database authentication failures that prevented tests from running entirely, and log 10 has no tests yet since the page hasn't been built. The agent ran tests and encountered 4 failures in the search-and-filters spec, but these were pre-existing issues unrelated to the CSS margin changes they were implementing, so they didn't pursue debugging them with Replay. I need to locate the specific changeset revision and failing test identifiers from the logs to complete the template fields. For log 8, I need to count the actual test failures shown in the output—4 distinct failures across the search-and-filters tests, regardless of whether they're pre-existing issues that weren't introduced by this session's changes.\n\nFor logs 7 and 9, the database authentication failures prevented tests from running at all, so those are zero test failures.\n\nNow I'll write up the remaining analysis files with this
