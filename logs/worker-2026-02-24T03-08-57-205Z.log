OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   153→   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   154→   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   155→   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   156→   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   157→   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   158→   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   159→   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   160→   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n   161→3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   162→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   163→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   164→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   165→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   166→   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   167→   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n   168→4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   169→5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   170→   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   171→   making any changes.\n   172→6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   173→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   174→7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   175→   on what you found.\n   176→\n   177→### Bug Writeup Template\n   178→\n   179→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   180→\n   181→```\n   182→# Bug: <test name>\n   183→\n   184→## Step 1: Evidence\n   185→\n   186→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   187→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   188→no evidence.>\n   189→\n   190→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   191→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   192→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   193→\n   194→## Step 2: Determination\n   195→\n   196→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   197→\n   198→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   199→\n   200→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test.

Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   214→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   215→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   216→\n   217→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   218→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   219→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   220→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   221→\n   222→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   223→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   224→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   225→\n   226→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n   227→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n   228→\n   229→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   230→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   231→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   232→\n   233→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   234→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   235→\n   236→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   237→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   238→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   239→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   240→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   241→\n   242→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   243→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   244→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   245→\n   246→## Tips\n   247→\n   248→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   249→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   250→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   251→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   252→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   253→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   254→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   255→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   256→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   257→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   258→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   259→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   260→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   261→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   262→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   263→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   264→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   265→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   266→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   267→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   268→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   269→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   270→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   271→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   272→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   273→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   274→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   275→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   276→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   277→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   278→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   279→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   280→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   281→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   282→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   283→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   284→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   285→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   286→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   287→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   288→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   289→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0615c156-a36b-44d5-a27f-ee05da8b6b44","uuid":"99f141bf-42f2-49f0-81fe-b21d63856e98","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou will run all the tests in the app and get them to pass..\n\n## Unpack Sub-Groups\n\nUnpack the initial testing job into a single group:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"FixTests: Get all tests passing\"\n```\n\nAfter running tests and there are failures, pick specific failing tests and add a group to fix\nthem without regressing any tests that passed in previous runs:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"strategies/jobs/build/testing.md\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 1>\" \\\n  --job \"Fix: <failing test name 2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce all playwright tests have been written, you must get them to pass.\nWhen getting tests to pass, you must ensure the app is actually working.\nYou must not paper over problems in the app by hard-coding values,\ndisabling test functionality, and so on.\n\nYou might encounter bugs in the tests and can fix those, but you must ensure\nthat the test is correctly exercising the app as described in the corresponding\nentry in tests.md\n\nYou MUST read these skill files before testing.\n\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-cli/SKILL.md\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/replayio/skills/refs/heads/main/skills/replay-mcp/SKILL.md\n\nRECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY is already set in the environment for using the Replay CLI.\n\n## Replay.io Playwright Installation and Configuration\n\nEvery app MUST use the Replay browser to record Playwright test runs. This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@replayio/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `replayReporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx replayio install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.replay/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `replayReporter` and `devices as replayDevices` from `@replayio/playwright`.\n2. Include `replayReporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`replayDevices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from '@replayio/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    replayReporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...replayDevices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx replayio list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx replayio list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx replayio upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx replayio upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx replayio remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. **Read the debugging guides** in `strategies/debugging/` to find the category matching your\n   failure. The guides describe which Replay MCP tools to use first and what to look for:\n   - `strategies/debugging/timeouts.md` — Test timeouts and stuck steps\n   - `strategies/debugging/race-conditions.md` — Flaky tests, parallel interference\n   - `strategies/debugging/component-rendering.md` — Empty DOM, components not mounting\n   - `strategies/debugging/network-and-api.md` — API errors, missing/wrong data\n   - `strategies/debugging/form-and-input.md` — Form validation, input interactions\n   - `strategies/debugging/seed-data.md` — Missing test data, count mismatches\n   - `strategies/debugging/README.md` — Quick reference table: symptom → starting tool\n3. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx replayio list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx replayio upload <id>`.\n4. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n5. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure, following the tool sequence from the relevant\n   debugging guide. Use as many tools as needed to understand what actually happened before\n   making any changes.\n6. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n7. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n\n- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n\n- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n\n- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `replayio record`\n  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@replayio/playwright` for recordings.\n\n- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n\n- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n\n- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n\n- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n\n## Tips\n\n- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__replay__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n  attempting to fix individual tests.\n- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n","numLines":289,"startLine":1,"totalLines":289}}}

I have gathered all the information you requested. Here's my comprehensive report:\n\n## Summary\n\nI found the TasksFilter component and tasks backend function, along with how \"Due Date\" filtering is implemented throughout the SalesCRM app.\n\n---\n\n## 1. TasksFilter Component\n\n**File Path:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TasksFilter.tsx`\n\n**Key Code Sections:**\n\nThe filter options array includes \"Due Date\" mapping to `'due_date'`:\n```typescript\nconst filterOptions = [\n  { label: 'All Fields', value: 'all' },\n  { label: 'Priority', value: 'priority' },\n  { label: 'Assignee', value: 'assignee' },\n  { label: 'Client', value: 'client' },\n  { label: 'Due Date', value: 'due_date' },\n]\n```\n\nThe component dispatches Redux actions:\n- `setFilterType(value)` - Sets the selected filter category (lines 45-49)\n- `setFilterText(localText)` - Sets the filter search text with a 200ms debounce (lines 31-35)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tasks Backend Function\n\n**File Path:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/tasks.ts`\n\n**Key Code Sections:**\n\nThe backend handles `due_date` in multiple ways:\n\n**Database queries** - Tasks are sorted by `due_date` (lines 87 and 97):\n```typescript\nORDER BY t.due_date ASC NULLS LAST, t.created_at DESC\n```\n\n**Create handler** - Accepts `due_date` parameter (lines 120, 124, 133):\n```typescript\nconst { title, description, client_id, deal_id, assignee, assignee_role, priority, due_date } = data\n```\n\n**Update handler** - Conditionally updates `due_date` (lines 154, 161, 172):\n```typescript\nconst skipDueDate = due_date === undefined\n// ...\ndue_date = CASE WHEN ${skipDueDate}::boolean THEN due_date ELSE ${due_date || null} END,\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The backend does NOT currently filter tasks based on the `filterType` or `filterText` parameters. The query string parameters are only checked for `client_id` filtering (line 77).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Filtering Logic in Frontend\n\n**File Path:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TasksList.tsx`\n\nThe filtering happens entirely on the client-side in the `filterTasks()` function (lines 139-162):\n\n```typescript\nfunction filterTasks(tasks: TaskRow[], filterType: string, filterText: string): TaskRow[] {\n  if (!filterText.trim()) return tasks\n  const q = filterText.toLowerCase()\n\n  return tasks.filter(task => {\n    switch (filterType) {\n      case 'priority':\n        return task.priority.toLowerCase().includes(q)\n      case 'assignee':\n        return (task.assignee || '').toLowerCase().includes(q)\n      case 'client':\n        return (task.client_name || '').toLowerCase().includes(q)\n      case 'due_date':\n        return formatDueDate(task.due_date).toLowerCase().includes(q)  // Filters by formatted date\n      case 'all':\n      default:\n        return (\n          task.title.toLowerCase().includes(q) ||\n          task.priority.toLowerCase().includes(q) ||\n          (task.assignee || '').toLowerCase().includes(q) ||\n          (task.client_name || '').toLowerCase().includes(q) ||\n          formatDueDate(task.due_date).toLowerCase().includes(q)\n        )\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\nFor \"Due Date\" filtering, it uses the `formatDueDate()` helper function which formats dates as \"Due: Today, 2:30 PM\", \"Due: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM\", or \"Due: Jan 15, 2026\".\n\n---\n\n## 4. Redux Store\n\n**File Path:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/tasksSlice.ts`\n\nThe store maintains:\n- `filterType: string` - Currently selected filter category\n- `filterText: string` - Current filter search text\n- When `setFilterType` is dispatched, `filterText` is reset to empty string (line 131)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a42f54b81d735bd14 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 25196\ntool_uses: 11\nduration_ms: 17643</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0615c156-a36b-44d5-a27f-ee05da8b6b44","uuid":"536e7389-ca4b-483a-8808-f5459e9339a5","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"In /repo/apps/SalesCRM, find:\n1.

Tasks Backend Function\n\n**File Path:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/netlify/functions/tasks.ts`\n\n**Key Code Sections:**\n\nThe backend handles `due_date` in multiple ways:\n\n**Database queries** - Tasks are sorted by `due_date` (lines 87 and 97):\n```typescript\nORDER BY t.due_date ASC NULLS LAST, t.created_at DESC\n```\n\n**Create handler** - Accepts `due_date` parameter (lines 120, 124, 133):\n```typescript\nconst { title, description, client_id, deal_id, assignee, assignee_role, priority, due_date } = data\n```\n\n**Update handler** - Conditionally updates `due_date` (lines 154, 161, 172):\n```typescript\nconst skipDueDate = due_date === undefined\n// ...\ndue_date = CASE WHEN ${skipDueDate}::boolean THEN due_date ELSE ${due_date || null} END,\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The backend does NOT currently filter tasks based on the `filterType` or `filterText` parameters. The query string parameters are only checked for `client_id` filtering (line 77).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Filtering Logic in Frontend\n\n**File Path:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/components/TasksList.tsx`\n\nThe filtering happens entirely on the client-side in the `filterTasks()` function (lines 139-162):\n\n```typescript\nfunction filterTasks(tasks: TaskRow[], filterType: string, filterText: string): TaskRow[] {\n  if (!filterText.trim()) return tasks\n  const q = filterText.toLowerCase()\n\n  return tasks.filter(task => {\n    switch (filterType) {\n      case 'priority':\n        return task.priority.toLowerCase().includes(q)\n      case 'assignee':\n        return (task.assignee || '').toLowerCase().includes(q)\n      case 'client':\n        return (task.client_name || '').toLowerCase().includes(q)\n      case 'due_date':\n        return formatDueDate(task.due_date).toLowerCase().includes(q)  // Filters by formatted date\n      case 'all':\n      default:\n        return (\n          task.title.toLowerCase().includes(q) ||\n          task.priority.toLowerCase().includes(q) ||\n          (task.assignee || '').toLowerCase().includes(q) ||\n          (task.client_name || '').toLowerCase().includes(q) ||\n          formatDueDate(task.due_date).toLowerCase().includes(q)\n        )\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\nFor \"Due Date\" filtering, it uses the `formatDueDate()` helper function which formats dates as \"Due: Today, 2:30 PM\", \"Due: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM\", or \"Due: Jan 15, 2026\".\n\n---\n\n## 4. Redux Store\n\n**File Path:** `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/src/store/tasksSlice.ts`\n\nThe store maintains:\n- `filterType: string` - Currently selected filter category\n- `filterText: string` - Current filter search text\n- When `setFilterType` is dispatched, `filterText` is reset to empty string (line 131)"}],"totalDurationMs":17643,"totalTokens":25196,"totalToolUseCount":11,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2602,"cache_read_input_tokens":21523,"output_tokens":1064,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2602},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me:\n\n1. Add the \"Filter by Due Date category\" test entry to `docs/tests.md` in the TasksFilter section, following the same pattern as Priority, Assignee, and Client filters.\n2. Add the corresponding Playwright test to `tasks-filter.spec.ts`.\n\nFor the test, the Due Date filtering works by matching against the formatted date string. The seed tasks in beforeAll don't set explicit due dates, so I need to either:\n- Create a task with a specific due date that I can search for\n- Or use an approach that works with whatever dates are set\n\nLet me look at the `formatDueDate` function more carefully to understand what kind of text we'd search for. \n\nI see the formatted output follows patterns like \"Due: Today, 2:30 PM\", \"Due: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM\", or \"Due: Jan 15, 2026\". I should create a task with a specific future date in the beforeAll hook and then filter by searching for part of that formatted date string, so I need to check how the API handles setting due_date when creating tasks.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1568,"cache_read_input_tokens":52659,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1568,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0615c156-a36b-44d5-a27f-ee05da8b6b44","uuid":"f3efe305-e72b-4fc8-9f23-b072ca181cc0"}

This could be a timing issue - Neon branches sometimes need a moment before they're ready to accept connections.\n\n\nI'll run the test again to see if this was just a transient connection issue.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":588,"cache_read_input_tokens":63760,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":588,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0615c156-a36b-44d5-a27f-ee05da8b6b44","uuid":"69d82846-f746-46a6-ba24-f8e3f390b337"}
