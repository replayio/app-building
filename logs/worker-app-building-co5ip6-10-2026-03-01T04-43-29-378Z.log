Add one task per page,\ncontaining all test entries for that page:\n\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry1>: Write test for <TestEntry1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry2>: Write test for <TestEntry2>\" \\\n  --subtask \"WriteTest<TestEntry3>: Write test for <TestEntry3>\"\n```\n\n## Guidelines\n\n- For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements and verifies that the app will behave as the user expects.\n- Do not run the playwright tests, but make sure that the test should pass and update the app code if necessary.\n- The title of the playwright test must match the title of the test entry.\n- If you discover parts of the app that haven't been fully implemented, you must finish implementation of the app.\n- Playwright tests and app components/pages must use data-testid to identify elements on the page.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Tests must verify navigation targets precisely — assert the URL or page content after a click, not just that a click handler exists. A link going to the wrong page is a common bug that only surfaces if the test checks where it actually lands.\n\n- When a test spec entry implies a component is available across multiple pages (e.g., a sequential navigation flow that clicks sidebar links after navigating away from the starting page), tests must interact with that component on each page it should appear on. Never use `page.goto()` to navigate back to a known page as a workaround for a missing component — this masks the bug instead of catching it. If the spec says \"click X in the sidebar\" after navigating to a different page, the test must click the sidebar on that page, not reload the original page first.\n\n- For actions that produce side effects (e.g. history entries, timeline updates), write assertions that verify both the primary effect and the side effect. Also assert the side effect happens exactly once — duplicate entries from redundant API calls are a common bug.\n\n- Avoid using `getByText()` with common words that may appear as substrings in other elements (labels,\n  options, buttons). Playwright's `getByText` is case-insensitive and uses substring matching by default.\n  Prefer `getByTestId` for precise element targeting, or use `getByRole`/`getByLabel` with exact matching.\n  A `strict mode violation: getByText(...) resolved to N elements` error means the selector is ambiguous —\n  never work around it with `.first()`, instead use a more specific selector like `getByTestId` or\n  `getByRole` with `{ exact: true }`.\n\n- All `data-testid` values used across all test files for the same component must be consistent. Before\n  writing cross-cutting tests that reference components tested in other spec files, read the existing\n  spec files to use the same testid values.\n\n- When the test spec entry describes file upload functionality (e.g., \"file picker opens\", \"select a\n  file to upload\"), the test must exercise actual file upload mechanics (e.g., Playwright's\n  `setInputFiles` on a file input). Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n\n- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n  deadlocks.

Let me systematically go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecStatusPage — Check testSpec.md directive violations in StatusPage test entries\n\nThe testSpec.md directives are:\n\n1. **Images consistency**: Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation/styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. **Systematically inventory every visible element**: Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one.\n   \n3. **Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements**: If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns.\n\n4. **For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result**: Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\n\n5. **For any user action that mutates data, verify persistence and side effects**: Write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly.\n\n6. **Button and control appearance matters**: If a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance.\n\n7. **Completely test that modal dialogs work properly**.\n\n8. **Attachment functionality should support file uploads**\n\n9. **Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format**.\n\n10. **Backend integrations**: must include complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI.\n\n11. **Apps that receive webhooks from external services**: must include a webhook help/documentation UI. Test entries should verify that the help UI is accessible via a clearly labeled button, displays accurate documentation for each webhook endpoint, uses the actual site URL in examples, and provides working copy buttons.\n\n12. **For apps that expose backend API endpoints**: test specification must include entries that verify the endpoints actually function correctly.\n\n13. **State-changing actions must have tests that other parts of the app update appropriately**.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the StatusPage test entries against these requirements, starting with the BackLink component.\n\nBackLink navigates to the MainPage at \"/\" when clicked. For DefaultPromptDisplay, I'm checking that it displays the section title, shows the configured prompt text, and handles the empty state with a placeholder. ActiveContainers has a comprehensive set of tests covering the table display with proper columns, individual container details like name and status with styling, prompt information with fallback dashes for missing values, timestamps, and the empty state when no containers exist.\n\nNow I'm verifying WebhookEventFeed displays its section title, renders event items with timestamps and container IDs, shows event type and payload summaries, and handles the empty state. WebhookHelpButton should be visible on the StatusPage, open and close its help panel on interaction, and display documentation for both the app-builder-event and spawn-container endpoints.\n\nThe help panel needs to show the set-default-prompt endpoint documentation as well, with accurate curl commands using the actual site URL and copy-to-clipboard buttons for both the commands and endpoint URLs themselves. entries should verify that the help UI is accessible via a clearly labeled button, displays accurate documentation for each webhook endpoint, uses the actual site URL in examples, and provides working copy buttons.\"\n\nThe test entries cover:\n- ✓ Accessible via clearly labeled button: \"WebhookHelpButton: Visible on StatusPage\"\n- ✓ Opens/closes panel: \"WebhookHelpButton: Opens help panel on click\", \"Closes help panel\"\n- ✓ Accurate documentation for each endpoint: Three entries for the three endpoints\n- ✓ Uses actual site URL: \"WebhookHelpButton: Curl commands use actual site URL\"\n- ✓ Working copy buttons: \"WebhookHelpButton: Curl copy buttons exist\", \"WebhookHelpButton: Endpoint URL copy buttons exist\"\n\nFor apps exposing backend API endpoints, I need to verify the endpoints actually work. The \"ActiveContainers: Shows pending container after spawn\" test covers the spawn-container endpoint, but I'm missing tests that confirm the app-builder-event endpoint and set-default-prompt endpoint are functional—I need entries that POST to each and verify the expected side effects occur. Looking at the directives more carefully, I need to verify that clickable elements have specific navigation targets and that modal interactions are fully tested. The WebhookHelpButton and BackLink are covered, but the webhook help panel itself is missing a test case—I should check if there's coverage for dismissing it by clicking outside the panel or if only the close button is tested. the test spec actually validates that they work end-to-end. I'm realizing the main gaps are around backend verification and some UI state transitions that aren't explicitly covered in the test entries. their documentation or help UI is accurate.\" Currently there are no test entries for:\n   - POST to `app-builder-event` endpoint and verifying the event appears in WebhookEventFeed\n   - POST to `set-default-prompt` endpoint and verifying the prompt changes in DefaultPromptDisplay\n\n   The `spawn-container` endpoint is partially covered by \"ActiveContainers: Shows pending container after spawn\" which describes spawning via the POST endpoint and verifying the container appears.\n\n2. **Missing test entry for closing the help panel by clicking outside**: The code supports closing by clicking the overlay, and the \"Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\" directive suggests this should be tested. However, this is more minor.\n\nActually, let me reconsider #1. Looking at the test entry more carefully:\n\n\"ActiveContainers: Shows pending container after spawn\" does verify the endpoint working by posting to spawn-container and checking the result on StatusPage, so that's covered. But I'm missing equivalent tests for the other two endpoints—when an event is posted to app-builder-event, it should appear in WebhookEventFeed, and when a new prompt is set via set-default-prompt, it should show up in DefaultPromptDisplay. These are clear gaps in the endpoint testing coverage.\n\nNow moving on to check the components themselves.\n\nNow I'm examining the StatusPage components to verify they follow the writeApp.md directives. I need to check for data-testid attributes on interactive elements, containers, and list items, and verify the test entries match what's actually implemented. Continuing through the component test IDs—DefaultPromptDisplay and ActiveContainers both have solid coverage, though I notice some non-interactive elements like headings don't have testids, which is fine since they're not user-facing controls.\n\nWebhookEventFeed looks well-instrumented with testids on the container, empty state, individual items, and the various event details like timestamp and payload. WebhookHelpButton has a testid on the button itself, and I'm checking what else might need coverage there. I've verified all the test IDs are properly applied throughout the webhook help overlay and its components, including the endpoints, copy buttons, and curl code blocks. The padding directive is also correctly implemented with the CSS matching the Tailwind specifications for desktop and mobile breakpoints.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the component files themselves have any outer padding or margin that might violate the layout-agnostic principle, and I need to verify that background functions are being used for any long-running operations like spawning containers.\n\nLooking at the WebhookHelpButton component, I notice the curl command templates use `YOUR_SITE` as a placeholder, and there's a `resolveCurl` function that replaces it with `window.location.host` to get the actual site URL—which matches what the test spec requires.\n\nBut there's a protocol mismatch: the curl template hardcodes `https://`, while `window.location.host` only provides the hostname without protocol. On a local dev server running over `http`, this would incorrectly produce `https://localhost:8888` instead of `http://localhost:8888`. The `fullPath` for URL copying correctly uses `window.location.origin` (which includes protocol), so there's an inconsistency between how the two features construct the URL.\n\nThe test regex accepts both `http` and `https`, which masks this issue in development, but the hardcoded `https://` in the curl template is technically incorrect for local dev environments—though it would be correct in production. I see the curl replacement is using `window.location.host` which strips the protocol, so in development where the origin is `http://localhost:8888`, the hardcoded `https://` prefix creates a mismatch—the curl command would try to use `https://localhost:8888` instead of `http://localhost:8888`. This works fine in production but is a bug in dev environments. It's worth noting but not a directive violation, so let me shift focus to checking the component CSS against the layout-agnostic requirement from the style guide. carefully at the directive, I need test entries that verify endpoints actually function—not just documentation. The `spawn-container` endpoint gets partial coverage through the \"Shows pending container after spawn\" test, but `app-builder-event` and `set-default-prompt` have no functional test entries at all. There's also a `status` endpoint that's mocked in tests but lacks an explicit entry verifying it works.\n\nThe `status` endpoint is read-only though, so that's less critical than the state-changing ones. For the modal testing, the webhook help panel covers open/close via button but misses the overlay click scenario. Now let me check the components subtask—StatusPage has proper data-testid coverage, correct padding, and no native selects. I should review the CSS files to verify the layout-agnostic directive is being followed.\n\nLooking at the test file, I see tests for spawning containers, curl command URL replacement, and copy button functionality. But comparing against the spec in docs/tests.md, there are quite a few gaps—tests for BackLink visibility and navigation, DefaultPromptDisplay sections and text rendering, and broader ActiveContainers coverage are all missing from the Playwright suite.\n\nThe spec also calls for tests around WebhookEventFeed display and empty states, WebhookHelpButton visibility and panel interactions, and various other component behaviors that aren't currently implemented in the test file.\n\nLooking at the writeTests.md guidelines, I need to ensure tests verify navigation targets precisely, avoid generic text selectors, keep test IDs consistent, and be careful with auto-wait semantics. The existing tests are using getByTestId which is good, but there's a lot of coverage missing.\n\nI'm noticing the curl commands test has a potential issue with how it's iterating through elements—the pattern of querying and then looping through results could cause problems if the DOM changes between the count check and the iteration. I'm realizing the directive specifically targets `.toPass()` blocks, and since this test doesn't use that pattern, it's not technically a violation. But I'm noticing a much bigger issue: most of the test entries from the documentation don't have corresponding Playwright tests at all—24 out of 28 are missing. That said, the directive compliance check is about how tests are written, not whether they exist. Let me focus on what the directives actually require and re-examine them carefully.\n\nLooking through the full list of directives, they cover specifics like navigation verification, component availability across pages, side effect assertions, avoiding common text selectors, consistent data-testid usage, actual file upload mechanics, locator placement in retry blocks, state cleanup practices, timeout handling, test.slow() for complex flows, skill file locations, and deployment test patterns.\n\nFor the existing tests, the \"ActiveContainers: Shows pending container after spawn\" test uses route mocking and data-testid selectors with generous timeouts, which aligns with the guidelines. However, there's a gap between what the spec describes—actually POSTing to the spawn-container endpoint—and what the test does, which is mocking the status response to show a pending container. The test validates UI display rather than the actual endpoint behavior, creating a mismatch with the spec's intent.\n\nLooking at the writeTests directive more closely, the test should verify the app behaves as the user expects by actually triggering the endpoint and confirming the container appears, not just mocking the result. test entry requires spawning via POST, but the test uses mocking instead. So the test doesn't match the entry's requirements.\n\nFor the writeTests directive check, I should focus on the directives section, not the guidelines section. Let me re-focus.\n\nFor the writeTests directives applied to the existing tests:\n1. **Navigation target verification**: The \"Shows pending container after spawn\" test verifies UI content after navigating, not a navigation action. N/A. But the BackLink tests (which don't exist) would need to verify URL after click.\n2. **getByText avoidance**: The tests don't use getByText improperly. ✓\n3. **No .toPass() with auto-wait**: Tests don't use .toPass(). ✓\n4. **No unnecessary cleanup**: No beforeEach hooks. ✓\n5. **Generous timeouts**: Tests use 10000-15000ms timeouts. ✓\n\nThe massive gap of 24 missing tests is significant, but the directive check is really about whether existing tests violate the rules, not whether all entries have tests yet. I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify what I actually need to do: systematically check all StatusPage test entries against testSpec.md directives, all StatusPage component files against writeApp.md directives, and continue through the remaining checks. Now I'm examining the CSS files to verify whether the component layout directives are being

The CSS has styles for `--starting`, `--alive`, `--finished`, but the test spec mentions \"pending\" status (from \"Shows pending container after spawn\"). But in the CSS, there's no `active-containers__status--pending` class. Let me check if this matters...\n\nIn ActiveContainers.tsx line 34:\n```tsx\n<span className={`active-containers__status active-containers__status--${container.status}`}>\n```\n\nIf the status is \"pending\", it would generate `active-containers__status--pending`, but there's no matching CSS class. The test entry says \"Shows container status with styling\" with \"a styled status badge.\" This means the \"pending\" status wouldn't get proper styling - it would just get the base `.active-containers__status` styles (padding, border-radius, font-size, font-weight) but no background/color. Other statuses also mentioned in the test entries... \"started\" is in the spec but there's no `--started` CSS class either. The CSS has `--starting`, `--alive`, `--finished`.\n\nWait, let me re-read the test entries:\n- \"Shows container status with styling\": \"Given there is a container with status 'started'... the Status column for that row displays 'started' with a styled status badge.\"\n\nBut CSS has `--starting` not `--started`. So status \"started\" would generate class `active-containers__status--started` which doesn't exist in CSS. This is a discrepancy but could be a test spec issue rather than a component issue.\n\nHmm, also the test entry for \"Shows pending container after spawn\" mentions status \"pending\" which also has no CSS class.\n\nI'm noticing a mismatch between the status values the tests expect and the CSS classes available—the tests reference \"started\" and \"pending\" statuses, but the stylesheet only defines styling for \"starting\", \"alive\", and \"finished\", which means those unmapped statuses would render without their intended visual styling. I'm also checking the layout-agnostic directive and CSS variable usage. The components look good on padding—no outer margins on root elements. But I'm noticing hardcoded colors in the WebhookHelpButton CSS instead of using variables, which violates the styling consistency requirement. I need to distinguish between what's actually in the Directives section versus what's in Tips. Looking at the structure of writeApp.md, the CSS variable guidance is listed under Tips, not Directives. The actual Directives are more specific requirements like running npm checks, adding data-testid attributes, using tagged template literals with neon, and handling null conversions for certain data types. I need to verify the structure of the writeApp.md file more carefully. The page padding requirement is actually listed as a Directive around line 109, not under Tips. The component layout-agnostic guideline is the one that appears in the Tips section later. So when checking directives, I should focus on what's explicitly under the Directives header, which includes the consistent padding rule for page components.\n\nNow I'm examining the StatusPage.css file to confirm it implements the padding correctly—it's using 24px for the base padding and 12px on smaller screens, which aligns with Tailwind's p-6 and p-3 utilities at the sm breakpoint. That checks out. I should also verify that the ActiveContainers component satisfies the test requirements specified in the documentation.\n\nLooking at the test entry for \"Shows container status with styling,\" it expects a \"started\" status to display with a styled badge. The component generates the class `active-containers__status--started`, but I don't see corresponding CSS rules for that state—only styles for `--starting`, `--alive`, and `--finished`. This means the started status won't get the expected styling, which is a gap between what the test spec requires and what the code currently delivers. There's a mismatch between the test spec and the CSS—the test expects a \"started\" status but the styles only define \"--starting\". I should flag this discrepancy rather than investigate the backend. Let me also note that the \"--pending\" status used in another test has no corresponding CSS class. Since my focus is on frontend component directives, I'll document these findings and move forward with the analysis.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test entries against testSpec.md directives. The BackLink tests check out—they verify visibility and specify the exact navigation target to the MainPage. Let me continue through the remaining test cases.\n\nFor DefaultPromptDisplay, all three test entries properly validate the display behavior across different states. Moving to ActiveContainers, the tests comprehensively cover the table structure, column headers, and each data field including container names, status with styling, prompts, and timestamps.\n\nWebhookEventFeed tests confirm the feed displays events with all required information and handles the empty state correctly. WebhookHelpButton tests verify visibility and the open interaction, with the close action still being validated.\n\nLooking at the help panel documentation, I'm seeing that all three endpoint types are covered—app-builder-event, spawn-container, and set-default-prompt—along with accurate curl commands that use the actual site URL. The copy functionality for both curl commands and endpoint URLs is present.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing a gap: the directive requires functional test entries for backend API endpoints, but the current test coverage focuses mainly on UI interactions rather than testing the actual endpoint behavior itself.\n\nNow I'm moving into the StatusPage component checks, verifying the test IDs and responsive padding are properly implemented.\n\nDefaultPromptDisplay has the required test IDs and correctly omits outer padding. ActiveContainers has all the necessary test IDs but is missing CSS variables for the \"started\" and \"pending\" statuses that the test spec expects. WebhookEventFeed is next on the checklist. Looking at the test file for the status page, I see there are only 4 tests implemented when the spec actually calls for 28 test entries. Beyond the ones that are covered—pending container spawning, webhook curl commands, and copy button functionality—there are significant gaps like the back link visibility and navigation, plus the default prompt display tests that haven't been written yet. Now I'm checking the WebhookHelpButton functionality—it should open and close the help panel, display documentation for the three webhook endpoints, and include accurate curl command examples. Looking at the existing tests, I notice the \"ActiveContainers: Shows pending container after spawn\" test is mocking the route instead of actually calling the spawn-container endpoint, which doesn't align with what the spec requires. Endpoint URL copy buttons exist — title matches spec, uses proper test IDs and timeouts, verifies clipboard content with URL validation. I'm finding a major gap: 24 StatusPage test entries lack corresponding Playwright tests, and the \"Shows pending container after spawn\" test mocks the endpoint instead of actually calling it as specified. I need to organize these violations into fix tasks, starting with adding missing endpoint functional tests for app-builder-event and set-default-prompt. App: Missing ActiveContainers CSS status styles** - add CSS for --started and --pending\n3. **writeTests: 24 missing StatusPage Playwright tests** - write the missing tests\n4. **writeTests: \"Shows pending container after spawn\" uses mocking instead of calling endpoint** - rewrite to call actual endpoint\n\nWait, the skill says to group related fixes and use add-task rather than fixing immediately. Let me reorganize these violations by what they're addressing.\n\nViolations:\n1. testSpec: Missing endpoint functional test entries for app-builder-event and set-default-prompt → FixViolation for adding spec entries + corresponding tests\n2. writeApp: Missing ActiveContainers CSS status styles for \"started\" and \"pending\" → FixViolation for CSS\n3. writeTests: 24 missing StatusPage Playwright tests → FixViolation for writing tests\n4. writeTests: \"Shows pending container after spawn\" uses mocking instead of calling endpoint → FixViolation for rewriting test\n\nI should group these more strategically. The missing test entries in the spec file should be one task, the CSS styles another, the missing Playwright tests as a third, and the mock rewrite can fold into the larger test writing effort.\n\nSo I'm creating fix tasks for: adding the missing endpoint test entries, implementing the container status styles, writing all the missing Playwright tests, and updating that one test to use the actual endpoint instead of mocks. The test entry explicitly requires POSTing to the endpoint first, so the current mock violates that requirement. I need to decide whether to fix this test in isolation or group it with other endpoint testing issues. Since the writeTests guideline says tests should match their entry requirements and potentially require app code updates, I should organize this as a separate fix task for endpoint-based tests, then consider whether to add missing test entries for the app-builder-event and set-default-prompt endpoints. the violations into fix tasks that make sense to group together. I should create one task per violation category rather than overwhelming future workers with 24+ individual test entries. Let me think about whether missing tests should even be reported as violations—the writeTests directive is about ensuring tests exist for implemented functionality, not about creating new test infrastructure from scratch. tests are written, not about whether all tests exist. The missing tests might be because the app was built incrementally and not all tests were written yet.\n\nBut the skill says to check writeTests.md directive violations in the tests. And the writeTests guideline says \"For a given test entry, write a playwright test which matches the entry's requirements.\" If tests don't exist at all, that's a different issue from a directive violation.\n\nLet me focus on clear directive violations only:\n\n1. **testSpec.md violation**: Missing endpoint functional test entries for `app-builder-event` and `set-default-prompt` (directive: \"test specification must include entries that verify the endpoints actually function correctly\")\n2. **writeApp.md violation**: Missing CSS status styles for \"started\" and \"pending\" (directive: \"make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code\")\n3. **writeTests.md violation**: 24 spec entries lack corresponding Playwright tests, and the \"Shows pending container after spawn\" test uses mocking instead of hitting the actual endpoint\n\nSo I have three separate issues to address: the missing spec entries, the CSS styles, and the incomplete test implementations. Since the missing tests all stem from the same root cause—incomplete test coverage—I should group those together.
