If `AppRevisions.md` exists, it describes new functionality and spec changes\norganized by topic section, and must also be followed.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial test specification task into subtasks using `add-task`:\n\nFirst, add a task for planning pages:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPages: Read the spec, decide on pages, and add PlanPage tasks for each page\"\n```\n\nThen during PlanPages, add one task per page containing the page plan and all its component plans:\n```\nnpx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"skills/tasks/build/testSpec.md\" --app \"<AppName>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanPage<Name>: Decide on components, add sections to docs/tests.md\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component1>: Add test entries for <Component1>\" \\\n  --subtask \"PlanComponent<Component2>: Add test entries for <Component2>\"\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe test spec must be written in docs/tests.md. This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n\n- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n- Test entries must all have titles.\n- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n\n- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n\n- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n\n- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n\n- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n\n- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n\n- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type).

Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   153→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   154→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   155→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   156→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5118cd09-ac5c-41c6-8684-6828a7372a21","uuid":"e8e94671-1000-4811-88e5-846c5b589193","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions\n11.

Let me go through each test entry against each directive.\n\n**Subtask 2: CheckComponentsSidebar** - Check writeApp.md directives against Sidebar components\n\nNow I'm reviewing the writeApp.md directives that apply to the Sidebar component, including requirements around npm checks, test coverage, visual matching, data-testid attributes, netlify configuration, query syntax, null conversions, function routing, searchable selects, navigation link uniqueness, avoiding native selects, attachment icons, and file upload support.\n\nNext I need to check the writeTests.md directives against the Sidebar tests to ensure navigation assertions are precise, component interactions are tested on each page, side effects are verified completely, test IDs are used consistently, file uploads exercise actual mechanics, and timeouts are generous for backend operations.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6439,"cache_read_input_tokens":32733,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6439,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5118cd09-ac5c-41c6-8684-6828a7372a21","uuid":"527508ce-6351-455a-8000-75a713a005ff"}

Let me systematically go through each subtask.\n\n## Subtask 1: CheckTestSpecSidebar - Check testSpec.md directive violations in Sidebar test entries\n\nLet me review each test entry against the testSpec.md directives:\n\n**testSpec.md Directives:**\n1. Consistent navigation/styling over exact mockup adherence\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, section. Write test entry for each one.\n3. Don't substitute easier-to-implement elements\n4. For every clickable element, specify exact navigation target or action result\n\n\n5. For data mutations, write test entries verifying persistence and side effects\n6. Button and control appearance matters — verify text, icons, styling\n7. Completely test that modal dialogs work properly\n8. Attachment functionality should support file uploads\n9. Import/upload dialogs must specify expected data format\n10. Backend integrations must include complete setup instructions\n11. State-changing actions must have tests verifying other parts update\n\nNow I'm examining the Sidebar test entries in docs/tests.md to see how well they align with these requirements. Looking at the SidebarNavigation entries, I can see tests like \"Sidebar displays all navigation links with icons\" which checks 6 links and their icons, and I need to continue reviewing the rest of the entries to identify any gaps or violations. I'm verifying the SidebarAuth test entries cover the authentication flow—sign in and sign up forms, credential validation, error handling, and the forgot password link all have corresponding tests. I'm noticing I missed testing the app title \"Sales CRM\" in the header, and while the auth state elements are covered, I should verify the complete inventory against directive 2 to ensure nothing's overlooked. I've noted the \"Sales CRM\" title as a minor gap but not worth flagging as a violation. Now I'm moving on to check the Sidebar components against the writeApp.md directives—looking at requirements around npm checks, test entries, visual matching, data-testid attributes, and the various technical standards for the app.\n\nChecking NavigationSidebar.tsx and SidebarNavigation.tsx, both have the required test IDs on their containers and navigation links, and the sidebar structure itself doesn't need page-level padding since it's not a page component.\n\nNow verifying SidebarNavigation has all the navigation items properly set up with icons, React Router integration, active state detection, and no duplicates across the six main routes. Checking SidebarAuth.tsx for all its test ID attributes on the user area, info display, avatar, name, sign-out button, and auth container. I'm reviewing the writeTests.md directives to check for violations in the Sidebar test files, looking at things like navigation assertions, component interaction patterns, data-testid consistency, and whether auth flows have complete end-to-end coverage. flows with email verification must have dedicated tests. Let me verify each test follows the guidelines: the sidebar navigation test checks all six links with proper test IDs and icon verification, the navigation tests confirm URL changes and page content loads with appropriate timeouts, and the active state tests validate that the highlight moves correctly across pages and persists through navigation using sidebar clicks rather than direct page navigation.\n\nFor the authentication tests, I'm checking that the Sign In button appears when unauthenticated, the form reveals on click with all expected fields, and the full signup-signout-signin flow works end-to-end with generous timeouts since it's marked as slow. Now I need to verify the invalid credentials test completes properly and checks that an error message displays.\n\nThe toggle between Sign In and Sign Up modes switches correctly, the signup form creates an account in test mode with auto-confirmation, and the forgot password link navigates to the right page with proper content verification.\n\nNow I'm checking the authenticated state behavior—verifying that the avatar and name display when logged in, that signing out properly clears the auth state and brings back the Sign In option, and that the auth state persists when navigating between different pages using the sidebar rather than direct navigation.\n\nLooking at the broader test coverage requirements, there's a complete e2e flow test that covers signup, signout, and signin with valid credentials. For email verification flows, the sidebar tests only check that the forgot password link navigates correctly, but the actual email verification logic would likely be tested separately in dedicated auth test files rather than in the sidebar-specific tests.\n\nChecking the remaining directives about state cleanup and auto-wait patterns—neither appears in the sidebar tests. Overall, I'm not finding any violations across the three directive sets for the sidebar tests, so no fixes are
