Systematically check each file for violations\n\nLet me first figure out which app this is for. \n\nI need to locate the MaterialDetailPage in the codebase to understand which app I'm working with.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2761,"cache_read_input_tokens":23748,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2761,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c3e1974f-130a-42bc-9add-344173670b08","uuid":"4af46baa-7d4f-421f-86e3-2a9496ff0dc0"}

There must be\n    44→  exactly one place where the schema is defined.\n    45→\n    46→The app should also have migration logic for `ALTER TABLE` changes (new columns, new indices)\n    47→that `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` cannot detect.

The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n    54→  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n    55→\n    56→- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n    57→\n    58→- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n    62→  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    63→\n    64→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    65→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    66→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    67→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    68→  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n    69→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n    70→\n    71→- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n    72→  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n    73→  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n    74→\n    75→- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n    76→  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n    77→  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n    78→\n    79→- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n    80→  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n    81→  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n    82→\n    83→- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n    84→  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n    85→\n    86→- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n    87→  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n    88→  to the same destination.\n    89→\n    90→- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n    91→  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n   103→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n   104→\n   105→## Tips\n   106→\n   107→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   108→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   109→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   153→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   154→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   155→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   156→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c3e1974f-130a-42bc-9add-344173670b08","uuid":"c1050b8e-cbb7-43af-a6df-f53f042b8e4a","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

Migrations run after `initSchema` in all\ncontexts (testing, deployment).\n\n## Directives\n\n- Always run `npm run check` from the **app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`),\n  not standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. The app directory has the correct `tsconfig.json`\n  and ESLint config. See `skills/scripts/check.md`.\n\n- When working on a component, identify the test entries in the spec relevant to that component, and make sure that the entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n\n- Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts (horizontal vs vertical), and field sets. Do not simplify the visual design.\n\n- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n  and anything that E2E tests will need to target. Add testids during initial component development,\n  not retroactively. Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n\n- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n  explicitly. When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

Read the component\n    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n\n- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n\n- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Let me now systematically check this against the testSpec.md directives. Let me also read the app spec to understand what the app should look like.\n\nLet me list out the testSpec.md directives I need to check against:\n\n1. Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n\n2. Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n\n\n3. I need to avoid substituting simpler elements for what's actually shown in the mockup. If the design calls for complex columns with joins or computed values, I should test all of them, not just the easiest ones. Same goes for filter controls — if there are four, I test all four.\n4. Every clickable element needs a specific navigation target or action result in the test. I can't leave destinations ambiguous, and for external flows like OAuth or payments, I need to specify how they open and what happens when complete.\n5. For any action that changes data, I need to write test entries that verify the mutation happens correctly.\n\n6. Button appearance matters too — if the mockup specifies certain text, icons, or styling, the test should verify that exact appearance, not just that a button exists.\n7. Modal dialogs need thorough testing to ensure they work properly.\n8. File uploads should be supported unless the mockup indicates otherwise.\n9. Import and upload dialogs need to specify the expected data format upfront, and tests should verify that format documentation is visible to users before they try importing.\n10. Any backend integrations the user can configure — webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps — need complete setup instructions visible in the UI.\n11. State-changing actions require tests to confirm they work as expected.\n\nNow I need to verify that when these actions happen, other parts of the app respond correctly — like ensuring timeline entries are created for tracked mutations, or that reciprocal relationships automatically update both sides when one side changes. Let me go through the MaterialDetailPage test entries and check the mockups in AppSpec.md.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":9867,"cache_read_input_tokens":39791,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":9867,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c3e1974f-130a-42bc-9add-344173670b08","uuid":"429feeb4-15c3-4cdf-809c-855fbb492b19"}

[2026-02-26T20:39:28.131Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01MnUGviHBPVvqX2atE5uMBL","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I can see the mockup. Let me systematically check each testSpec.md directive against the MaterialDetailPage test entries.\n\nLet me review the mockup elements:\n\n**Header area:**\n- Breadcrumb: \"Home > Materials > Carbon Fiber Sheets\"\n- Title: \"Carbon Fiber Sheets\"\n- Subtitle: \"Category: Composite | Unit of Measure: sq meters\"\n- Description text: \"High-strength, lightweight composite sheets used for structural applications and panels. Standard grade.\"\n- Buttons: \"Edit Material\", \"New Batch\", \"New Transaction\"\n\n**Accounts Distribution section:**\n- Heading: \"Accounts Distribution\"\n\n\n- Table with Account Name, Account Type, Quantity, Number of Batches, and Link columns, where \"Warehouse A - Main Storage\" is expandable to show its nested batches with Batch ID, Quantity, Unit, and Created Date, while \"Production Line B\" remains collapsed with a \"View Account\" link\n- **All Batches section** displays a list with filters for Account and Date, showing Batch ID, Location, Quantity, and Created columns with \"View Lineage\" actions\n- **Transactions History section** has Type and Date filters (defaulting to Last 30 Days), displaying Date, Transaction ID, Accounts Involved, Batch References, and Quantity Moved with arrow notation showing source → destination accounts\n\nNow I'm checking the test specifications against the mockup to verify all visible elements are covered, starting with navigation and breadcrumb components. I'm continuing through the test coverage, verifying the View Account link, row expansion and collapse functionality, nested batch data display, batch ID navigation, single batch account expansion, and the empty state handling. Then moving into the All Batches section to confirm the heading and table columns are properly tested.\n\nNow I'm checking the remaining All Batches table functionality including data display, the View Lineage link, batch ID click behavior, and the account filter dropdown with its options and filtering logic, plus the ability to reset that filter and access the date filter dropdown with its available options.\n\nContinuing through the Transactions History section, I'm verifying the section heading, table columns and data display, the arrow notation between transaction and batch references, and the clickability of both Transaction IDs and Batch References, along with the Type filter dropdown.\n\nNow I'm checking the Type filter options and functionality, including the reset capability, then moving into the Date filter for the transactions specifically—testing its dropdown, available options, and filtering behavior both individually and in combination with other filters, plus confirming empty states and reverse chronological ordering.\n\nI'm also verifying that updates to the transaction list propagate correctly when new transactions are added from other components. Looking back at the mockup details, I notice there's a Search bar in the navigation that I haven't found tests for yet—that might be handled as a global component elsewhere. For the Accounts Distribution table, the column headers match what's being tested, including the \"Quantity (sq m)\" unit notation. The All Batches section columns also align with the test coverage I'm seeing.\n\nNow checking the Transactions History table against the mockup—the columns for Date, Transaction ID, Accounts Involved, Batch References, and Quantity Moved all correspond to what's documented in the tests. The test entries appear to faithfully represent the mockup without substituting simpler alternatives. The nested expansion tables and all their fields match as well. I'm also verifying that clickable elements have their exact navigation targets specified, starting with the Home breadcrumb pointing to the Dashboard. I'm verifying the remaining navigation routes are properly wired up—the batch ID links in the All Batches table, transaction IDs, and batch references all route to their respective detail pages. Then I'm checking that data mutations trigger the right side effects, like how editing a material updates the header, creating a batch refreshes both the batches and accounts tables, and new transactions cascade updates across the history, distribution, and batch views.\n\nNow I'm confirming the button styling matches the mockup—the Edit Material button uses a secondary outlined style, while both the New Batch and New Transaction buttons are filled blue primary actions. I'm also noticing the mockup includes \"View Lineage\" links with a chain icon that I need to verify are implemented.\n\nThe modal dialogs for editing materials and creating batches appear fully tested across all key scenarios: opening, pre-filling data, submission, cancellation, and validation rules for each required field. I don't see attachment functionality, import/upload dialogs, or backend integrations needed for this particular page.\n\nNow I'm checking the state management — when I edit a material, the header updates correctly, and creating a batch properly refreshes both the batches table and accounts distribution. New transactions also cascade updates across the transaction history, accounts distribution, and batches table as expected.\n\nLooking back at the mockup more carefully, I notice the \"View Account\" links should have a link icon (🔗) just like the \"View Lineage\" links do, but the test coverage only mentions the text without specifying the icon. That's a potential gap in directive 6 around button and control appearance. Let me verify the URL structure and breadcrumb navigation match the test spec, then cross-check what the AppSpec describes against what's actually tested—the filter functionality, transaction pre-fill feature, and View Lineage links all seem to be covered, but I'm noticing something else in the mockup that might need attention. The spec mentions \"link to that material within the account,\" which could mean either navigating to the account or viewing the material in that account context, but the mockup shows \"View Account\" links that match the tests, so that's what's implemented. The expandable rows for showing batches per account are also well-covered in the test entries. Let me verify the Accounts Distribution table columns match what's specified. The test data for the Accounts Distribution section matches the mockup layout, though I'm noticing the \"View Account\" link description in the test doesn't mention the icon that appears in the mockup, while the \"View Lineage\" link does—this could be an inconsistency worth flagging against the design requirements.\n\nNow I'm systematically checking the mockup for all visible elements, starting with the navigation bar components like the hamburger menu, app name with icon, search functionality, and notification bell.\n\nMoving to the page-specific content, I can see the breadcrumb navigation, material title, category and unit information, description, and action buttons for editing and creating new batches or transactions. The Accounts Distribution section includes a table with expandable rows showing nested batch data, plus filtering options for accounts and dates.\n\nThe Transactions History section has its own filters and table displaying all transaction details with arrow notation in the Accounts Involved column. Looking back at the test coverage, the chevron expand/collapse behavior is already verified, and I notice the mockup shows \"Link\" as a column header—I should verify that's being tested properly. Everything appears to be covered except possibly the icon styling for the View Account links. the icon is fairly standard and minimal, so it might not warrant flagging as a violation. But since the View Lineage test explicitly mentions the chain link icon while View Account doesn't, there's an inconsistency worth noting. Let me continue checking the other button styles in the mockup—the Edit Material, New Batch, and New Transaction buttons all have specific styling that I need to verify against what the tests describe.\n\nNow I'm also checking whether the AppSpec's requirement about \"see lineage chains for this material's batches\" is actually covered by the tests, since the View Lineage link does navigate to the BatchDetailPage where that functionality would be visible.\n\nLooking at the other AppSpec requirements, the expandable account rows showing batch details map to the Accounts Distribution section, the All Batches section covers the list of all batches created for this material, and the Transactions History section handles the transaction list with all the required fields like Date, Transaction ID, and Accounts involved. I'm now verifying whether the batch IDs in those nested tables are actually clickable links.\n\nThe mockup shows batch IDs as plain text in both the nested account tables and the All Batches section, but the tests expect them to be clickable links that navigate to the BatchDetailPage. This seems like a reasonable enhancement beyond what the mockup explicitly shows—making batch IDs interactive adds useful functionality without violating the design directives.\n\nNow I'm checking whether the test coverage matches all the interactive elements in the mockup. The expand/collapse behavior for account rows is tested, and the \"View Account\" links are present in both expanded and collapsed states. I don't see pagination in the mockup or tests, which seems consistent.\n\nLet me verify one more thing against the test directives—specifically that data mutations are properly tested with their side effects. For editing a material, the test confirms persistence to the database, and since materials don't trigger transaction history, that's sufficient. For creating a batch, I need to check if the new batch appears in the All Batches table and whether any other side effects are covered.\n\nLooking at the spec, batches can be created independently or through transactions, so the test doesn't need to verify a transaction being created when using the New Batch button. The Accounts Distribution table update is also tested, which covers the expected side effects.\n\nNow I'm going through each component to verify test coverage—MaterialHeader has 5 tests, EditMaterialButton has 7, NewBatchButton has 6, NewTransactionButton has 2, AccountsDistributionTable has 9, and AllBatchesTable has 14 tests accounted for.\n\nTransactionsHistoryTable rounds out the section with 15 tests, bringing the total to 58 which covers the main functionality pretty well. The NewTransactionButton tests specifically validate the pre-filled material behavior that the AppSpec requires. But I'm noticing a gap—there's a test showing navigation to MaterialDetailPage with an account_id query parameter, yet I don't see corresponding tests in the MaterialDetailPage section that actually handle what should happen when that parameter is present. the account_id query parameter correctly pre-filters the account dropdown.\n\nThis feels like a gap in the test spec — when MaterialDetailPage receives an account_id query param from the AccountDetailPage navigation, there should be a test entry confirming the \"Filter by Account\" dropdown is pre-set to that account. It's not quite a violation of the existing directives, but more of a missing test case that should be added to ensure the page properly handles incoming parameters.\n\nLet me scan through the mockup one more time to make sure I haven't overlooked anything. I'm going through each visible element: the global nav components like the logo and search bar are tested elsewhere, the breadcrumb and title are covered, the metadata fields and description are accounted for, and the Edit Material button is documented. Let me continue checking the rest of the page elements.\n\nLooking at the action buttons and main content sections, I see the New Batch and New Transaction buttons are both marked as tested, along with the Accounts Distribution heading and its expandable table. The All Batches section with its filter controls and table are covered, as is the Transactions History section with its own filters and table. So it seems like everything's accounted for.\n\nThere's one small inconsistency I'm noticing though—the \"View Account\" link in the AccountsDistributionTable doesn't explicitly mention its icon in the test description, whereas the \"View Lineage\" link does reference a chain link icon. But this is pretty minor since both links clearly have icons in the mockup.\n\nLet me dig deeper into the modal tests, particularly the EditMaterialButton modal, to make sure I'm covering directive 7 properly. The modal tests show the button displays correctly, clicking opens it with pre-filled fields like Name, Category, Unit of Measure, and Description, plus Save and Cancel buttons. The submit updates the header, cancel discards changes, and the required field validations are all there for Name, Category, and Unit of Measure. I need to check whether Description validation is being tested.\n\nLooking at the spec, Description appears to be optional since not all materials necessarily have one, so the absence of a \"Description is required\" test makes sense. There's no directive requiring me to test that optional fields allow empty values, so this gap isn't actually a problem.\n\nNow I'm moving on to check the NewBatchButton modal tests.\n\nThe modal tests cover the core functionality—button display, opening with pre-filled material, submission, required field validation, and cancellation—but I notice the optional fields like Location, Lot Number, and Expiration Date mentioned in the test comments are never actually tested for functionality or persistence. This could be a gap under directive 7's requirement to completely test modal dialogs, since the modal contains these fields but there's no verification they work properly. The user clicks the \"Create\" button, but this test entry doesn't exercise any of the optional properties like Location, Lot Number, or Expiration Date. Looking at the All Batches table structure, Location is actually a column that should display batch data, yet the test seems to conflate the account selection with the location property itself, which suggests there might be a gap in test coverage for these optional fields. Looking at the mockup more carefully, those \"Location\" values are definitely account names, not batch-level locations. So the table column is pulling from the account, not from batch properties.\n\nNow I'm noticing that the create batch form mentions optional fields like Location, Lot Number, and Expiration Date, but there's no test coverage for actually using them. That seems to conflict with the directives about testing every element and thoroughly validating modals. Let me check what directive 5 actually requires here.\n\nDirective 5 says any user action that mutates data needs test verification that the change persists. If someone fills in those optional fields, that's a mutation that should be tested. Even though they're optional, directive 2 requires testing every element and directive 7 requires complete modal testing, so optional fields still need coverage.\n\nI'm identifying one clear violation: the create batch modal's optional properties aren't tested for persistence when filled in. That breaks both the element coverage requirement and the modal testing requirement.\n\nFor the View Account link, I'm looking more carefully at the mockup. Both View Account and View Lineage show link icons, but the test entry for View Account doesn't mention the icon while View Lineage's does. That's inconsistent with directive 6 on control appearance, though I should verify this is actually a violation before flagging it. I'm noticing the View Account test doesn't mention the icon that appears in the mockup, while the View Lineage test explicitly references the chain link icon—that's inconsistent. Now I'm wondering whether there should be a test for deleting materials, but the AppSpec doesn't mention it, the mockup doesn't show a delete button, and there's no delete action in the test entries, so that's not needed. The writeApp.md directive about DELETE operations is something I'll check separately. Looking at the MaterialDetailPage description, it only lists Edit Material, New Batch, and New Transaction buttons—no delete functionality specified. I'm also examining another test around line 1277 about the New Transaction button navigating to a pre-filled page. I'm finding a couple of issues with the test coverage. The Create Batch modal has optional fields like Location, Lot Number, and Expiration Date that aren't being tested for persistence and display, which means I'm missing coverage on both the modal functionality and the visible form elements. I also notice the \"View Account\" link test doesn't mention its icon even though the mockup shows one, while the similar \"View Lineage\" link does specify the icon—this inconsistency suggests I need to align the documentation.\n\nNow I'm checking the filter controls across both sections. The All Batches area has Account and Date filters, and the Transactions History has Type and Date filters—all four appear to have test entries covered. I'm also verifying whether the chevron expand/collapse icon in the Accounts Distribution table is properly documented.\n\nLooking at the mockup, I can see the chevron indicators (^ for expanded, > or v for collapsed) next to items like \"Warehouse A - Main Storage,\" and the tests do capture this behavior. So my analysis for subtask 1 is essentially complete.\n\nNow I need to decide whether these violations warrant flagging. The first one—optional properties in the modal form not being tested—represents a real gap since those fields are never exercised. The second one about the View Account icon is more minor and somewhat pedantic, though the directive is explicit about icons mattering, and the inconsistency with View Lineage does make it a clear case. Both are relatively small fixes, so I should flag them but acknowledge they're lower priority issues.\n\nThe skill requires me to add fix tasks for any violations I find rather than fixing them immediately. Since these are two distinct issues, they should be separate tasks. Let me reconsider violation 1 more carefully—the optional properties (Location, Lot Number, Expiration Date) are mentioned in the test structure, but there's no test entry that actually fills these fields, submits the form, and verifies the data persists. That's a clear testing gap that needs addressing. The second violation about the link icon description is a separate concern.\n\nNow I'm reconsidering whether the \"Location\" column in the All Batches table actually comes from a batch-level property or if it's just pulling the account name. Looking at the mockup, the locations match the account names exactly, which suggests the column might be derived from the account rather than stored as a batch property.\n\nEven if the batch-level location property isn't visible in the All Batches table, the test should still verify that optional properties persist when filled in, since they'd show up in the BatchDetailPage. I'll flag both violations as testSpec issues and move forward.\n\nI also need to check the state-changing directive—when a batch is created, the test confirms that AllBatchesTable and

Let me go through each directive:\n\n**Directive 1**: Always run `npm run check` from the app directory\n- This is about running check, not about the code itself. N/A for code review.\n\n**Directive 2**: When working on a component, identify test entries relevant to that component, and make sure entry requirements are satisfied by the app code.\n- I need to check this for each component.\n\n**Directive 3**: Match the visual appearance of elements to the mockup: button variants, icon presence, badge/tag styling, section layouts, field sets.\n\n\n- Need to verify visuals align with the mockup.\n\n**Directive 4**: All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items, and anything that E2E tests will need to target.\n- Need to check all interactive elements have data-testid.\n\n**Directive 5**: In monorepo with app in subdirectory, add `base = \"apps/...\"` to netlify.toml.\n- Not relevant to component code.\n\n**Directive 6**: When using the neon serverless driver, ONLY use tagged template literal syntax.\n- Need to check backend functions.\n\n**Directive 7**: For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP...\n\nConverting empty strings to null before database operations using the `value || null` pattern.\n- Need to check backend functions.\n\n**Directive 8**: Netlify Functions URL path parsing - function name at index 2, resource ID at index 3.\n- Need to check backend functions.\n\n**Directive 9**: When building modals that reference other entities, use a searchable select/dropdown component.\n- The Edit Material modal uses FilterSelect for Category (line 286-295). The Create Batch modal uses FilterSelect for Account (line 409-418). ✅\n\n**Directive 10**: Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links.\n- Not relevant for these components.\n\n**Directive 11**: Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls when the app has a custom design system.\n- The filter controls use FilterSelect (custom component). ✅\n\nScanning through the tables to confirm no native select elements are being used - all filter controls are properly using the FilterSelect component. ✅\n\n**Directive 12**: Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons.\n- No attachments in MaterialDetailPage. N/A.\n\n**Directive 13**: Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads.\n- No attachments in MaterialDetailPage. N/A.\n\n**Directive 14**: Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`).\n- MaterialDetailPage.tsx has the correct padding classes applied to its root element. ✅\n\nNow I need to trace through the backend functions that MaterialDetailPage depends on - it's calling the material-distribution and batches endpoints, plus several Redux slices for fetching materials, batches, transactions, accounts, and categories. Let me verify these functions comply with the writeApp.md directives around tagged template literals, null handling, and URL parsing.\n\nActually, I realize the task is specifically about checking directive violations in the MaterialDetailPage components themselves, not the backend. Let me refocus on the component-level checks - I need to verify data-testid attributes are present on all interactive elements like the root container, modals, buttons, and form inputs. Adding test IDs for the batch creation modal elements...\n\nNow I'm moving on to the MaterialHeader component, setting up test identifiers for the header section, material details, and action buttons like editing and creating new batches.\n\nContinuing with the AccountsDistributionTable, I'm adding test IDs for the table structure, individual account rows, and their expandable sections with account-specific identifiers. Adding test IDs for the AllBatchesTable component, including the section wrapper, filter controls, empty state, table itself, and individual batch rows with their associated links and location fields. I'm finishing up the test IDs for transaction rows and their properties, but I notice the batch reference links in the transactions table are missing their test identifiers.\n\nLooking at the batch link code, it navigates to a batch detail page when clicked, but there's no data-testid attribute on it. This is a problem because the test suite expects to be able to click on batch references like \"B-2023-010\", so I need to add a test ID there to match the test requirements.\n\nI'm also checking the visual appearance against the mockup to see if the styling matches, particularly looking at things like the \"View Account\" link and whether it displays the right icon. Looking at the layout structure across all the table components, they're all properly avoiding outer padding by using the page-header class. But I'm finding a major violation in MaterialDetailPage—the Edit Material and Create Batch modals are embedded directly in the page file with over 280 lines of JSX instead of being extracted into separate component files, which breaks the abstraction requirement.\n\nLet me reconsider though—I need to distinguish between Guidelines and Directives. The skill specifically asks me to check against directives, not guidelines, so this modal issue might not be what I should be flagging. I should focus on what's actually listed in the Directives section rather than the Guidelines section.\n\nLooking at the directives for this component, I need to check things like whether it uses searchable selects for entity references, avoids native HTML selects for filters, includes proper data-testid attributes, and follows the other frontend-specific requirements listed.\n\nI'm finding two violations so far: the batch reference links in TransactionsHistoryTable are missing data-testid attributes that tests would need to target them, and the \"View Account\" links in AccountsDistributionTable are missing the link icon that appears in the mockup.\n\nNow I'm checking directive 2 more carefully by cross-referencing test requirements against the actual component code. The Material header correctly displays category and unit of measure, and I'm verifying the breadcrumb structure matches the expected Home > Materials > Material Name format.\n\nI'm also confirming that all the navigation links work as expected—View Account navigates to the account detail page, Transaction IDs link to transaction details, and Batch References link to batch details. Each of these navigation paths is correctly implemented with the proper route parameters.\n\nNow I'm noticing a potential inconsistency: the NewTransactionButton component navigates to `/transactions/new` without query parameters, while MaterialHeader has its own button that includes the material ID as a query parameter when navigating to the same route.\n\nI'm also spotting a React warning issue in AccountsDistributionTable where the Fragment wrapper around mapped rows doesn't have a key attribute, even though the `<tr>` elements inside do. The section containers already have testids, so tests can locate the headings within them using text matching without needing additional testids on the heading elements themselves. I'm satisfied with the analysis and ready to move forward with documenting the
