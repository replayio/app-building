Reference docs/tests.md to identify which elements need testids.\n    58→\n    59→- In a monorepo where the app is in a subdirectory (e.g., `apps/SalesCRM`), add `base = \"apps/SalesCRM\"`\n    60→  to `netlify.toml` so that Netlify CLI resolves the functions directory relative to the app root,\n    61→  not the git repository root. IMPORTANT: even with `base` set, `netlify dev` may still resolve the\n    62→  functions directory incorrectly. The Playwright config's `webServer` must pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n    63→  explicitly.

Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    88→\n    89→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    90→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    91→  icon for all attachment types.\n    92→\n    93→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    94→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n    95→\n    96→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n    97→  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n    98→  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n    99→\n   100→## Tips\n   101→\n   102→- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n   103→  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n   104→  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n   105→  ```ts\n   106→  build: {\n   107→    sourcemap: true,\n   108→    minify: false,\n   109→  },\n   110→  define: {\n   111→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   112→  },\n   113→  ```\n   114→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   115→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   116→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   117→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   118→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   119→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   120→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   121→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   122→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   123→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   124→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   125→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   126→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   127→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   128→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   129→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   130→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   131→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   132→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   133→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   134→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   135→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   136→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   137→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   138→\n   139→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   140→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   141→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   142→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   143→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   144→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1de25650-0916-49a5-a5f2-6a397262e694","uuid":"e84e50ef-1a84-4007-90d5-14c0d691b54a","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Strategy\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide in AppStyle.md.

id, name, title, email, phone, location, created_at, updated_at\n- **client_individuals** - join table linking clients and individuals (id, role, is_primary)\n- **relationships** - individual_id, related_individual_id, relationship_type, created_at\n- **contact_history** - individual_id, interaction_type, summary, team_member, contact_date, created_at\n- **clients** - id, name, type, status, industry (for associated clients display)\n\n---\n\n### **Redux Slices & Pattern**\n\n#### **Architecture**\n- Redux Toolkit with `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`\n- Three main slices: clients, tasks, deals\n- Typed hooks: `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`\n- Store configuration in `/src/store/index.ts`\n\n#### **Typical Slice Pattern**\n```typescript\nexport const fetchData = createAsyncThunk('slice/fetch', async (...) => { \n  // API call to /.netlify/functions/...\n})\n\nconst slice = createSlice({\n  name: 'slice',\n  initialState,\n  reducers: { /* synchronous actions */ },\n  extraReducers: (builder) => { /* handle async actions */ }\n})\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Netlify Functions Pattern**\n\n#### **Handler Structure**\n- Entry point: `/netlify/functions/[resource].ts`\n- Uses Neon serverless SQL client\n- Handles: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with CORS headers\n- Path-based routing: `event.path.split('/').filter(Boolean)`\n- Returns JSON: `json(statusCode, body)`\n\n#### **Individuals Functions**\n- `GET /individuals/:id` - Get individual with associated clients\n- `GET /individuals/:id/relationships` - List relationships\n- `POST /individuals/:id/relationships` - Create relationship (creates reciprocal)\n- `GET /individuals/:id/contact-history` - List contact history\n- `POST /individuals/:id/contact-history` - Create entry\n- `PUT /individuals/:id/contact-history/:entryId` - Update entry\n- `GET /individuals/:id/clients` - Get associated clients\n\n---\n\n### **Component Patterns**\n\n#### **State Management**\n- `useState` for local UI state (loading, filters, modals)\n- `useCallback` for fetch functions with dependencies\n- `useEffect` for initial data loading\n- Direct fetch to `/.netlify/functions/...` endpoints\n\n#### **Navigation**\n- `useNavigate()` from react-router-dom\n- Navigate patterns: `navigate('/clients/:clientId')`, `navigate('/individuals/:individualId')`\n\n#### **Example Component Pattern**\n```typescript\nconst [data, setData] = useState([])\nconst [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)\nconst fetchData = useCallback(async () => {\n  try {\n    const res = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/endpoint/${id}`)\n    const data = await res.json()\n    setData(data.items || [])\n  } finally {\n    setLoading(false)\n  }\n}, [id])\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchData()\n}, [fetchData])\n```\n\n---\n\n### **CSS Variable System & Styling**\n\n#### **Color Palette (from index.css)**\n```\nBackgrounds:\n- --color-bg-sidebar: #f5f5f5\n- --color-bg-base: #fcfcfc\n- --color-bg-hover: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.063)\n- --color-bg-active: #efefef\n- --color-bg-selected: #ededed\n\nBorders:\n- --color-border-default: #dcdcdc\n- --color-border-light: #e0e0e0\n\nText:\n- --color-text-primary: #1a1a1a\n- --color-text-secondary: #2d2e2f\n- --color-text-muted: #59595a\n- --color-text-disabled: #b0b5c0\n\nAccent:\n- --color-accent: #7180ff (primary blue)\n- --color-accent-blue: #5d85ff\n- --color-accent-purple: #9577ff\n- --color-accent-muted: #6d78d5\n```\n\n#### **Status & Priority Badges**\n```\nStatus (with backgrounds):\n- Active: #22c55e / bg #f0fdf4 (green)\n- Inactive: #6b7280 / bg #f3f4f6 (gray)\n- Prospect: #f59e0b / bg #fffbeb (yellow)\n- Churned: #ef4444 / bg #fef2f2 (red)\n\nPriority:\n- High: #ef4444 / bg #fef2f2 (red)\n- Medium: #f59e0b / bg #fffbeb (orange)\n- Low: #22c55e / bg #f0fdf4 (green)\n- Normal: #6b7280 / bg #f3f4f6 (gray)\n```\n\n#### **Spacing & Sizing**\n```\nBorder Radius:\n- --radius-sm: 4px (buttons, inputs)\n- --radius-md: 6px (cards, containers)\n- --radius-lg: 8px (modals)\n\nShadows:\n- --shadow-sm: rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0px 4px 12px\n- --shadow-md: ^ + rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0px 0px 0px 1px (elevated)\n\nButton Heights: 28px (standard)\nSidebar Width: 244px\n```\n\n#### **Typography**\n```\nFont: Inter (variable weight)\nSizes:\n- 24px (person name / large headings)\n- 20px (page titles)\n- 16px (section headings)\n- 14px (labels, subtitle text)\n- 13px (body, standard)\n- 12px (small labels/metadata)\n- 11px (tiny/badges)\n\nWeights:\n- 700 (name, bold)\n- 600 (headings)\n- 500 (semibold labels)\n- 400 (body)\n```\n\n#### **Person Detail Specific Classes**\n```\n.person-header -

Let me verify each one against the test specs:\n\n1. **PersonHeader** - ✅ Complete. Has name, title, client associations with pipe separator, email/phone/location with icons, associated clients as clickable underlined links.\n\n2. **RelationshipsSection** - ✅ Complete. Has heading with icon, Graph/List view tabs, filter button with By Type and By Client sections, Add Entry button with modal, delete with confirmation, empty state, relationship entries with name, type, title, client, [Link].\n\n3. **ContactHistorySection** - ✅ Complete. Has heading with clock icon, chronological entries with date/time, interaction type, summary, team member, edit icon, filter button with By Interaction Type and By Date Range, Add Entry button with modal, empty state.\n\n\n4. **AssociatedClientsSection** - ✅ Complete. Has heading with icon, client cards with icon, name, status, industry, View Client Detail Page button, empty state.\n\n5. **PersonDetailPage** - ✅ Complete. Has loading state, not found state, renders PersonHeader with all props, RelationshipsSection, ContactHistorySection, AssociatedClientsSection with individualId.\n\nThe backend endpoints are all implemented, CSS styles are complete with all person-detail-related styling, and all components have proper data-testid attributes for testing. Continuing through the test IDs for the relationships and contact history sections... I've verified all the test IDs are in place across the contact history and associated clients sections, including the delete confirmation buttons. Let me check if there's an AppRevisions file that might have additional requirements I need to account for.\n\nLooking back at the implementation against the spec, the delete relationship flow is complete—there's a trash icon that triggers a modal with the exact confirmation text, and both cancel and delete buttons are properly wired up. Everything appears to be fully implemented without placeholders or mock data, so I should run a type check to ensure it all compiles correctly. I'm noticing the `--spacing-lg` variable used in the modal's padding doesn't have a fallback value, which could cause layout issues if the variable isn't defined elsewhere in the CSS. The `--color-danger` variable has a fallback of `#dc2626`, so that should render fine, but I need to check what spacing values are actually available in the style guide. I see there's a `btn-danger` class already defined, so I should use that instead of the inline style override. Let me also verify the layout directives—the `person-section` has margin and padding, but that's acceptable since these are self-contained section components rather than reusable layout primitives.\n\nNow I'm checking whether all the CSS classes referenced in the components actually exist in the stylesheet. The `relationship-delete` class is being used on the delete button, but I don't see it defined in the CSS file. The button would render with just default styling, which might work for the test since it only needs to be clickable, but it probably needs proper styling to look right.\n\nI'm also noticing a few other potential issues: the delete modal references a `--spacing-lg` variable that doesn't seem to exist, and the delete button is using an inline style instead of the `btn-danger` class. Let me identify all the styling gaps that need to be fixed.\n\nLooking at similar delete patterns in the codebase like `linked-task-remove` and `deal-contact-remove`, the `relationship-delete` button should have consistent hover styles to match those conventions.\n\nI need to add the CSS class for `relationship-delete`, fix the spacing variable in the delete modal, and use the `btn-danger` class for the delete button instead of inline styles. But actually, the components are already functional and written—these are just minor styling refinements. The strategy does emphasize matching the visual design to the mockup though, so I should make sure the button variants and styling are correct before considering this complete. I'm reconsidering whether those styling issues actually need fixing—the tests don't require perfect CSS, just functional components. Let me run the type check to verify everything compiles and the quality gates

The button itself will still render since browsers handle unstyled buttons with SVG children, but I should add proper CSS for the trash icon to ensure consistent sizing and positioning.\n\nI also see the delete modal's inline padding uses that undefined spacing variable, so the message text won't have proper side padding. Let me fix both the CSS class and the modal's inline styles to match the mockup's visual appearance. at whether the `relationship-delete` styling absence might cause a visual problem.\n\nLooking at other delete/trash buttons in the codebase:\n- `linked-task-remove` (line 2196) - has `flex-shrink: 0` and `color: var(--color-text-muted)` with hover color change\n- `deal-contact-remove` (line 2342) - same pattern\n\nThe `relationship-delete` button should follow this pattern. Let me add it to the CSS.\n\nI also notice the delete confirmation modal uses inline padding styles when the `modal-text` class already handles that. I'll apply those two fixes: adding the missing `relationship-delete` CSS class and switching the modal to use the existing `modal-text` class instead.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":321,"cache_read_input_tokens":92683,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":321,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"1de25650-0916-49a5-a5f2-6a397262e694","uuid":"cb948ac7-f6ee-4898-8646-49f6d829bd37"}
