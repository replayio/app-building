The subtask is \"Unpack: Review fixed bug reports\" which means I need to check if there are unreviewed bug reports. Since the file doesn't exist, there are no unreviewed bug reports to process. \n\nThe skill says: \"If there are any unreviewed bug reports in bugReports.md, add one task per bug using add-task\". Since there is no bugReports.md file, there are no unreviewed bug reports, and there's nothing to unpack.\n\nI should complete this task since there's nothing to do.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":267,"cache_read_input_tokens":27538,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":267,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2cd4843d-8106-4d70-a2ee-ad3da57ce3ff","uuid":"ec40e9bc-3ff1-42e7-b12e-7fcccdde035f"}
