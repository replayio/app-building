Multi-step\n    91→  end-to-end flows easily exceed the default 60s timeout under recording and CI environments.\n    92→\n    93→- Skill files are at `/repo/skills/tasks/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    94→  the app directory.

Read the component\n    98→    source to verify testid values before writing the test — do not guess.\n    99→  - Handle empty-state scenarios gracefully. A freshly deployed app may have no data, so tests\n   100→    must not assume specific records exist. Check for empty-state UI (e.g., \"No items\" messages)\n   101→    or create test data before asserting on table/list contents.\n   102→  - Use generous timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 10000 }`) for element assertions. First-load\n   103→    performance on a cold deploy is slower than local development.\n   104→  - Verify that API endpoints are healthy before running deployment tests. See\n   105→    `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`.\n   106→\n   107→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n   108→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n   109→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n   110→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n   111→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n   112→\n   113→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n   114→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n   115→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n   116→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n   117→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n   118→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n   119→\n   120→- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n   121→  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n   122→  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n   123→  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n   124→  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n   125→  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n   126→  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n   127→  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n   128→\n   129→## Parallel Test Design\n   130→\n   131→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n   132→Write tests with this in mind:\n   133→\n   134→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n   135→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   136→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   137→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   138→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   139→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   140→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   141→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   142→  being unmodified.\n   143→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   144→  you need to interact with.\n   145→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   146→- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n   147→  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n   148→  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n   149→- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n   150→  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n   151→  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n   152→  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n   153→\n   154→## Tips\n   155→\n   156→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   157→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   158→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   159→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   160→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   161→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   162→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   163→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   164→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   165→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7e833dc6-0fa4-4dd5-b96f-1131798ab454","uuid":"135d993e-e05e-49db-9004-b95f54ae9d65","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing playwright tests which check that all the different entries in docs/tests.md are satisfied by the app.\n\n## Unpack Subtasks\n\nUnpack the initial write tests task into subtasks using `add-task`.

Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Key Observations\n\n1. **Test Coverage:** All three main components have comprehensive Playwright tests\n2. **Component Hierarchy:** \n   - NewTransactionModal is the parent component\n   - It composes TransactionHeaderFields, LineItemsTable, BalanceIndicator, and TagsInput\n3. **Data Flow:** \n   - NewTransactionModal manages all state\n   - Child components are controlled components with callbacks\n4. **Validation:** \n   - Transaction must be balanced (debits = credits)\n   - Description must not be empty\n   - At least 2 line items required\n5. **Testing Pattern:** Tests use consistent helper function `openNewTransactionModal` to set up the modal state\n6. **Types:** LineItem exported from LineItemsTable.tsx for use in NewTransactionModal\n7. **Accessibility:** Heavy use of data-testid attributes for reliable test selectors\n8. **Currency Support:** 4 currencies supported (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY)"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: ac121ce344ca73870 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 51182\ntool_uses: 19\nduration_ms: 54133</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7e833dc6-0fa4-4dd5-b96f-1131798ab454","uuid":"76291150-ae9c-4300-ba99-b7c7b57f6b53","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the Accounting app at /repo/apps/Accounting.

Key Observations\n\n1. **Test Coverage:** All three main components have comprehensive Playwright tests\n2. **Component Hierarchy:** \n   - NewTransactionModal is the parent component\n   - It composes TransactionHeaderFields, LineItemsTable, BalanceIndicator, and TagsInput\n3. **Data Flow:** \n   - NewTransactionModal manages all state\n   - Child components are controlled components with callbacks\n4. **Validation:** \n   - Transaction must be balanced (debits = credits)\n   - Description must not be empty\n   - At least 2 line items required\n5. **Testing Pattern:** Tests use consistent helper function `openNewTransactionModal` to set up the modal state\n6. **Types:** LineItem exported from LineItemsTable.tsx for use in NewTransactionModal\n7. **Accessibility:** Heavy use of data-testid attributes for reliable test selectors\n8. **Currency Support:** 4 currencies supported (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY)"}],"totalDurationMs":54133,"totalTokens":51182,"totalToolUseCount":19,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":625,"cache_read_input_tokens":44029,"output_tokens":6525,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":625},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"}}}

Let me review what I need to add:\n\n1. **WriteTestLineItemsAddBtn**: \"LineItemsTable Add Line Item button adds new row\"\n   - Test spec says: User clicks \"+ Add Line Item\" button below existing rows → new empty row appended with empty Account (\"Select Account\"), Type defaulted to \"Debit\", empty Amount, trash icon delete button. Button displays plus icon + \"Add Line Item\" text.\n\n2. **WriteTestLineItemsMultiple**: \"LineItemsTable supports multiple line items for multi-account transactions\"\n   - Test spec says: Start with no line items (but actually the modal opens with 2 empty rows by default). Click \"+ Add Line Item\" three times and fill in: row 1 Credit Checking 1500, row 2 Debit Rent 1350, row 3 Debit Utilities 150. \n\nI need to verify all three rows display correctly with the BalanceIndicator showing Total Debits: $1,500.00 and Total Credits: $1,500.00. There's a discrepancy between the spec saying the modal starts with no line items and the actual implementation that opens with 2 empty rows, so I'll work with what the modal actually does. might be a bit idealized - but the test needs to work with the actual app.\n\nLooking at the code in NewTransactionModal.tsx, it initializes with 2 empty rows by default. The test spec says to click \"+ Add Line Item\" three times, which would result in 5 total rows, but the expected outcome only mentions 3 rows with specific data. There's a mismatch between what the spec describes as \"no line items\" initially and what the code actually provides - I need to figure out if the test should start fresh or work with the existing 2 default rows.\n\nThe account codes are also inconsistent: the spec references 1010, 5010, 5020, but the existing tests show the actual accounts in the system are 1001, 1002, 5001. I should align the test with the real account codes that exist in the database rather than the spec's idealized codes. I need to figure out which accounts are actually available in the database rather than guessing. Let me outline the three test cases I need to write: one for adding a line item that verifies the row count increases, another for multiple line items that checks all the data displays correctly with a balance indicator, and an initial state test that confirms two empty rows appear by default. Once I know what accounts exist in the seed data, I can pick appropriate ones for the test scenarios. Let me verify the balance sheet math - the debits and credits should both total $1,500. I'm also checking the default entry types in the initial row setup, which defaults the first row to debit and the second to credit, so I'll need to flip those when entering Checking Account as a credit and Rent Expense as a debit. So I need to flip the account types for rows 0 and 1 to match the spec, while row 2 is already correct. Now I'm checking what accounts are available in the system to make sure I'm using the right

The available accounts in the DB are:\n- Checking Account (1001) - assets\n- Savings Account (1002) - assets\n- Investment Portfolio (1003) - assets\n- Credit Card (2001) - liabilities\n- Mortgage Loan (2002) - liabilities\n- Car Loan (2003) - liabilities\n- Retained Earnings (3001) - equity\n- Owner's Equity (3002) - equity\n- Service Revenue (4001) - revenue\n- Product Revenue (4002) - revenue\n- Operating Expenses (5001) - expenses\n\n\n- Payroll Expenses (5002) - expenses\n\nI'm noticing a discrepancy though—the existing tests reference \"Rent Expense\" and \"Utilities Expense,\" but these accounts don't exist in the seed data. Let me trace through the test files to see if there's additional setup logic creating these accounts or if the tests are expecting data that isn't actually there.\n\nLooking at the account dropdown test, it shows Checking Account, Savings Account, and Operating Expenses, which matches the seed data. But the delete row test and new-transaction-modal tests both try to select \"Rent Expense\" from the dropdown. Either these tests would fail against the current seed data, or there's another source of account data I'm missing.\n\nFilling the account input field and selecting from the dropdown... I'm realizing the spec was written with hypothetical account codes that don't match the actual seed data, so I need to verify which accounts actually exist in the database before writing my tests. The existing tests reference accounts like \"Rent Expense\" that may or may not be present, and since I'm supposed to complete any unfinished implementation, I should check whether these accounts need to be created or if I should adapt my tests to use accounts that definitely exist. I'm verifying the math works out—debits and credits balance at 1500 each. The spec references account codes that don't exist in the seed data, so I'll stick with the accounts I know are available: Checking Account (1001) and Operating Expenses (5001), which will satisfy the test requirements.\n\nLooking at the existing test file, I can see other tests reference \"Rent Expense\" with a non-null assertion, which suggests it should exist in the database. Either there's a migration that adds these accounts, or the database has been modified since the initial seed. Since previous tests depend on these accounts being present, I should check if there's additional setup creating them.\n\nLet me refocus on what I actually need to test. The first test case is checking that clicking the \"+ Add Line Item\" button creates a new row with default values—an empty account dropdown, debit type, empty amount, and a trash icon.\n\nFor the second test, I'm setting up a multi-account transaction with three line items: Checking Account as a credit for $1,500, Rent Expense as a debit for $1,350, and a third account for the remaining $150 debit to balance it out. I need to pick an appropriate third account that makes sense for this scenario.\n\nLooking at the seed data, \"Utilities Expense\" isn't available, but \"Operating Expenses (5001)\" exists and would work fine for the test. The key thing I'm validating is that multiple rows can be filled with different accounts and amounts, and that the balance indicator correctly totals the debits and credits. I should also verify that \"Rent Expense\" is actually in the database before running the test.\n\nI'll go with accounts from the seed data to keep things reliable: Checking Account (1001) for a credit of 1500, Operating Expenses (5001) for a debit of 1350, and Payroll Expenses (5002) for a debit of 150. This balances perfectly with total debits and credits both at 1500.
