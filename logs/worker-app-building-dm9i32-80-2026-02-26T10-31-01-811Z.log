There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects.

Do not simplify the visual design.\n    59→\n    60→- All components must include `data-testid` attributes on interactive elements, containers, list items,\n    61→  and anything that E2E tests will need to target.

Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n    92→  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n    93→\n    94→- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n    95→  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n    96→  icon for all attachment types.\n    97→\n    98→- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n    99→  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n   100→\n   101→- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n   102→  so content is never flush against the screen edges.

Configure this with:\n   110→  ```ts\n   111→  build: {\n   112→    sourcemap: true,\n   113→    minify: false,\n   114→  },\n   115→  define: {\n   116→    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n   117→  },\n   118→  ```\n   119→  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n   120→  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n   121→- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n   122→  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n   123→- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n   124→  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n   125→- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n   126→  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n   127→- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n   128→  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n   129→  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n   130→- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n   131→  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n   132→  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n   133→- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n   134→  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n   135→- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n   136→  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n   137→- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n   138→  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n   139→  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n   140→- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n   141→  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n   142→  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n   143→\n   144→- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n   145→  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n   146→  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n   147→\n   148→- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n   149→  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n   150→\n   151→- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n   152→  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n   153→  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n   154→  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n   155→  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n   156→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ed697034-7d4f-489a-b949-ae3c47e64c10","uuid":"a1b6e35f-51cd-463a-b3df-3f6e96b07dc9","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md","content":"# Skill\n\nYou are writing the database and code for the app to match the specs in AppSpec.md and docs/tests.md, and to match an optional style guide.

When curling endpoints manually, start the server the same way:\n  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`.\n\n- When using the neon serverless driver (`@neondatabase/serverless`), ONLY use tagged template literal\n  syntax for queries: `` sql`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${id}` ``. NEVER use `sql(queryString, paramsArray)`.\n  For dynamic WHERE clausess, build composable query fragments and conditionally include them in the tagged template.\n\n- For database columns with DATE, TIMESTAMP, or UUID types, always convert empty strings to null\n  before inserting or updating. Use `value || null` instead of `value ?? null`, because the nullish\n  coalescing operator (`??`) does not convert empty strings.\n\n- Netlify Functions accessed at `/.netlify/functions/<name>/<resourceId>` have the function name at\n  path index 2 and the resource ID at index 3 (after splitting on `/` and filtering empty segments).\n  Common off-by-one error: using index 2 for the resource ID when it contains the function name.\n\n- When building modals that reference other entities (e.g., adding a relationship to a person), use a\n  searchable select/dropdown component, not a plain text input for IDs.\n\n- Navigation sidebars and menus must not contain duplicate links pointing to the same URL. Each\n  navigation item must have a unique route. Remove or consolidate any entries that would navigate\n  to the same destination.\n\n- Never use native HTML `<select>` elements for filter controls or dropdowns when the app has a\n  custom design system or style guide. Native form elements cannot be fully styled and will revert\n  to browser defaults on interaction. Always use custom dropdown components with React state.\n\n- Attachment displays should show file-type-specific icons or thumbnails (e.g., image preview for\n  images, document icon for PDFs, spreadsheet icon for CSVs). Do not use a single generic file\n  icon for all attachment types.\n\n- Attachment functionality must support actual file uploads. Any UI that allows adding attachments\n  must include a working file upload mechanism (e.g., file picker, drag-and-drop), not just link entry.\n\n- Every page component must include consistent padding on its root element (`p-6 max-sm:p-3`)\n  so content is never flush against the screen edges. This applies to all pages including\n  centered layouts (auth forms, error pages) — add padding alongside centering utilities.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development build in\n  `vite.config.ts` so that Replay recordings show readable source code with full React component names\n  and developer warnings. Configure this with:\n  ```ts\n  build: {\n    sourcemap: true,\n    minify: false,\n  },\n  define: {\n    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n  },\n  ```\n  The `define` setting forces React to use its development bundle in production builds, which preserves\n  component display names and enables React DevTools support in Replay recordings. Never remove these settings.\n- When scaffolding a new Vite project, the target directory must be empty. Scaffold in a temp directory\n  (`/tmp/<name>`) and copy the needed files to the app directory.\n- Plan the complete data flow before writing code: what the backend endpoint returns, what the Redux\n  slice state shape looks like, and what props each component needs. Write backend → Redux → sections → modals → page.\n- When significantly modifying an existing file (>50% of lines), use Write to replace the entire file\n  rather than multiple sequential Edits. Avoid chains of 4-5 Edits to the same file.\n- When a React component uses `useState` with a prop as the initial value, the state will NOT update\n  when the prop changes. Add a `useEffect` to sync local state with prop changes, or use the prop\n  directly for display and only use local state during editing.\n- For Redux slices, avoid setting `loading = true` during refetches when data already exists. Only show\n  loading indicators on initial load (`state.items.length === 0`). This prevents \"Loading...\" flashes\n  that cause tests to see empty content during refetches.\n- When an async operation (like saving) should visually complete before closing edit mode, make the\n  `onUpdate`/`onSave` callback return a Promise, and await it before calling `setEditing(false)`.\n- If the backend supports DELETE operations for a resource, the UI must include delete buttons/actions.\n  Check all backend endpoints and ensure the frontend exposes every CRUD operation.\n- When adding domain-specific colors (e.g., status badge colors), always define them as CSS variables\n  in `index.css` under the `@theme` block rather than hardcoding `rgba()`/`rgb()` values in component\n  files. This keeps all colors centralized and easy to theme.\n- Components should be layout-agnostic: do NOT include outer padding (`px-*`) or margin in component\n  root elements. Let the parent page/layout control spacing. When components embed their own padding,\n  composing them in flex rows causes double-padding conflicts that require rework.\n\n- Prefer using the Glob and Grep tools over shell `find`, `ls`, and `grep` commands for file\n  exploration and content searching. The dedicated tools provide better structured output and\n  avoid unnecessary shell command overhead.\n\n- When downloading mockup images for visual reference, use `curl -L -o /tmp/<filename> <url>`.\n  This pattern works well for fetching mockups from UploadThing or other image hosts.\n\n- Do not use `overflow: hidden` on containers that have children with absolutely-positioned elements\n  (e.g., dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips). The overflow clipping will cut off content that extends\n  beyond the container boundary. Additionally, elements that render floating/overlapping UI (such as\n  action menu wrappers) must establish their own stacking context with `position: relative` and an\n  explicit `z-index` so they appear above sibling elements.\n","numLines":156,"startLine":1,"totalLines":156}}}

This catches issues like email\n  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n\n- Auth flows that involve email-based verification (email confirmation, password reset) must\n  have dedicated tests that exercise the real production code path — not the IS_TEST bypass.\n  These tests must run the backend without IS_TEST=true (or with IS_TEST=false) so that actual\n  tokens are generated and stored. The test should call the signup/forgot-password endpoint,\n  query the database directly for the generated token, then hit the confirmation/reset endpoint\n  with that token and verify success. This ensures the full flow works end-to-end: token\n  generation, storage, URL construction, and redemption. Other (non-auth-flow) tests may\n  continue to use IS_TEST=true to bypass auth for convenience.\n\n## Parallel Test Design\n\nTests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\nWrite tests with this in mind:\n\n- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n  being unmodified.\n- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n  you need to interact with.\n- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n- The Playwright config must use `replayDevices['Replay Chromium']` from `@replayio/playwright`\n  as the browser project, not standard `devices['Desktop Chrome']`. Tests must run under the\n  Replay browser so that recordings are captured for debugging.\n- Set the Playwright config's global `timeout` and `webServer.timeout` to at least 60000ms.\n  The Replay browser has significant recording overhead, and with parallel workers all hitting\n  the dev server simultaneously, pages can take 25+ seconds to load. A 30s timeout that works\n  locally with standard Chrome will cause widespread flakes under recording.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n","numLines":165,"startLine":1,"totalLines":165}}}

Let me re-read the directives from writeApp.md more carefully. Let me check whether this pattern exists in other components to understand if it's a codebase convention.\n\nActually, let me re-read the testSpec.md directive: \"Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\"\n\nThis is a testSpec.md directive, but it's about the app code (comments in JSX). Let me check if other components follow this convention.\n\n\nI'm realizing this testSpec.md directive is actually instructing me to add comments in the JSX code itself, linking each interactive element to the test titles that cover it — so even though it's in the test specification file, it's a requirement for how I write the app code.\n\nNow let me focus on what writeApp.md actually requires for CheckComponentsUserDetailPage. The key directives are: run `npm run check` before committing, ensure test entry requirements are met, match the visual mockup, add `data-testid` attributes to all interactive elements and containers, and follow specific patterns for database operations and monorepo configuration.\n\nI'm checking directive 4 about `data-testid` attributes across the UserHeader component—the back button, avatar container, and name field all have the required testids, but I need to verify the email field is also properly tagged. I'm continuing to map out the test IDs for the AssignedTasksList component, covering task properties like title, client, due date, priority, and status, then moving into the RecentActivityFeed section.\n\nNow I'm verifying that the test entries in the spec match what's actually implemented in the code. Starting with UserHeader, I need to confirm the user name displays as an h1, the email shows up in a span, and the join date is properly formatted with a \"Joined\" label.\n\nFor UserStats, I'm checking that the active deals, open tasks, and total deals counts are all pulling from the right user properties and rendering correctly. The OwnedDealsList component needs to display the \"Owned Deals\" heading, and each deal should show its name, stage as a badge, and formatted value.\n\nNow I'm verifying the AssignedTasksList section displays task titles, due dates, priorities as badges, statuses, and client names. Each task entry should be clickable to navigate to its detail page, and there's an empty state for when there are no tasks assigned.\n\nFor the RecentActivityFeed, I'm checking that activities render in reverse chronological order with timestamps and descriptions, and there's an empty state when nothing's available.\n\nI'm also confirming the directives are met—no native select elements are used, and navigation sidebars don't have duplicate links.\n\nNow I'm verifying UserDetailPage has the required consistent padding, and I need to clarify which subtask handles the JSX comment directive about test coverage—it seems like it could belong to either the test spec or component checks, but based on the subtask names, the component check should focus on writeApp.md violations. I'm realizing this comment requirement is from testSpec.md, not writeApp.md, so it's technically outside my current scope—but let me check how other components handle it to be thorough before deciding

This is a testSpec.md directive (\"There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it\"), not a writeApp.md directive. Since I'm checking writeApp.md directives for components in this subtask, this is outside my scope.\n\nLet me now also check the backend function for the users endpoint, since it's referenced by these components. Actually, the subtask says \"Check writeApp.md directive violations in UserDetailPage components\" so I should focus on the component/page files.\n\nLet me also quickly check the backend to see if there are any directive violations there, but wait - the backend is checked separately in a \"CheckBackend\" subtask. Let me just focus on the components.\n\n\nNow I'm checking another writeApp.md directive about the neon serverless driver, but that applies to backend code, not components. I need to be careful to distinguish between what's actually in the Directives section versus the Tips section of writeApp.md.\n\nLooking at the full list of directives from lines 52-103, I see they cover everything from running npm checks and matching mockups, to requiring data-testid attributes, handling database conversions, using searchable dropdowns for modals, avoiding native select elements, and ensuring attachments display proper file-type icons with actual upload support. There's also a requirement about consistent padding on every page component that appears to be cut off.\n\nI've verified the UserDetailPage components against these guidelines — the clickable divs in OwnedDealsList and AssignedTasksList could use better accessibility attributes like role=\"button\", though that's not explicitly in the directives, and I've confirmed no native select elements are being used. Everything else checks out from a writeApp.md perspective, so I'm moving forward to subtask 3.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":157,"cache_read_input_tokens":52798,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":157,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ed697034-7d4f-489a-b949-ae3c47e64c10","uuid":"66ef2982-cca9-44d0-ad9a-6cc39e0ca6fe"}

The tests.md file has 30+ test entries for UserDetailPage, but no test files exist for it. However, this isn't strictly a writeTests.md directive violation - the absence of tests means there's nothing to check directives against. But it's notable.\n\nActually, looking at the subtask more carefully: \"Check writeTests.md directive violations in UserDetailPage tests\". If there are no tests, there's nothing to check. But I should note that tests haven't been written yet.\n\nWait, but the other pages also might not have tests yet. Let me look at what test files exist:\n\n\n- tests/sidebar.spec.ts - for sidebar tests\n- tests/deployment.spec.ts - for deployment tests\n\nSo it looks like only sidebar and deployment have actual test files, while UserDetailPage and other pages don't. Since there are no test files to check against the writeTests.md directives, there's nothing to violate - the checkDirectives.md skill is specifically looking for directive violations, not whether tests exist in the first place.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6879,"cache_read_input_tokens":54728,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6879,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ed697034-7d4f-489a-b949-ae3c47e64c10","uuid":"f85ed220-1c2c-4256-8421-09ed8a74e9e3"}
