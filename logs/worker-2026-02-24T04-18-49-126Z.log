Always check `deployment.txt` first.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **Environment variables**:\n  - `NEON_API_KEY` (required): For Neon project/database management.\n  - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` (required): For Netlify CLI authentication.\n  - `NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG` (required): For Netlify site creation.\n- **Files**:\n  - `.env`: Read for existing project info (`NEON_PROJECT_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`,\n    `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`). Written to on first run.\n  - `deployment.txt`: Contains `site_id`, `neon_project_id`, and `database_url` from the\n    last deployment (committed to git). Use this to populate `.env` when deploying in a\n    fresh environment.\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **`.env`**: Updated with `NEON_PROJECT_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`, `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` if created.\n- **`deployment.txt`**: Updated with the current deployed URL, `site_id`, `neon_project_id`,\n  and `database_url`.\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates Neon project (first run only).\n  - Syncs production database schema (every run).\n  - Creates Netlify site (first run only).\n  - Deploys built app to Netlify (every run).\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: Deployment succeeded.\n  - Non-zero: A step failed (error printed to stderr).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` for schema sync.\n- Reuse migration logic from `scripts/migrate-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon REST API (`https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) with `NEON_API_KEY` for\n  project creation.\n- Use `netlify sites:create --account-slug $NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG` for site creation.\n- Use `netlify deploy --prod --dir dist --functions ./netlify/functions` for deployment.\n- Read/write `.env` using `fs` — parse as key=value lines, append new entries, don't\n  clobber existing values.\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development\n  bundle (see `vite.config.ts` settings) so Replay recordings show readable source.\n","numLines":99,"startLine":1,"totalLines":99}}}

Let me look at what apps are already available before I start unpacking the script implementation tasks.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":324,"cache_read_input_tokens":29837,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":324,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"2568dc04-4885-4a15-9e3f-48238efff66c","uuid":"cf85d44f-cd36-4ac5-92e1-d43d891ca74b"}

The per-app scripts would live in `apps/InventoryTracker/scripts/`. \n\nNow I need to understand what \"Unpack\" means here. Looking at the AGENTS.md: \"When a strategy needs to 'unpack' into sub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\"\n\nSo the task is asking me to \"unpack\" - meaning I should break down the work of implementing package scripts into individual subtasks and add them to the queue. I should NOT implement them myself.\n\nThe three script design docs are: check, deploy, test. \n\nI see that each script has its own design doc and should get its own subtask, but they all depend on shared modules like `schema.ts`, `seed-db.ts`, and `migrate-db.ts` that aren't independent scripts themselves. Since the InventoryTracker app doesn't have source code yet, the scripts reference things that don't exist, so I need to create tasks for implementing each of the three scripts. the specific script to implement. The format is typically like \"AppName: Description\".
