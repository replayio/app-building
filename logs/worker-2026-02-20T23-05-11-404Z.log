So the violation described in the job might have already been fixed, or the line numbers have shifted.\n\nBut the job says: \"Fix deals.ts line 293 using ?? null instead of || null for UUID column client_id\"\n\nWait, maybe the original violation was about a different line. Let me re-read the job description. It says \"Fix deals.ts line 293 using ?? null instead of || null for UUID column client_id\". \n\nLooking at the grep results, line 293 already has `??`. But let me check - maybe there's another client_id related line that uses `|| null`? Let me look at the CSV import section on line 190:\n\n\nI see there are several places using `|| null` - line 190 has it for `owner` and `expected_close_date`, and lines 223 and 298 also use `|| null` for `expected_close_date`. So the issue might not be specifically about `client_id` at line 293, but rather these other fields that need the nullish coalescing operator instead. Scanning through the remaining `|| null` instances, they're all in filter variables or non-UUID columns like `owner` and `expected_close_date`, so none of them actually violate the constraint that was being fixed. The fix for using `?? null` instead of `|| null` on line 293 for the `client_id` UUID column is already in place, so I can move forward with running the tests to verify everything works correctly.","signature":"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

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure.

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.

The fix was likely applied in a previous iteration. \n\nNow I'm looking for the test files to run the deal-related tests.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5838,"cache_read_input_tokens":28345,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5838,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5e5ffa55-bc21-44be-a9e6-72806901d9eb","uuid":"7617ecb2-4f33-4a99-9dd5-a273dcb21263"}
