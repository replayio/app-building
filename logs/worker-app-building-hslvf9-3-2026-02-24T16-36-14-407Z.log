The remote renamed it, and local might have modified it. Let me check this. Actually let me look at what happened with that file.\n\nWait, let me think more carefully. The merge base is `5621e98`. The local branch modified files in `apps/SalesCRM/` and also `jobs/jobs.json`. The remote branch renamed `strategies` to `skills`, renamed `jobs` to `tasks`, etc. The `--theirs` resolution would have taken the remote version for any conflicting files. \n\nSo `jobs/jobs.json` was the only conflicting file. \n\nNow I need to verify that the remote renamed it to something like `tasks/tasks-*.json` and check whether the SalesCRM app changes are still there after the merge.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":592,"cache_read_input_tokens":30661,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":592,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7ce71b7f-4a3d-47eb-8686-30bb1dd18e23","uuid":"45abc9fc-e7ba-49b3-92cb-d2ef926cdcd0"}

The merge with `--theirs` kept the remote's changes. The key things to check:\n\n1. The old `jobs/jobs.json` still exists and contains tasks referencing old `strategies/jobs/` paths. This is stale - the remote renamed everything to `skills/tasks/`. The old tasks in `jobs/jobs.json` are queued tasks that were pending on the local branch. They reference old paths.\n\n2. The SalesCRM app is intact (all files present).\n\n3. The current task queue is in `tasks/tasks-app-building-hslvf9.json` which has the current tasks.\n   \nI need to handle the stale tasks in `jobs/jobs.json` - the three pending tasks about ClientDetailPage testing and documentation all reference the old path structure and should either be migrated to use the new `skills/tasks/` paths or removed entirely since they may already be captured in the current task queue. I need to check whether those remaining FixViolation tasks from jobs.json are still relevant or if they were already completed before the merge. Looking at the current task queue, I see that resolveConflicts.md is what I'm working on now, followed by multiple analyzeLogs.md tasks and then synthesizeReport, updateSkills, and mergeSkills—so the old jobs.json file appears to be a leftover from the previous system that should be cleaned up, with any still-pending work migrated to the new format if necessary.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4848,"cache_read_input_tokens":32928,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4848,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":9,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7ce71b7f-4a3d-47eb-8686-30bb1dd18e23","uuid":"79ba7b29-1536-4f04-84a3-0a1d8a0ee183"}
