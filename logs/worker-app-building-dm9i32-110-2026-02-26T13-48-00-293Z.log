This file is organized by page, with one or more test entries for the page.\n    28→\n    29→- The test entries must match the app spec as closely as possible.\n    30→- If there are image URLs in the app spec, you MUST download them, read them from disk, and follow them carefully.\n    31→- Use behavior driven development to formulate test entries: describe the initial conditions of the app's state, the action the user takes, and the changes to the app that should occur afterwards.\n    32→- Test entries must all have titles.\n    33→- Test entries must be grouped by page in the app.\n    34→- Test entries must indicate the components on that page they are exercising.\n    35→- Every interactive element (buttons etc) in the component must be tested. There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→* If the app has symmetrical or reciprocal relationships (e.g., contact relationships, mutual links between entities), creating/updating/deleting one side must automatically update the other side. Test entries must verify both sides of the relationship are in sync.\n    69→\n    70→## Tips\n    71→\n    72→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    73→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    74→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    75→  to PlanPage subtasks. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    76→- The PlanPages subtask must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    77→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen. Read AppSpec.md and the\n    78→  mockup images directly, decide on pages/components, write docs/tests.md scaffolding, update\n    79→  Prioritize writing output over exhaustive exploration.\n    80→- Download all mockup images in a single curl command, then read them all in parallel. Do not\n    81→  interleave downloads and reads.\n    82→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_0151gqpPWo78NpNwdDfUVbc3","session_id":"16cc40bf-09d1-4308-9f9a-c31b546ec23b","uuid":"8f270b6e-3803-46a0-9e95-365fb13cced4"}

Looking at the testSpec.md directives, specifically:\n\n> For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous.\n\nIn the SalesCRM tests.md, the clients actions menu (lines 188-192) mentions Edit and Delete as options, but there's no specific test entry for what the Edit action does. There IS a test entry for Delete (line 203-204: \"Deleted client is removed from table\"), but no test entry for Edit.\n\nThe deals page has an \"Actions menu Edit option opens edit deal modal\" entry. For clients, the subtask says to \"Add test entry for Edit action in actions menu specifying navigation to /clients/:clientId\".\n\n\nSo the Edit action for clients should navigate to the detail page at `/clients/:clientId` rather than opening a modal like it does for deals.

No Dashboard, Reports, or other placeholder links are shown.\n\n**Clients link navigates to /clients**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Clients\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /clients and the ClientsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Contacts link navigates to /contacts**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Contacts\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /contacts and the ContactsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Deals link navigates to /deals**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Deals\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /deals and the DealsListPage is displayed.\n\n**Tasks link navigates to /tasks**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Tasks\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /tasks and the TasksListPage is displayed.\n\n**Team link navigates to /users**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Team\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /users and the UsersListPage is displayed.\n\n**Settings link navigates to /settings**\nGiven the user is on any page, when they click the \"Settings\" link in the sidebar, the app navigates to /settings and the SettingsPage is displayed.\n\n**Active link is visually highlighted for current page**\nGiven the user is on /clients, the \"Clients\" sidebar link has a visually distinct active state (e.g., highlighted background or bold text), and all other links appear in their default inactive style. The same highlighting applies to whichever page is current — navigating to /deals highlights \"Deals\", navigating to /tasks highlights \"Tasks\", etc.\n\n**Active state updates on navigation**\nGiven the user is on /clients with the \"Clients\" link highlighted, when they click the \"Deals\" link, the highlight moves from \"Clients\" to \"Deals\" and the app navigates to /deals.\n\n**Sidebar persists across page navigation**\nWhen the user navigates between pages (e.g., from /clients to /deals to /tasks), the sidebar remains visible and does not re-mount or lose state.\n\n#### SidebarAuth\n\n**Sign In button displays when not authenticated**\nGiven the user is not logged in, the sidebar user area (upper left, below the app title) shows a \"Sign In\" button. No avatar, name, or sign-out control is visible.\n\n**Clicking Sign In reveals inline auth form**\nGiven the user is not authenticated, when they click the \"Sign In\" button, an inline form appears within the sidebar containing: an email input field, a password input field, a \"Sign In\" submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch to \"Sign Up\" mode.\n\n**Sign In form submission with valid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters a valid email and password and clicks the \"Sign In\" submit button, the user is authenticated, the inline form disappears, and the sidebar user area shows the user's avatar (or initials), name, and a sign-out button.\n\n**Sign In form shows error for invalid credentials**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user enters an invalid email/password combination and clicks \"Sign In\", an error message is displayed within the form and the form remains visible for correction.\n\n**Sign In / Sign Up toggle switches form mode**\nGiven the inline auth form is visible in Sign In mode, when the user clicks the \"Sign Up\" toggle, the form switches to Sign Up mode — the submit button text changes to \"Sign Up\" and the toggle text changes to allow switching back to \"Sign In\".
