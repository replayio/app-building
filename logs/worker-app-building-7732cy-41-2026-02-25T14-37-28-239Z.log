Difficulty Analysis\n\n### Commands That Frequently Required Multiple Attempts\n\n1. **`npx tsc --noEmit`** — The most common multi-attempt command. Typically the first run reveals type errors (implicit `any`, unused imports, missing type fields), which the agent fixes before re-running. This is expected behavior during iterative development.\n\n2. **`npm run check`** — Similar to tsc, the quality gate often catches issues on first run that require fixing. The pattern of \"run check → fix errors → run check again\" accounts for many multi-attempt instances.\n\n3. **`npx eslint`** — Frequently problematic. Three distinct failure patterns:\n   - No eslint config existed for some apps (ProductionHub, SupplierTracker), causing \"no config found\" partial failures\n   - Agent retried the same failing command multiple times without resolving the root cause (log knfcm0-46)\n   - Agent ran `npx eslint . --fix` in apps that didn't have eslint configured\n\n4. **`npx playwright test --config playwright.deployment.config.ts`** — Deployment tests often failed on first attempt due to:\n   - Wrong `data-testid` values in the test\n   - Elements not visible in empty-state pages\n   - ESM `__dirname` issues in test config\n\n5. **`npx netlify env:get/env:set`** — Failed consistently with \"No project id found\" errors. The agent had to resort to using the Netlify REST API via `curl` instead.\n\n### Commands That Frequently Failed\n\n1. **`npx netlify env:set DATABASE_URL`** — Failed because the Netlify CLI couldn't find the project context. The agent worked around this by using the Netlify API directly with `curl`.\n\n2. **`npx eslint . --fix`** (in certain apps) — Failed three times consecutively in log knfcm0-46 without resolution. The underlying issue was a missing eslint configuration.\n\n3. **`curl` to deployed API endpoints** — Initial API calls to freshly deployed apps returned 500 errors because DATABASE_URL wasn't set as an environment variable on Netlify.\n\n### Patterns in What Made Commands Difficult\n\n- **Environment configuration gaps**: DATABASE_URL not being set on Netlify after deployment was a recurring blocker across multiple logs (knfcm0-17, knfcm0-32, knfcm0-52).\n- **Missing tool configuration**: ESLint not being configured for some apps caused repeated failures. The agent sometimes retried instead of recognizing the config was absent.\n- **Netlify CLI limitations**: The Netlify CLI (`npx netlify`) frequently failed for env var operations. The REST API proved more reliable.\n- **Deployment test fragility**: Tests assumed specific elements would be visible, but empty-state pages or data variations caused failures on first run.\n- **Case sensitivity in paths**: One instance of `ls /repo/apps/accounting/` (wrong case) when the directory was `Accounting/`.\n\n### Agent Workarounds That Succeeded\n\n- **Netlify API via curl** instead of `npx netlify env:set` — Successfully set environment variables when the CLI failed.\n- **Running `npm run check` from the app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`) instead of using standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` — More reliable because it uses the app's tsconfig.\n- **Iterative test-fix-retest cycles** — The agent effectively used multiple test runs with Replay recordings to debug and fix test failures (log knfcm0-30: from 24/35 passing to 35/35 in 6 runs).\n- **Using `npx netlify logs:function`** instead of `netlify functions:log` — Found the correct CLI subcommand after the first attempt failed.\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\n### `skills/scripts/*.md` — Script Design Updates\n\n1. **Create `skills/scripts/netlify-env.md`**: Document the pattern for setting Netlify environment variables. The `npx netlify env:set` command consistently failed. The skill should recommend using the Netlify REST API:\n   ```\n   curl -s -X POST \"https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/accounts/.../env?site_id=...\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer $NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '[{\"key\":\"DATABASE_URL\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"...\",\"context\":\"all\"}]}]'\n   ```\n\n2. **Update `skills/scripts/check.md`**: Add guidance that `npm run check` should be run from the **app directory** (not the repo root with standalone `npx tsc`), and document that ESLint requires a config file — if none exists, skip linting or create one first rather than retrying the same command.\n\n3. **Create `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`**: Document the post-deploy verification steps: (1) set DATABASE_URL env var on Netlify, (2) verify API endpoints return 200, (3) then run deployment tests. This would prevent the pattern seen in knfcm0-17 and knfcm0-32 where tests failed because the database wasn't configured.\n\n### Task Skills Updates\n\n4. **`skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md`**: Add a reminder that after writing components, the agent should run `npm run check` from the app directory rather than standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. This avoids tsconfig resolution issues seen in logs knfcm0-8 and knfcm0-85.\n\n5. **`skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`** (or equivalent test skill): Add guidance for deployment tests:\n   - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup\n   - Handle empty-state scenarios (tables/lists with no data should be handled gracefully)\n   - Use `{ timeout: 10000 }` or similar for elements that may load slowly on first deploy\n\n### Standard Procedures to Document\n\n6. **ESLint configuration**: The agent should check for `.eslintrc.*` or `eslint.config.*` before running `npx eslint`. If no config exists, either create a minimal one or skip linting (don't retry the command expecting different results).\n\n7. **File exploration pattern**: The agent used `ls` (285 times) and `find` (240 times) extensively for codebase exploration. Consider documenting that the Glob and Grep tools should be preferred over shell `find`/`ls`/`grep` for file exploration, as this would reduce shell command volume and provide better structured output.\n\n8. **Mockup download pattern**: The agent downloaded ~25 mockup images via `curl -L -o /tmp/...`. This pattern works well and should remain as-is, but could be documented as a standard procedure in the writeApp skill.\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":452,"cache_read_input_tokens":65282,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":452,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5fcda595-4caf-4165-b570-0c0f66b8570a","uuid":"5831dc7f-4f99-4bd3-a1ea-04fd1e8325da"}

Difficulty Analysis\n\n### Commands That Frequently Required Multiple Attempts\n\n1. **`npx tsc --noEmit`** — The most common multi-attempt command. Typically the first run reveals type errors (implicit `any`, unused imports, missing type fields), which the agent fixes before re-running. This is expected behavior during iterative development.\n\n2. **`npm run check`** — Similar to tsc, the quality gate often catches issues on first run that require fixing. The pattern of \"run check → fix errors → run check again\" accounts for many multi-attempt instances.\n\n3. **`npx eslint`** — Frequently problematic. Three distinct failure patterns:\n   - No eslint config existed for some apps (ProductionHub, SupplierTracker), causing \"no config found\" partial failures\n   - Agent retried the same failing command multiple times without resolving the root cause (log knfcm0-46)\n   - Agent ran `npx eslint . --fix` in apps that didn't have eslint configured\n\n4. **`npx playwright test --config playwright.deployment.config.ts`** — Deployment tests often failed on first attempt due to:\n   - Wrong `data-testid` values in the test\n   - Elements not visible in empty-state pages\n   - ESM `__dirname` issues in test config\n\n5. **`npx netlify env:get/env:set`** — Failed consistently with \"No project id found\" errors. The agent had to resort to using the Netlify REST API via `curl` instead.\n\n### Commands That Frequently Failed\n\n1. **`npx netlify env:set DATABASE_URL`** — Failed because the Netlify CLI couldn't find the project context. The agent worked around this by using the Netlify API directly with `curl`.\n\n2. **`npx eslint . --fix`** (in certain apps) — Failed three times consecutively in log knfcm0-46 without resolution. The underlying issue was a missing eslint configuration.\n\n3. **`curl` to deployed API endpoints** — Initial API calls to freshly deployed apps returned 500 errors because DATABASE_URL wasn't set as an environment variable on Netlify.\n\n### Patterns in What Made Commands Difficult\n\n- **Environment configuration gaps**: DATABASE_URL not being set on Netlify after deployment was a recurring blocker across multiple logs (knfcm0-17, knfcm0-32, knfcm0-52).\n- **Missing tool configuration**: ESLint not being configured for some apps caused repeated failures. The agent sometimes retried instead of recognizing the config was absent.\n- **Netlify CLI limitations**: The Netlify CLI (`npx netlify`) frequently failed for env var operations. The REST API proved more reliable.\n- **Deployment test fragility**: Tests assumed specific elements would be visible, but empty-state pages or data variations caused failures on first run.\n- **Case sensitivity in paths**: One instance of `ls /repo/apps/accounting/` (wrong case) when the directory was `Accounting/`.\n\n### Agent Workarounds That Succeeded\n\n- **Netlify API via curl** instead of `npx netlify env:set` — Successfully set environment variables when the CLI failed.\n- **Running `npm run check` from the app directory** (`cd /repo/apps/AppName && npm run check`) instead of using standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` — More reliable because it uses the app's tsconfig.\n- **Iterative test-fix-retest cycles** — The agent effectively used multiple test runs with Replay recordings to debug and fix test failures (log knfcm0-30: from 24/35 passing to 35/35 in 6 runs).\n- **Using `npx netlify logs:function`** instead of `netlify functions:log` — Found the correct CLI subcommand after the first attempt failed.\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n\n### `skills/scripts/*.md` — Script Design Updates\n\n1. **Create `skills/scripts/netlify-env.md`**: Document the pattern for setting Netlify environment variables. The `npx netlify env:set` command consistently failed. The skill should recommend using the Netlify REST API:\n   ```\n   curl -s -X POST \"https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/accounts/.../env?site_id=...\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer $NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '[{\"key\":\"DATABASE_URL\",\"values\":[{\"value\":\"...\",\"context\":\"all\"}]}]'\n   ```\n\n2. **Update `skills/scripts/check.md`**: Add guidance that `npm run check` should be run from the **app directory** (not the repo root with standalone `npx tsc`), and document that ESLint requires a config file — if none exists, skip linting or create one first rather than retrying the same command.\n\n3. **Create `skills/scripts/deploy-verification.md`**: Document the post-deploy verification steps: (1) set DATABASE_URL env var on Netlify, (2) verify API endpoints return 200, (3) then run deployment tests. This would prevent the pattern seen in knfcm0-17 and knfcm0-32 where tests failed because the database wasn't configured.\n\n### Task Skills Updates\n\n4. **`skills/tasks/build/writeApp.md`**: Add a reminder that after writing components, the agent should run `npm run check` from the app directory rather than standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` at the repo root. This avoids tsconfig resolution issues seen in logs knfcm0-8 and knfcm0-85.\n\n5. **`skills/tasks/build/writeTests.md`** (or equivalent test skill): Add guidance for deployment tests:\n   - Always use `data-testid` values that match the actual component markup\n   - Handle empty-state scenarios (tables/lists with no data should be handled gracefully)\n   - Use `{ timeout: 10000 }` or similar for elements that may load slowly on first deploy\n\n### Standard Procedures to Document\n\n6. **ESLint configuration**: The agent should check for `.eslintrc.*` or `eslint.config.*` before running `npx eslint`. If no config exists, either create a minimal one or skip linting (don't retry the command expecting different results).\n\n7. **File exploration pattern**: The agent used `ls` (285 times) and `find` (240 times) extensively for codebase exploration. Consider documenting that the Glob and Grep tools should be preferred over shell `find`/`ls`/`grep` for file exploration, as this would reduce shell command volume and provide better structured output.\n\n8. **Mockup download pattern**: The agent downloaded ~25 mockup images via `curl -L -o /tmp/...`. This pattern works well and should remain as-is, but could be documented as a standard procedure in the writeApp skill.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
