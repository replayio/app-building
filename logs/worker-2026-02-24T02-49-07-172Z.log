If a matching strategy exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching strategy exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   strategy document in `strategies/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching strategy. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes job groups from `jobs/jobs.json` sequentially. For each group,\nit passes all jobs to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the group is dequeued and the worker moves to the next group.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the group is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each group automatically. Focus on completing the\njobs — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL jobs in your group, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Job System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON job queue at `jobs/jobs.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `groups` array. Each group has a `strategy`, an array of `jobs` (description strings),\nand a `timestamp`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"groups\": [\n    {\n      \"strategy\": \"strategies/jobs/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"jobs\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes `jobs.json` directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-group.ts --strategy \"<path>\" --job \"desc1\" --job \"desc2\"`**:\n  Adds a job group to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--job` flag\n  adds one job to the group. Jobs execute in the order listed.\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll jobs in a group share the same strategy. Group related jobs together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one group. When a strategy needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-groups, use `add-group` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Job scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on jobs that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  jobs are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new job groups via `add-group`, you MUST NOT start working on those jobs.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned jobs and the only remaining work is jobs you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued jobs.\n- Adding jobs to the queue is NOT the same as doing those jobs. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions. Place functions in `netlify/functions/`. Use `netlify dev` for local development.\n- **File Storage** use UploadThing with the provided token for any file storage.\n\n## Database\n\nAll database accesses must happen in backend Netlify functions. Netlify functions should be focused\nand operate on specific parts of the database corresponding to the needs of one or more specific\nfrontend components.\n\n## Quality Gates\n\nBefore each commit, run `npm run check` (see `strategies/scripts/check.md`). Do not commit\ncode that fails typecheck or lint.\n\n## Commits\n\nThe worker commits automatically after each iteration. Do not commit manually unless\nexplicitly asked to by a strategy or prompt.\n","numLines":112,"startLine":1,"totalLines":112}}}

The backend individuals list endpoint returns enriched data including associated client names for display.\n    18→\n    19→## Sidebar Navigation\n    20→\n    21→Sidebar navigation contains Clients, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Team, and Settings links. Dashboard, Reports, and other placeholder links were removed as they had no corresponding pages.\n    22→\n    23→## Filter Dropdowns\n    24→\n    25→Filter dropdowns on the deals page and elsewhere use custom styled dropdown components instead of native HTML select elements, matching the app's design system. FilterSelect dropdowns with many options include a searchable search input. When `searchable` is enabled, a search field appears at the top of the dropdown that filters options as you type, auto-focuses when opened, and shows \"No matches\" when no options match. Applied to client, user, and deal select dropdowns across filter bars, create/edit modals, and detail page headers.\n    26→\n    27→## Pipeline Drag-and-Drop\n    28→\n    29→Pipeline view on the deals page supports drag-and-drop to move deals between stage columns. Deal cards are draggable and dropping on a different column updates the deal's stage via the API.\n    30→\n    31→## Authentication\n    32→\n    33→Authentication is optional. The sidebar user area is in the upper left (below app title), showing avatar/name/sign-out when logged in or a \"Sign In\" button when not logged in. Clicking \"Sign In\" reveals an inline auth form with email/password fields, a submit button, a \"Forgot password?\" link, and a toggle to switch between Sign In and Sign Up modes. Backend functions use optional auth middleware that passes user info when available but allows unauthenticated requests. Timeline events and writeup authors fall back to \"System\" when no user is authenticated. All Netlify Functions are wrapped with JWT verification middleware (optional mode).\n    34→\n    35→Email/password signup requires email confirmation before the user can log in. After signing up, the user receives a confirmation email (via Resend API) with a link to /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms the account and logs them in. In test mode (IS_TEST=true), signup auto-confirms and returns a session immediately.\n    36→\n    37→A \"Forgot password?\" link in the sign-in form navigates to /auth/forgot-password, where the user enters their email to receive a password reset link (via Resend API). The reset link goes to /auth/reset-password?token=... where they enter a new password and confirm it. On success, the password is updated and the user is logged in.\n    38→\n    39→Three auth pages exist: ForgotPasswordPage (/auth/forgot-password), ResetPasswordPage (/auth/reset-password), and ConfirmEmailPage (/auth/confirm-email). The email_tokens database table stores confirmation and reset tokens with expiry and used-at tracking.\n    40→\n    41→## Close Date Sort Arrow Indicator\n    42→\n    43→The Close Date column header in the deals table now shows directional arrow icons that reflect the current sort direction: ArrowDown when sorted descending (newest first), ArrowUp when sorted ascending (oldest first), and ArrowUpDown when not sorted by close date. A `data-sort-direction` attribute on the sort button exposes the current direction for testing. Previously the icon was always a static ArrowUpDown regardless of sort state.\n    44→\n    45→## CSV Import and Export\n    46→\n    47→CSV import is available for clients, deals, contacts/individuals, and tasks. Each entity type has a CSV column format specification table listing all supported columns with required/optional indicators and value descriptions, plus a \"Download CSV template\" button. The import parses CSV with proper quote handling, maps headers to database fields, and reports per-row validation errors. Backend bulk import endpoints validate types, statuses, and required fields.\n    48→\n    49→CSV formats:\n    50→- Clients: Name, Type, Status, Tags, Source Type, Source Detail, Campaign, Channel, Date Acquired\n    51→- Deals: Name, Client Name, Value, Stage, Owner, Probability, Expected Close Date, Status (client lookup by name)\n    52→- Tasks: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority, Client Name, Assignee (client lookup by name)\n    53→- Contacts: Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, Client Name (creates individuals, optionally associates with clients by name)\n    54→\n    55→A shared ImportDialog component is used across all entity types.\n    56→\n    57→## Settings Page\n    58→\n    59→A Settings page exists at /settings with sidebar navigation link. Three sections:\n    60→1. **Email Notifications** — notification preference toggles for email alerts on followed clients. Seven toggleable preferences: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, note added. All default to enabled. Only visible when authenticated. Preferences stored in notification_preferences database table, managed via /.netlify/functions/notification-preferences API.\n    61→2. **Import & Export** — buttons to import clients, deals, tasks, and contacts from CSV, and export clients, deals, and tasks to CSV.\n    62→3. **Webhooks** — CRUD for webhook configurations that send notifications to external services (Zapier, n8n, Discord) on events like new client created, deal stage changed, task completed, etc. Webhook management includes add/edit modal with name, URL, and event checkboxes; enable/disable toggle; and delete with confirmation. Added webhooks database table and CRUD API endpoint.\n    63→\n    64→## Webhook Setup Guides\n    65→\n    66→Webhook modal includes platform-specific setup guides for Zapier, n8n, and custom endpoints. Each guide shows step-by-step instructions for obtaining the webhook URL, a URL format hint, and platform-specific tips (e.g., Zapier needs the first event to detect the schema; n8n has separate test vs production URLs). A toggleable payload format section shows the JSON structure that webhook events will send. The URL input placeholder updates based on the selected platform.\n    67→\n    68→## Team Page and User Management\n    69→\n    70→A Team page (UsersListPage) exists at /users and a User Detail page (UserDetailPage) at /users/:userId. Team page shows a grid of user cards with avatar, name, email, active deals count, and open tasks count. User Detail page shows user info (name, email, join date), summary stats (active deals, open tasks, total deals), and three sections: owned deals list, assigned tasks list, and recent activity feed. A /.netlify/functions/users API endpoint provides GET list with stats and GET detail with deals/tasks/activity. 9 team members are seeded.\n    71→\n    72→Deal owner and task assignee fields in CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal show a user selection dropdown (FilterSelect) populated from the users API instead of free-form text input.\n    73→\n    74→## Client Following and Email Notifications\n    75→\n    76→Authenticated users can follow/unfollow clients via a toggle button on the client detail page. Following a client subscribes the user to email notifications (via Resend API) when changes occur on that client. Notification types include: client updated, deal created, deal stage changed, task created, task completed, contact added, and note added. Users can configure which notification types they receive on the Settings page via individual toggles (all enabled by default). The actor who triggered the change does not receive a notification. Notifications are sent asynchronously (fire-and-forget) and do not block API responses.\n    77→\n    78→Two new database tables: `client_followers` (junction table for user-client follow relationships with unique constraint) and `notification_preferences` (per-user toggle preferences with defaults of all true). Two new API endpoints: `/.netlify/functions/client-follow` (GET to check follow status, POST to toggle follow; requires auth) and `/.netlify/functions/notification-preferences` (GET/PUT for preferences; requires auth). Existing API functions for clients, deals, tasks, and contacts trigger follower notifications when creating timeline events.\n    79→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"45251350-c864-4687-8f74-e1f8824985a8","uuid":"fdad3309-4564-4315-96a4-59159dd5d3f5","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/repo/apps/SalesCRM/AppRevisions.md","content":"# App Revisions\n\nNew functionality and spec changes beyond the original AppSpec.md, organized by topic.\n\n## Attachment Displays\n\nAttachment displays show file-type-specific icons (Document, Image, Spreadsheet, Code, etc.) and render thumbnail previews for image files, on both the client detail page and deal detail page. Upload modals support both file upload (with file picker) and link URL modes via a toggle.\n\n## Task Detail Page\n\nA TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\n\nTask links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\n\n## Contacts Page\n\nA Contacts page (ContactsListPage) exists at /contacts, accessible from the sidebar. It lists all individuals/contacts in the system with a searchable table showing Name, Title, Email, Phone, Location, and Associated Clients columns. Search filters across name, email, title, phone, and location fields with debounced input. Supports pagination (50 per page), CSV import/export, and adding new contacts via a modal form.

Let me also read the TasksListPage section to understand the existing structure.\n\nNow let me assess what the three jobs require:\n\n1. **PlanPageTaskDetailPage**: \"Decide on components for TaskDetailPage, add sections to docs/tests.md\" - The component list is already there at line 2076: `Components: TaskDetailHeader, TaskDetailInfo, TaskNotesSection, EditTaskModal`. The sections and test entries already exist. But wait, the job says \"Decide on components\" and \"add sections\" - let me check if it's asking me to add more. Looking at the AppRevisions.md, the Task Detail Page has: title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, notes section with add/delete notes. \n\nChecking the existing test coverage, I can see that TaskDetailHeader already handles mark complete and cancel actions along with all the other expected behaviors, TaskDetailInfo covers the metadata fields, TaskNotesSection manages the notes functionality, and EditTaskModal handles all the form interactions and validations. Everything appears to be accounted for in the current documentation. I'm checking off the elements against the spec: title, priority, status, and due date are all accounted for in the existing tests. But I'm noticing the assignee is listed as a display field rather than an interactive dropdown—the spec specifically calls for an \"assignee user dropdown,\" which suggests it should be editable directly on the detail page, not just in a modal. Let me look at what AppRevisions.md actually describes to clarify what the component should include. to user detail). The existing tests cover all this, but I'm realizing the job description might be asking for something different—the \"assignee user dropdown\" phrasing suggests the assignee should be editable directly on the task detail page via a dropdown, not just displayed as a link or changed through an edit modal.

[2026-02-24T02:48:50.101Z] {"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-opus-4-6","id":"msg_01Bwnm91uFbnfSx7FkUF6uPX","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"Now I have a comprehensive view of what already exists. The TaskDetailPage section at line 2074 already has:\n- Components: TaskDetailHeader, TaskDetailInfo, TaskNotesSection, EditTaskModal\n- TaskDetailHeader: tests for title, priority badge, status badge, back button, edit button, mark complete, cancel task, action buttons hidden\n- TaskDetailInfo: tests for due date, assignee, client, deal, optional fields, description, empty description\n- TaskNotesSection: tests for notes display, add note form, submit note, disabled submit, delete note, empty state\n- EditTaskModal: tests for pre-populated data, form fields, validation, save changes, priority dropdown, client/assignee dropdowns, cancel, overlay close\n\n\nLooking at the job descriptions, most of the required test coverage is already documented, though I should verify whether the assignee field is specifically tested as a user dropdown component rather than just a generic assignee field.\n\nChecking the AppRevisions more carefully, I notice they specify which modals and headers should have user selection dropdowns—EditTaskModal is mentioned, but TaskDetailHeader isn't. This suggests the assignee on TaskDetailPage is meant to be a display-only link rather than an editable dropdown, which aligns with what the existing tests show. I'm realizing the job description mentions an \"assignee user dropdown\" on the task detail page, but the AppRevisions only specify it for the EditTaskModal, not the TaskDetailPage itself. The assignee currently displays as a read-only field with a link on the detail page, and users can change it through the modal. I think I should stick with what the AppRevisions document says—the dropdown belongs in the EditTaskModal, which the existing tests already cover. Now I'm checking whether the test coverage is comprehensive enough against the job requirements, looking at each field mentioned in Job 2 to see what's already tested. I'm realizing the existing test coverage might already be complete from a previous iteration, but I need to verify whether the component names in the tests actually match what the job is asking for—specifically whether \"TaskDetails\" as a component name is being used or if the tests are organized under different component names like \"TaskDetailHeader\" and \"TaskDetailInfo.\"\n\nLet me do a final verification by checking the git status to confirm these sections are committed, then systematically go through each job requirement to see if there are any gaps in the coverage. Everything is covered. The tests already exist.\n\nBut wait—the jobs mention \"add test entries\" and \"add sections,\" yet the content is already there. This suggests a previous iteration already completed this work. Looking at the commit history, I can see earlier iterations handled TasksListPage and DealDetailPage, but these current jobs are specifically for TaskDetailPage. Let me verify whether this section was already added in a prior commit or if I'm looking at work that's already been done.\n\nThe real question is whether I should consider this complete since the content exists, or if there's something missing that needs enhancement based on the behavior-driven development requirements and the app spec.\n\nLooking at the spec more carefully, I notice the existing tests cover the main functionality described—navigation, display of task details, notes management, and status changes. But since there's no mockup for TaskDetailPage to systematically inventory against, I'm working from the text spec alone, and I'm spotting a gap: there's no test for the assignee dropdown as a direct edit control on the detail page, which is mentioned in the DealDetailPage pattern.\n\nHowever, re-reading the AppRevisions, I see that task assignee fields are only listed for CreateTaskModal and EditTaskModal, not for TaskDetailHeader. So the current approach of editing assignees through the modal is correct, and the existing tests already reflect this properly.\n\nI'm confident the work is complete and the tests accurately cover the spec requirements. I should document this assessment and mark the jobs as done.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider—these jobs are still in my queue, which means they haven't been marked complete yet. Let me look more carefully at the test coverage against the strategy directives to see if there are any gaps or improvements I should make.\n\nLooking at the details, I notice a few potential issues: the assignee display test doesn't verify whether the user's role or title is shown like it is on the task card, and there's no coverage for edge cases like navigating to a non-existent task ID, though that might be outside the scope of these particular jobs.\n\nThe real question is what these jobs are actually asking for—the PlanPage job wants me to decide on components and add section headers to the docs, while the PlanComponent jobs want actual test entries written. If some of this work was already done in previous iterations, I should verify what's complete and fill in any remaining gaps.\n\nNow I'm checking the existing content against the requirements: all elements from the spec are covered, the BDD format is consistent throughout, everything's organized under TaskDetailPage, components are listed, and I can confirm every interactive element—from the back button through the delete note button—has a corresponding test entry.\n\nBut wait, I need to reconsider the job description more carefully. It specifically mentions \"assignee user dropdown\" as a distinct interactive element, which suggests the assignee field itself should function as a dropdown on the TaskDetailPage, not just a link. Let me think about whether I've actually tested that interaction or if I've only tested the link behavior.\n\nActually, looking back at the AppRevisions spec, the FilterSelect dropdown for assignee is only listed for CreateDealModal, AddDealModal, DealDetailHeader, CreateTaskModal, and EditTaskModal. TaskDetailHeader isn't included, which means the assignee display on the task detail page is read-only—you can only edit it through the EditTaskModal. So \"assignee user dropdown\" in the job description probably just refers to the assignee field that displays and links to the user, plus the dropdown functionality available in the EditTaskModal for changing it.\n\nI'm confident this interpretation aligns with the spec, so I can move forward with marking this complete. the existing content is complete. Let me mark the jobs as done.\n\nActually, I realize I should look at the task detail page description more carefully from AppRevisions:\n\n\"A TaskDetailPage exists at /tasks/:taskId. Clicking a task card navigates to this page, which shows task title, priority, status, due date, assignee, associated client/deal, and a notes section where notes can be added and deleted. Includes a task_notes database table and GET/POST/DELETE API endpoints for notes. Tasks can be marked complete or canceled from this page.\"\n\nAnd: \"Task links on client detail page and deal detail page navigate to /tasks/:taskId.\"\n\nThis is fully covered in the existing tests.\n\nNow I'm reviewing the test structure one more time to make sure everything's accounted for. The TaskDetailHeader component has nine test entries covering the title, priority and status badges, navigation, editing, and task completion actions. TaskDetailInfo has seven entries validating the display of due dates, assignee and client links, deal associations, and description handling. TaskNotesSection has six entries for notes display, form submission, and deletion. EditTaskModal rounds it out with nine entries for pre-populated fields and modal behavior.\n\nThat's 31 test entries total, which is comprehensive coverage for the page's functionality.\n\nI'm reconsidering whether to add tests for task deletion or inline field editing, but the spec doesn't call for either—it specifies marking complete or canceling, and uses a modal for edits rather than inline changes.\n\nNow I'm checking the DealDetailHeader tests to see if TaskDetailPage should have a similar inline dropdown for the assignee field. Looking at how the owner field works in DealDetailPage—it's displayed as a FilterSelect dropdown in the header that updates the database and creates a history entry when changed. I need to verify whether TaskDetailPage should have the same pattern for its assignee field. The assignee shows as a link and can be edited through the EditTaskModal, which already has the necessary user dropdown tests. I've analyzed the requirements thoroughly—the job description's \"assignee user dropdown\" refers to the modal's functionality, not an inline component. Since tests.md already exists from previous work, I should wrap up and mark these jobs complete rather than overthinking further iterations. Looking through each mutation to verify side-effect testing—Mark Complete, Cancel Task, Submit Note, Delete Note, and Edit Task Save all have proper coverage for persistence and timeline entries.
