Written to on first run.\n  - `deployment.txt`: Contains `site_id`, `neon_project_id`, and `database_url` from the\n    last deployment (committed to git). Use this to populate `.env` when deploying in a\n    fresh environment.\n\n## Outputs\n\n- **`.env`**: Updated with `NEON_PROJECT_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`, `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` if created.\n- **`deployment.txt`**: Updated with the current deployed URL, `site_id`, `neon_project_id`,\n  and `database_url`.\n- **Side effects**:\n  - Creates Neon project (first run only).\n  - Syncs production database schema (every run).\n  - Creates Netlify site (first run only).\n  - Deploys built app to Netlify (every run).\n- **Exit codes**:\n  - 0: Deployment succeeded.\n  - Non-zero: A step failed (error printed to stderr).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- Reuse `initSchema` from `scripts/schema.ts` for schema sync.\n- Reuse migration logic from `scripts/migrate-db.ts`.\n- Use the Neon REST API (`https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/...`) with `NEON_API_KEY` for\n  project creation.\n- Use `netlify sites:create --account-slug $NETLIFY_ACCOUNT_SLUG` for site creation.\n- Use `netlify deploy --prod --dir dist --functions ./netlify/functions` for deployment.\n- Read/write `.env` using `fs` — parse as key=value lines, append new entries, don't\n  clobber existing values.\n- Production builds must use `sourcemap: true`, `minify: false`, and the React development\n  bundle (see `vite.config.ts` settings) so Replay recordings show readable source.\n","numLines":99,"startLine":1,"totalLines":99}}}

Each uses the `writeScript` skill.\n\nActually, wait - looking at the design docs more carefully:\n- `deploy.md` references `migrate-db` logic\n\n\n- `test.md` references `seed-db.ts` and `migrate-db.ts`\n\nBut the InventoryTracker already has `runMigrations()` in `schema.ts`, so there's no separate `migrate-db.ts` needed. For the seed-db, it's referenced in test.md as something test.ts needs to use. So I should create one task with subtasks for each of the three scripts to implement.\n\nLooking at the design docs available—check.md, deploy.md, test.md—there's no seed-db.md, but test.md explicitly mentions reusing seed logic from scripts/seed-db.ts. This means seed-db.ts needs to exist before test.ts can be implemented, so I should order the tasks accordingly: seed-db first, then test, then deploy.\n\nSince there's no design doc for seed-db, I'll treat its creation as part of the test implementation task—the test script implementer will naturally need to create seed-db.ts to fulfill the test requirements.\n\nNow I'm checking whether migrate-db.ts is also needed, since deploy.md references migration logic against the production database. Since there's no design doc for seed-db.ts, I should probably bundle it with the test.ts implementation since test.md explicitly references reusing seed logic from it. I'll create two writeScript subtasks: one for deploy.ts and one for test.ts, which will naturally include seed-db.ts as part of that work.","signature":"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
