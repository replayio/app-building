There must be a comment in the JSX next to every interactive element with the titles of the tests that exercise it.\n    36→- The test must verify that the interactive element actually works and does what the user expects. For example, clicking a button must do something, and text added to forms must be reflected in the app state afterwards.\n    37→- Adding extra necessary features beyond the app spec may be needed for a complete, functional app (e.g. create/delete buttons, navigation, form validation).\n    38→\n    39→## Directives\n    40→\n    41→- Images of different pages in the app spec might not have consistent styling or navigation elements with each other. Prioritize a consistent navigation / styling over exact adherence to the images.\n    42→\n    43→- Systematically inventory every visible element in each mockup — every column header, filter control, button, icon, badge, and section. Write a test entry for each one. It is easy to gloss over elements that seem minor or to only test the most prominent features.\n    44→\n    45→- Do not substitute easier-to-implement elements for what the mockup shows. If a table has columns that require joins or computed values, test for all those columns — do not replace them with simpler alternatives. If a mockup shows four filter controls, test for all four — not just the two easiest ones.\n    46→\n    47→- For every clickable element, the test entry must specify the exact navigation target or action result. Do not leave navigation destinations ambiguous. For buttons that trigger external flows (OAuth, SSO, payment, etc.), specify how the flow opens (popup window, redirect, etc.) and what happens when it completes.\n    48→\n    49→- For any user action that mutates data, write test entries verifying that the change is persisted correctly and that exactly the right side effects occur (e.g. history/timeline entries are created, and only one per action — not duplicates).\n    50→\n    51→- Button and control appearance matters: if a mockup shows specific text, icons, or styling for a button, the test entry should verify that appearance — not just that some button exists.\n    52→\n    53→- Completely test that modal dialogs work properly.\n    54→\n    55→- Attachment functionality should support file uploads unless the mockup specifically indicates something else.\n    56→\n    57→- Import/upload dialogs must specify the expected data format (e.g., required columns, accepted values, file type). Test entries should verify that format documentation is visible to the user before they attempt the import.\n    58→\n    59→- Backend integrations that the user can configure (webhooks, API connections, OAuth apps, etc.) must include\n    60→  complete setup instructions visible in the configuration UI. The instructions must be specific to each\n    61→  supported external service (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Slack, Discord) — not just a generic URL field. Show the\n    62→  user where to find the webhook/endpoint URL in the external service, what payload format they will receive,\n    63→  and any required configuration on the external side. Test entries should verify that these instructions are\n    64→  visible and accurate for each supported platform.\n    65→\n    66→- State-changing actions must have tests that when performed other parts of the app update appropriately. For example:\n    67→* If the app has a timeline or history feature, every mutation that the timeline tracks must write a history entry. Ensure this happens atomically to avoid duplicates from re-renders. Think through every field that can change and whether it needs history tracking.\n    68→\n    69→## Tips\n    70→\n    71→- Mockup images hosted on utfs.io cannot be fetched via WebFetch. Download them with\n    72→  `curl -L -o <local-path> <url>` and then use the Read tool to view the downloaded image files.\n    73→- When starting from scratch with no existing docs/plan.md, create and commit it before moving on\n    74→  to PlanPage jobs. This avoids losing the architecture docs if the iteration runs out of turns.\n    75→- The PlanPages job must produce output quickly. Do NOT spend excessive turns reading files\n    76→  through Task/Explore agents or re-reading files you have already seen.

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n   135→`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\n   136→the deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n   137→\n   138→## Running Tests\n   139→\n   140→Run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\n   141→for the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n   142→\n   143→- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n   144→- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n   145→\n   146→## Debugging\n   147→\n   148→When tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\n   149→mandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n   150→\n   151→1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n   152→2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   153→   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   154→   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   155→   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   156→   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   157→   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   158→   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n   159→3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n   160→4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   161→   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   162→   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   163→   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n   164→5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   165→   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n   166→6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   167→   on what you found.\n   168→\n   169→### Bug Writeup Template\n   170→\n   171→For each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n   172→\n   173→```\n   174→# Bug: <test name>\n   175→\n   176→## Step 1: Evidence\n   177→\n   178→Evidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\n   179→responses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\n   180→no evidence.>\n   181→\n   182→Evidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\n   183→selectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n   184→\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n   185→\n   186→## Step 2: Determination\n   187→\n   188→Which is broken: <APP or TEST>\n   189→\n   190→## Step 3: Root Cause\n   191→\n   192→<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\n   193→function(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n   194→```\n   195→\n   196→Do NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\n   197→Do NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\n   198→Do NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\n   199→The Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n   200→\n   201→When testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n   202→\n   203→## Directives\n   204→\n   205→- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing. Let Playwright's built-in `webServer` config\n   206→  handle the dev server — it starts and stops the server automatically per test run, avoiding\n   207→  zombie processes and port conflicts. Only use manual `netlify dev` for one-off curl checks.\n   208→\n   209→- If you do manually start `netlify dev` for curl testing, you MUST pass `--functions ./netlify/functions`\n   210→  to avoid 404 errors on function endpoints. The `base` setting in `netlify.toml` causes the functions\n   211→  directory to resolve incorrectly without this flag. Example:\n   212→  `npx netlify dev --port 8888 --functions ./netlify/functions`\n   213→\n   214→- After making code changes to Netlify Functions or frontend code during a testing session, ALWAYS\n   215→  restart the dev server before re-running tests. The dev server may cache old function bundles.\n   216→  Kill background processes with `pkill -f \"netlify\"` and `pkill -f \"vite\"` before restarting.\n   217→\n   218→- All browsers must run headless. Never use Xvfb, never set `DISPLAY`, never use the `[REDACTED]io record`\n   219→  CLI (it launches a headed browser). Use `@[REDACTED]io/playwright` for recordings.\n   220→\n   221→- The Playwright config MUST use `fullyParallel: true` and `workers` > 1 (or the default). Do NOT\n   222→  set `workers: 1` — tests must be designed to run concurrently. If tests interfere with each other,\n   223→  fix the isolation (database branches, unique test data), not the parallelism.\n   224→\n   225→- Tests MUST NOT run against the production database or the main Neon branch. The test script\n   226→  creates ephemeral Neon branches for test runs and deletes them afterwards.\n   227→\n   228→- NEVER stop, cancel, or skip a Replay recording upload that is in progress. The upload is a\n   229→  prerequisite for Replay MCP analysis, which is mandatory for debugging failures. If the upload\n   230→  is taking a long time, WAIT for it to finish. Do NOT proceed with fixes based on \"enough\n   231→  information\" — you must complete the full upload → MCP analysis → fix cycle. Stopping an\n   232→  upload to \"save time\" violates the debugging process and leads to guesswork-based fixes.\n   233→\n   234→- Always run tests via `npm run test <testFile>` (from the app directory), never by calling\n   235→  `npx playwright test` directly. The test script includes essential pre-test setup (branch\n   236→  creation, schema init, seeding, stale cleanup) that is skipped when running Playwright directly.\n   237→\n   238→## Tips\n   239→\n   240→- When a test times out inside a `.toPass()` block, use `mcp__[REDACTED]__PlaywrightSteps` first. It\n   241→  shows the exact sequence of Playwright actions with timestamps and return values. Look for a\n   242→  step that is stuck auto-waiting for an element — this reveals nested-wait deadlocks where the\n   243→  DOM changed mid-iteration and an inner `textContent()` or `count()` call is waiting on an\n   244→  element that was removed. The fix is always in the test: replace the iteration loop with a\n   245→  single atomic Playwright assertion (see the nested-wait directive in writeTests.md).\n   246→- When debugging history/timeline tests, check for duplicate entries caused by React re-renders triggering multiple API calls, and check for missing entries from mutation handlers that skip history writes.\n   247→- When many detail-page tests fail with \"expected count > 0, received 0\", the root cause is almost\n   248→  always that the database has no seed data OR the API functions are not working. Check both before\n   249→  attempting to fix individual tests.\n   250→- When filter/search tests return wrong data (e.g., filtering by \"proposal\" returns \"Qualification\"),\n   251→  the root cause may be that the SQL query is silently broken. Verify the API returns correctly\n   252→  filtered results by curling the endpoint directly with filter parameters.\n   253→- Tests that pass individually but fail in the full suite usually indicate data contamination between\n   254→  tests. With per-worker database branches, cross-worker contamination is impossible. If tests within\n   255→  the same worker interfere, make tests that create/modify/delete data operate on their own isolated\n   256→  records or re-seed the worker's branch in `beforeAll`.\n   257→- When test IDs differ between spec files (cross-cutting vs page-specific), decide on ONE canonical\n   258→  set of IDs in the component and update whichever test file has fewer references.\n   259→- When testing unauthenticated scenarios with `browser.newContext()`, always pass\n   260→  `storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] }` to ensure a truly empty context. Without this,\n   261→  Supabase or other auth libraries may detect cached sessions from previous test runs, causing\n   262→  \"unauthenticated\" tests to appear authenticated.\n   263→- If many tests suddenly fail with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` partway\n   264→  through a test run, the dev server crashed mid-suite. Do NOT debug individual test failures —\n   265→  they are all caused by the same server crash. Re-run the full suite. If the crash recurs, check\n   266→  for memory pressure or port conflicts from zombie processes.\n   267→- Zombie processes (`<defunct>`) from previous `vite` or `netlify` runs are harmless and cannot be\n   268→  killed (they are orphaned child processes waiting for PID 1 to reap them). Ignore them. The\n   269→  Playwright `webServer` config starts fresh processes on different ports and is not affected.\n   270→- Commit incrementally during debugging sessions. If you improve test results (e.g., 81→207 passing)\n   271→  or fix a meaningful issue, commit those changes immediately even if other failures remain. An\n   272→  iteration that produces zero commits despite significant work (strategy updates, code fixes,\n   273→  debugging progress) is wasted effort because the next iteration starts from scratch.\n   274→- Before running tests, verify `NEON_PROJECT_ID` is set in the environment. The test script\n   275→  requires it for creating ephemeral Neon branches. The project ID for SalesCRM is\n   276→  `rough-lake-81841975` — set it with `export NEON_PROJECT_ID=rough-lake-81841975`.\n   277→- Running the full test suite at once (e.g., `npx playwright test` with no file argument) can\n   278→  OOM or crash with `ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG` on large suites. Always run tests one spec file at a\n   279→  time using `npm run test tests/<file>.spec.ts` (which uses the test script that manages\n   280→  database branches). When verifying broad changes, pick the most relevant 2-3 spec files.\n   281→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01KspUEactnUBgCHPBQ61yfB","session_id":"3cab2b26-0051-4405-b636-83130a458029","uuid":"3dad1857-c976-4985-86b4-0287a99fb7f5"}

Do not substitute a URL/text input test for a file upload test —\n    45→  this masks missing upload functionality in the app.\n    46→\n    47→- NEVER put Playwright locator calls with auto-wait semantics (e.g. `count()`, `textContent()`,\n    48→  `isVisible()`) inside a `.toPass()` retry block in a way that iterates over dynamic elements.\n    49→  If the DOM changes mid-iteration, an inner locator call will auto-wait for an element that no\n    50→  longer exists, and `.toPass()` cannot interrupt that inner wait to retry the block — the test\n    51→  deadlocks. Instead, use a single atomic Playwright assertion that has built-in retry:\n    52→\n    53→  BAD — nested waits deadlock when DOM changes mid-loop:\n    54→  ```ts\n    55→  await expect(async () => {\n    56→    const cards = page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]');\n    57→    const count = await cards.count();\n    58→    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n    59→      const text = await cards.nth(i).textContent(); // hangs if DOM shrinks\n    60→      if (text?.includes(name)) found = true;\n    61→    }\n    62→    expect(found).toBeFalsy();\n    63→  }).toPass({ timeout: 15000 });\n    64→  ```\n    65→\n    66→  GOOD — single atomic assertion with built-in retry, no nested waits:\n    67→  ```ts\n    68→  await expect(\n    69→    page.locator('[data-testid^=\"card-\"]').filter({ hasText: name })\n    70→  ).toHaveCount(0, { timeout: 15000 });\n    71→  ```\n    72→\n    73→  The same principle applies to any `.toPass()` block: keep the body free of Playwright auto-waiting\n    74→  calls that can block indefinitely. Use locator chaining (`.filter()`, `.locator()`) and\n    75→  single-assertion expect matchers (`.toHaveCount()`, `.toContainText()`, `.toBeVisible()`) instead.\n    76→\n    77→- Strategy files are at `/repo/strategies/jobs/` and its subdirectories (the repo root), NOT inside\n    78→  the app directory. Always use `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/writeTests.md`, etc.\n    79→\n    80→- When a test spec entry describes editing or interacting with a specific field (e.g., \"edit client\n    81→  field\", \"change value\"), the test must exercise that exact field with corresponding actions and\n    82→  assertions. Do not write a test that only verifies a subset of the fields or operations mentioned\n    83→  in the spec entry — each described interaction must be tested. A common bug is implementing editing\n    84→  for some fields but not all; only per-field testing catches this.\n    85→\n    86→- Apps with login/signup functionality must have a complete e2e test that exercises the full\n    87→  sign-up and sign-in flow against the real auth backend. The test must create a new account,\n    88→  verify the post-signup state (session established or confirmation required), then sign in\n    89→  with the new credentials and verify the authenticated state. This catches issues like email\n    90→  confirmation requirements, incorrect error handling, and session establishment failures that\n    91→  unit-level or mocked tests miss.\n    92→\n    93→## Parallel Test Design\n    94→\n    95→Tests run in parallel across multiple Playwright workers, each with its own isolated database branch.\n    96→Write tests with this in mind:\n    97→\n    98→- Tests within the same spec file share a worker and therefore a database branch. Tests across\n    99→  different spec files may run in separate workers with separate databases.\n   100→- Tests that create, modify, or delete records must not rely on a fixed total count of records\n   101→  in the database (e.g., \"expect 5 clients\"). Other tests in the same worker may have already\n   102→  created or deleted records. Instead, assert on specific records by name/ID, or use relative\n   103→  assertions (\"at least N\", \"contains this item\").\n   104→- Tests that need a pristine dataset should create their own records in `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`\n   105→  and clean them up in `afterAll`/`afterEach`, rather than depending on the global seed data\n   106→  being unmodified.\n   107→- Never hardcode database IDs in tests. Query the UI or API to discover IDs for the records\n   108→  you need to interact with.\n   109→- The Playwright config must use `fullyParallel: true`. Do not set `workers: 1`.\n   110→\n   111→## Tips\n   112→\n   113→- Before writing tests that interact with shared UI components (ConfirmDialog, modals, dropdowns),\n   114→  read the shared component first to get the exact `data-testid` values. Do not guess test IDs.\n   115→- When adding `data-testid` attributes to a set of components for a page, plan ALL testid additions\n   116→  upfront by reading all components first, then make edits in batches. This avoids repeated re-reads\n   117→  and sequential small edits to the same file.\n   118→- When writing tests for a detail page, read: (1) the Netlify function for the entity, (2) the page\n   119→  component, (3) 2-3 representative section components. Do not exhaustively read every file in the app.\n   120→- If Playwright browser installation fails with permission errors, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to\n   121→  a writable directory (e.g., `/home/node/.cache/ms-playwright`) before running `npx playwright install`.\n   122→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_01KspUEactnUBgCHPBQ61yfB","session_id":"3cab2b26-0051-4405-b636-83130a458029","uuid":"d016c03c-8ba2-4226-aa52-ec588455940a"}

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me create a summary document with all the files I found:\n\n## Summary of Test Documentation Files\n\nI have successfully located and analyzed the test documentation and test files in the `/repo` directory. Here's what I found:\n\n### 1. **Test Specification Documentation**\n- **File**: `/repo/apps/SalesCRM/docs/tests.md` (1,655 lines)\n  - This is the primary test specification document for the Sales CRM application\n  - Organized by page with detailed test entries\n  - Includes sections for:\n    - Authentication (SidebarUserArea, ForgotPasswordPage, ResetPasswordPage, ConfirmEmailPage)\n    - ClientsListPage (/clients)\n    - ClientDetailPage (/clients/:clientId)\n    - DealsListPage (/deals)\n    - **DealDetailPage (/deals/:dealId)** - Lines 997-1194\n    - TasksListPage (/tasks)\n    - And more pages...\n  - Each test entry follows Behavior-Driven Development format with: Initial conditions, Actions, and Expected outcomes\n  - Test IDs are structured (e.g., `DDP-BRC-01`, `DDP-HDR-01`, `DDP-PIP-01`, etc.)\n\n### 2. **Testing Strategy Files** (in `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/`)\n\n#### a. **testSpec.md** \n- **File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testSpec.md`\n- Strategy for writing a complete test specification from an app specification\n- Key requirements:\n  - Test spec written in `docs/tests.md`\n  - Organized by page with test entries\n  - BDD format (initial state, action, expected outcome)\n  - Every interactive element must be tested\n  - Must include download/read instructions for mockup images\n  - Tests must verify side effects (history entries, timeline updates)\n\n#### b. **testing.md**\n- **File**: `/repo/strategies/jobs/build/testing.md`\n- Strategy for running and debugging tests with Replay.io browser recordings\n- Key sections:\n  - Replay.io Playwright installation (v5.0.1 with [REDACTED]Reporter and devices)\n  - Running tests via `npm run test`\n  - Mandatory debugging process with Replay MCP analysis\n  - Bug writeup template for failures\n  -

Let me analyze what's missing:\n\n1. **DDP-HDR-05**: There is no test entry for \"owner editing\" in the DealHeader section. Looking at the test spec in docs/tests.md, I see:\n   - DDP-HDR-01: Header displays deal info\n   - DDP-HDR-02: Editing client field\n   - DDP-HDR-03: Editing value field\n   - DDP-HDR-04: Changing stage\n\n   The Components section says: \"editable fields for Client, Value, Owner, Stage dropdown\" - but there's no test for editing the Owner field. \n\n2. **DDP-MET-02**: The test entry says \"Metrics are editable\" but only tests editing the probability. The Components section mentions both \"Probability percentage and Expected Close date\". The test entry doesn't cover editing the expected close date. Looking at the actual test code in deal-detail-page.spec.ts, DDP-MET-02 only edits probability, not the close date.\n\nSo I need to add DDP-HDR-05 for owner editing and update DDP-MET-02 to include the close date editing test.\n\nLet me start working through these fixes.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":21673,"cache_read_input_tokens":28507,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":21673,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3cab2b26-0051-4405-b636-83130a458029","uuid":"58940163-dc52-468e-9bbc-5097c70bf74a"}

How the Owner Field is Rendered\n\n**Display Mode (not editing):**\n- Data-testid: `deal-header-owner`\n- Shows: `deal.owner ?? '—'` (displays the owner name or a dash if empty)\n- Located at line 185\n\n**Edit Mode:**\n- Data-testid: `deal-header-owner-input`\n- Two different implementations depending on availability:\n  1. **With availableUsers** (lines 164-174): Uses a `FilterSelect` dropdown component\n     - Searchable dropdown\n     - Options include \"— None —\" as the first option, then all available user names\n     - Maps users by their `name` property\n  2. **Without availableUsers** (lines 176-182): Falls back to a text input field\n     - Regular text input for manual entry\n     - Same styling as the value field\n\n### 2. Edit Mode for Owner\n\n**Edit Mode Toggle:**\n- Lines 31-40: Uses `useState(false)` for the `editing` state\n- Edit button (lines 98-105): Pencil icon button with data-testid `deal-header-edit-button`\n- When editing is true, the owner field switches to an interactive control\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n- Owner state: `const [owner, setOwner] = useState(deal.owner ?? '')`\n- The dropdown is **searchable** like the client dropdown (line 169)\n- Accepts null values (the \"— None —\" option at line 171)\n- Owner value is stored as a string (the user's name)\n\n### 3. Save/Cancel Flow\n\n**Save Flow (lines 49-60):**\n```typescript\nasync function handleSave() {\n  const data: Record<string, unknown> = {\n    name: name.trim(),\n    value: parseFloat(value) || 0,\n    owner: owner.trim() || null,  // Trims and converts empty string to null\n  }\n  if (clientId !== deal.client_id) {\n    data.client_id = clientId\n  }\n  await onUpdate(data)  // Async update\n  setEditing(false)     // Exits edit mode\n}\n```\n- Data-testid for save button: `deal-header-save-button`\n- Calls the `onUpdate` callback with the updated data\n- Trims owner value and converts empty strings to null\n- Exits edit mode after save completes\n\n**Cancel Flow (lines 62-68):**\n```typescript\nfunction handleCancel() {\n  setName(deal.name)\n  setValue(String(deal.value))\n  setOwner(deal.owner ?? '')\n  setClientId(deal.client_id)\n  setEditing(false)\n}\n```\n- Data-testid for cancel button: `deal-header-cancel-button`\n- Resets all fields to their original values from the `deal` prop\n- Exits edit mode without saving\n\n**Button Display:**\n- Lines 97-125: Conditionally renders either an edit button (not editing) or save/cancel buttons (editing)\n- Save button (green, Check icon): `deal-header-save-button`\n- Cancel button (red, X icon): `deal-header-cancel-button`\n\n### Summary of Data-testid Patterns\n\n| Element | Data-testid |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Header container | `deal-detail-header` |\n| Title (display) | `deal-header-title` |\n| Name input (edit) | `deal-header-name-input` |\n| Edit button | `deal-header-edit-button` |\n| Save button | `deal-header-save-button` |\n| Cancel button | `deal-header-cancel-button` |\n| Owner (display) | `deal-header-owner` |\n| Owner input (edit) | `deal-header-owner-input` |\n| Client (display) | `deal-header-client` |\n| Client input (edit) | `deal-header-client-input` |\n| Value input (edit) | `deal-header-value-input` |\n| Value (display) | `deal-header-value` |\n| Stage select | `deal-header-stage-select` |\n| Change stage button | `deal-header-change-stage-button` |\n\nThe owner field behaves very similarly to the client field—when `availableUsers` is provided, it uses a searchable dropdown; otherwise, it falls back to a text input."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a51707c (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\n<usage>total_tokens: 19510\ntool_uses: 6\nduration_ms: 13868</usage>"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3cab2b26-0051-4405-b636-83130a458029","uuid":"0c71b17e-a0f8-4ff6-aef3-c7faf06aebb2","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Search for the DealDetailHeader or DealHeader component in /repo/apps/SalesCRM/src.

Authentication\n\n### Components\n- **SidebarUserArea**: Current user info area in the upper left of the sidebar, below the app title. When logged in, shows user avatar/initial, name, and sign-out button. When not logged in, shows a \"Sign in\" button that expands to an email/password form with sign-in and sign-up modes. The sign-in form includes a \"Forgot password?\" link. Sign-up requires email confirmation before login (in production; auto-confirmed in test mode).\n- **ForgotPasswordPage**: Page at /auth/forgot-password with a form to enter email and request a password reset link.\n- **ResetPasswordPage**: Page at /auth/reset-password?token=... with a form to enter a new password.\n- **ConfirmEmailPage**: Page at /auth/confirm-email?token=... that confirms a user's email and signs them in.\n\n### Test Entries\n\n#### SidebarUserArea\n\n**AUTH-USR-01: Sidebar displays authenticated user info in upper left**\n- Initial: User is authenticated and on any page\n- Action: Observe the sidebar user area\n- Expected: The sidebar shows the user area (data-testid=\"sidebar-user-area\") below the app title containing the authenticated user's name (data-testid=\"sidebar-user-name\"), avatar or initial (data-testid=\"sidebar-user-avatar\"), and a sign-out button (data-testid=\"sidebar-sign-out\").\n\n**AUTH-USR-02: Sidebar displays sign-in button when not logged in**\n- Initial: User is not authenticated and on any page\n- Action: Observe the sidebar user area\n- Expected: The sidebar shows the user area (data-testid=\"sidebar-user-area\") below the app title containing a \"Sign in\" button (data-testid=\"sidebar-sign-in\"). Clicking it reveals an email/password form (data-testid=\"sidebar-auth-form\") with email input (data-testid=\"auth-email-input\"), password input (data-testid=\"auth-password-input\"), submit button (data-testid=\"auth-submit-button\"), a \"Forgot password?\" link (data-testid=\"auth-forgot-password\"), and a toggle to switch between sign-in and sign-up modes (data-testid=\"auth-toggle-mode\").\n\n**AUTH-USR-03: App loads without authentication**\n- Initial: User is not authenticated\n- Action: Navigate to /clients\n- Expected: The clients page loads and displays data without requiring login. The sidebar is visible with navigation links and the sign-in button.\n\n**AUTH-E2E-01: Full signup and login flow works end-to-end**\n- Initial: User is not authenticated\n- Action: Click \"Sign in\", toggle to sign-up mode, enter a new email/password, submit. Then sign out. Then sign back in with the same credentials.\n- Expected: After signup, user is immediately logged in (user name and avatar visible, sign-out button visible).

This section describes\n    44→the exact installation steps and configuration required.\n    45→\n    46→### 1. Install dependencies\n    47→\n    48→The app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n    49→\n    50→```bash\n    51→npm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\n    55→for integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n    56→\n    57→### 2. Install the Replay browser\n    58→\n    59→Run once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n    60→\n    61→```bash\n    62→npx [REDACTED]io install\n    63→```\n    64→\n    65→This downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\n    66→Verify it exists:\n    67→\n    68→```bash\n    69→ls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n    70→```\n    71→\n    72→### 3. API key\n    73→\n    74→`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\n    75→container. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n    76→\n    77→```ts\n    78→apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n    79→```\n    80→\n    81→### 4. Playwright config\n    82→\n    83→The Playwright config MUST:\n    84→\n    85→1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n    86→2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n    87→   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n    88→3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n    89→   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n    90→   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n    91→   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n    92→   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n    93→\n    94→**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n    95→`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\n    96→which breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n    97→\n    98→Example:\n    99→\n   100→```ts\n   101→import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n   102→import { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n   103→\n   104→export default defineConfig({\n   105→  reporter: [\n   106→    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n   107→      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n   108→      upload: false,\n   109→    }),\n   110→    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n   111→    ['list'],\n   112→  ],\n   113→  use: {\n   114→    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n   115→  },\n   116→});\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n   120→\n   121→- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n   122→- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n   123→  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n   124→  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n   125→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n   126→- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n   127→- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n   128→  data accumulating).\n   129→\n   130→### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n   131→\n   132→The Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\n   133→container only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\n   134→test output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr).

This section describes\nthe exact installation steps and configuration required.\n\n### 1. Install dependencies\n\nThe app's `package.json` must include these dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @[REDACTED]io/playwright @playwright/test\n```\n\n`@[REDACTED]io/playwright` (currently v5.0.1) provides the `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices` exports\nfor integrating Replay recordings into Playwright.\n\n### 2. Install the Replay browser\n\nRun once in the container (or as part of CI setup):\n\n```bash\nnpx [REDACTED]io install\n```\n\nThis downloads the Replay Chromium browser to `~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome`.\nVerify it exists:\n\n```bash\nls ~/.[REDACTED]/runtimes/chrome-linux/chrome\n```\n\n### 3. API key\n\n`RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY` must be set in the environment. It is already available in this\ncontainer. The Playwright config passes it to the reporter via:\n\n```ts\napiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY\n```\n\n### 4. Playwright config\n\nThe Playwright config MUST:\n\n1. Import BOTH `[REDACTED]Reporter` and `devices as [REDACTED]Devices` from `@[REDACTED]io/playwright`.\n2. Include `[REDACTED]Reporter(...)` in the `reporter` array with `upload: false`. Uploads are\n   handled by the test script, NOT by the reporter.\n3. Spread `[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']` into the global `use` config. This sets\n   `executablePath`, `RECORD_ALL_CONTENT`, and critically `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE` which\n   is required for the reporter to attach test metadata (pass/fail result) to recordings.\n   Without `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`, the recording driver cannot read the per-test\n   metadata written by the fixture, and all recordings will have empty `testResult`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT manually set `launchOptions.executablePath` and `env` instead of using\n`[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium']`. Manual config misses `RECORD_REPLAY_METADATA_FILE`,\nwhich breaks the recording-to-test metadata association.\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\nimport { devices as [REDACTED]Devices, [REDACTED]Reporter } from '@[REDACTED]io/playwright';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  reporter: [\n    [REDACTED]Reporter({\n      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY ?? process.env.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY,\n      upload: false,\n    }),\n    ['json', { outputFile: 'test-results/results.json' }],\n    ['list'],\n  ],\n  use: {\n    ...[REDACTED]Devices['Replay Chromium'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 5. Replay CLI commands reference\n\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list` — List all local recordings (ID, host, date, duration, status).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` — Full JSON metadata for all recordings. Each entry includes:\n  `id`, `buildId`, `date`, `duration`, `metadata` (host, URI, sourceMaps, processType),\n  `path`, `recordingStatus` (one of `\"recording\"`, `\"finished\"`, `\"crashed\"`).\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>` — Upload a single recording by ID. Returns the viewable URL.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io upload --all` — Upload all local recordings.\n- `npx [REDACTED]io remove --all` — Delete all local recordings (use between runs to avoid stale\n  data accumulating).\n\n### 6. OpenSSL 1.1 requirement\n\nThe Replay browser's recording driver requires `libcrypto.so.1.1` (OpenSSL 1.1). If the\ncontainer only has OpenSSL 3, the browser will run but silently fail to record (no error in\ntest output, just `DoLoadDriverHandle: dlopen failed` in stderr). Fix: download Ubuntu 18.04's\n`libssl1.1` deb, extract it, and set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point at the extracted libs. See\nthe deployment Playwright config for a working example.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRun tests via `npm run test <testFile>` from the app directory (see `strategies/scripts/test.md`\nfor the full script specification). Do NOT manually run playwright or start dev servers.\n\n- Write the results to a logs/test-run-N.log file.\n- Tests MUST run in parallel with multiple workers (use `fullyParallel: true` in playwright config).\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen tests fail, you MUST follow this process for each distinct failure. Every step is\nmandatory — do NOT skip or reorder steps.\n\n1. Announce `ANALYZING TEST FAILURE: <test name>`.\n2. Find the uploaded recording IDs in the `npm run test` output. The test script automatically\n   uploads failed recordings and logs full metadata for each one. Look for the\n   `=== REPLAY RECORDINGS METADATA ===` block and the `REPLAY UPLOADED: <recordingId>` lines\n   in the output. Choose the recording whose URI and duration best match the failing test. If\n   the upload did not happen (e.g., the script was misconfigured), use\n   `npx [REDACTED]io list --json` to find recordings and upload them manually:\n   `npx [REDACTED]io upload <id>`.\n3. Announce `TEST FAILURE UPLOADED: <recordingId>` before doing anything else.\n4. Use Replay MCP tools to analyze the failure. Pick the tool that fits the failure:\n   `PlaywrightSteps`, `ConsoleMessages`, `NetworkRequest`, `SearchSources`, `Logpoint`,\n   `Evaluate`, `GetStack`, `ReactComponents`, `Screenshot`, etc. Use as many as needed to\n   understand what actually happened before making any changes.\n5. Write a bug writeup to `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` following the investigative template below.\n   You MUST fill in every section before making any code changes.\n6. Only after completing the Replay analysis AND the bug writeup, fix the test and/or app based\n   on what you found.\n\n### Bug Writeup Template\n\nFor each test failure, create `docs/bugs/<TestName>.md` with exactly this structure:\n\n```\n# Bug: <test name>\n\n## Step 1: Evidence\n\nEvidence the app is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong API\nresponses, incorrect state, missing data, UI rendering issues, etc. Write \"None found\" if\nno evidence.>\n\nEvidence the test is broken: <describe concrete evidence from Replay analysis — wrong\nselectors, bad assertions, race conditions, incorrect test data expectations, etc. Write\n\"None found\" if no evidence.>\n\n## Step 2: Determination\n\nWhich is broken: <APP or TEST>\n\n## Step 3: Root Cause\n\n<Completely explain the cause of the problem in the app or test. Include the specific file(s),\nfunction(s), and line(s) involved. Explain WHY the code is wrong, not just WHAT is wrong.>\n```\n\nDo NOT skip Replay analysis and jump straight to reading error messages or guessing at fixes.\nDo NOT skip the bug writeup and jump straight to fixing code.\nDo NOT stop or cancel a recording upload because it is \"taking a while\" — wait for it to complete.\nThe Replay recording contains the actual runtime state — use it.\n\nWhen testing the app after deployment, use the Replay browser to record the app and debug any problems.\n\n## Directives\n\n- Do NOT manually start `netlify dev` for testing.
