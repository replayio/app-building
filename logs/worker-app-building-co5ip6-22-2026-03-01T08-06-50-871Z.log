You will build and/or maintain one or more\nweb apps according to a set of skills and guidelines which will evolve as you get better at building apps.\n\nKey directories:\n\n* `apps`: Has one subdirectory for each app that has been built or has been specified and still needs to be built.\n* `skills/messages`: Skills for responding to messages from the user (e.g. bug reports, log analysis).\n* `skills/tasks`: Skills for performing tasks. See `skills/AGENTS.md` for details.\n* `reports`: Generated reports from log analysis (see `skills/review/`).\n* `tasks`: The task queue (`tasks-<containerName>.json`) managed by scripts in `scripts/`.\n* `logs`: Log files from work that has been performed. `worker-current.log` is the log for\n  the work currently being done.\n\nYou are running within a container and can run test suites for applications and connect to various\nexternal services using instructions in the relevant skill files.\n\n**CRITICAL — FIRST THING YOU DO when responding to a user message:**\n\n1. **BEFORE doing ANY work**, list the files in `skills/messages/` and read any skill\n   whose name matches the user's request.\n2. If a matching skill exists, follow it exactly.\n3. Only if no matching skill exists should you proceed on your own — and then write a new\n   skill document in `skills/messages/` afterward so you handle it correctly next time.\n\nDo NOT run git commands, search code, or take any other action until you have checked for a\nmatching skill. This is the highest-priority rule when handling user messages.\n\n## Worker Execution\n\nThe worker processes tasks from `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json` sequentially. For each task,\nit passes all subtasks to Claude as a single prompt and checks for a `<DONE>` signal.\n\n- If `<DONE>` is signaled: the task is dequeued and the worker moves to the next task.\n- If `<DONE>` is NOT signaled: the task is retried (up to 3 times before being skipped).\n\nThe worker commits changes after each task automatically. Focus on completing the\nsubtasks — do not worry about committing or exiting.\n\nWhen you have completed ALL subtasks in your task, output `<DONE>` to signal completion.\n\n## Task System\n\nWork is managed through a JSON task queue at `tasks/tasks-<containerName>.json`. The file contains an object\nwith a `tasks` array. Each task has a `skill`, an array of `subtasks` (description strings),\na `timestamp`, and an optional `app` name:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"skill\": \"skills/tasks/maintain/checkDirectives.md\",\n      \"subtasks\": [\n        \"CheckTestSpecAuth: Check testSpec.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckComponentsAuth: Check writeApp.md directive violations in Authentication\",\n        \"CheckTestsAuth: Check writeTests.md directive violations in Authentication\"\n      ],\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"app\": \"sales-crm\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe agent NEVER reads or writes task files directly. Instead, use:\n\n* **`npx tsx /repo/scripts/add-task.ts --skill \"<path>\" --subtask \"desc1\" --subtask \"desc2\" [--app \"<name>\"] [--trailing]`**:\n  Adds a task to the FRONT of the queue (next to be processed). Each `--subtask` flag\n  adds one subtask to the task. Subtasks execute in the order listed.\n  Use `--app` to associate the task with a specific app (the directory name under `apps/`).\n  Add `--trailing` to append to the END of the queue instead.\n\nAll subtasks in a task share the same skill. Group related subtasks together — for example,\nall checks for a single page go in one task. When a skill needs to \"unpack\" into\nsub-tasks, use `add-task` to insert them at the front of the queue.\n\n**CRITICAL: Task scope rules**\n\n- You MUST only work on subtasks that were assigned to you in your current prompt. Your assigned\n  subtasks are the ones passed to you by the worker — nothing else.\n- When you add new tasks via `add-task`, you MUST NOT start working on those tasks.\n  They will be picked up by a future worker iteration.\n- If you have completed all of your assigned subtasks and the only remaining work is tasks you\n  added to the queue, you are DONE. Commit your changes and output `<DONE>` immediately.\n  Do NOT continue working on the newly queued tasks.\n- Adding tasks to the queue is NOT the same as doing those tasks. Add them and stop.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- **Vite** for build tooling\n- **TypeScript** for all source code (strict mode)\n- **React 18** for UI (single-page application)\n- **Redux** for client side state management\n- **shadcn/ui** for components\n- **Neon** for database backend (Postgres).\n- **Netlify Functions** for any backend/serverless functions.

The app uses plain CSS (no Tailwind), so I need to add responsive CSS media queries. Let me analyze what responsive work is needed for each page:\n\n## MainPage\nCurrent responsive:\n- MainPage.css: Already has `@media (max-width: 640px)` for padding\n- AppCardGrid.css: Already has `@media (max-width: 640px)` for single column\n- StatusFilter.css: No responsive - tabs might overflow on narrow screens\n- RequestAppCTA.css: No responsive - but it's already block/full-width\n\n\n- AppCard.css: No responsive - card padding could be reduced on mobile\n\nI need to add media queries for StatusFilter to tighten up the spacing and font sizes, AppCard to reduce padding and scale down the title on smaller screens, and RequestAppCTA to make the text and padding more compact on mobile.\n\n## AppPage\nCurrent responsive:\n- AppPage.css: Already has `@media (max-width: 640px)` for padding\n- AppHeader.css: Already has `@media (max-width: 640px)` for title size and title-row direction\n- AppActions.css: Already has flex-wrap but could use button text hiding on narrow screens\n- Activity\n\nFor the Activity section, I'm looking at Log.css and ActivityLogEntry.css which both have flex-wrap but lack responsive breakpoints. I should add media queries to AppActions to hide button text and show icons only on narrow screens, reduce padding in ActivityLog, and make ActivityLogEntry more compact with smaller timestamps on mobile.\n\n## RequestPage\nCurrent responsive:\n- RequestPage.css: Already has `@media (max-width: 640px)` for padding\n- AssessmentScreen.css: Already has `@media (max-width: 640px)` for single column grid\n- WizardStepper.css: No responsive - connector min-width could overflow\n- DescribeAppForm.css: No responsive - inner padding reduction\n- RejectionResult.css: No responsive - padding reduction\n- AcceptanceResult.css: No responsive - padding reduction\n\nI need to add responsive breakpoints to WizardStepper to prevent the connector from overflowing, and tighten up padding in DescribeAppForm, RejectionResult, and AcceptanceResult on smaller screens.\n\n## StatusPage\nCurrent responsive:\n- StatusPage.css: Already has `@media (max-width: 640px)` for padding\n- ActiveContainers.css: No responsive - table columns need hiding\n- WebhookEventFeed.css: No responsive - but wraps somewhat\n- WebhookHelpButton.css: No responsive - panel already 90% width\n- DefaultPromptDisplay.css: No responsive\n\nFor StatusPage, I should make the header wrap on narrow screens and hide the Prompt and Last Event columns in ActiveContainers at smaller widths.\n\nFor the remaining components—WebhookEventFeed, WebhookHelpButton, and DefaultPromptDisplay—I need to reduce padding on narrow screens, and switch ActiveContainers to card mode at 480px.\n\nI'm going to work through each page systematically, using the consistent breakpoints: 640px, 768px, and 480px for the CSS-only card mode. The existing code already uses 640px, so I'll keep that and add the other breakpoints where needed.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6897,"cache_read_input_tokens":64992,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6897,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b648b89e-9948-4427-84a2-5b2e55482f2c","uuid":"2a087002-f541-497d-811d-caf31c9f
